" J U D G M E N T CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.   943           OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.1377 of 2007) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Leave granted. 2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dismissing the appeal filed under Section 34(1) (4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2000 (in short the ’POTA’).  There seems to be some confusion about the factual position and therefore the details are not necessary to be noted. 3.      Undisputedly, the challenge before the High Court was to the order dated 7.7.2004 passed by the Designated Judge, Special Court (POTA) Ahmedabad. There were two proceedings initiated against the appellant.  The first was Pota Case No. 08 of 2003 arising out of complaints, namely, I.C.R. No. 184 of 2002 registered at Kagdapith Police Station, I.C.R. No. 116 of 2002 registered at Vejalpur Police Station and I.C.R. No. 244 of 2002 registered at Satellite Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 120(B), 307, 337, 286 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’) read with Sections 3, 4 & 6 of Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (in short the ’Explosive Act’) and under Sections 3(3), 4,20, 21(2)(b) and 22(3) of the POTA.  It is to be noted that two appeals were filed by the appellant i.e. Criminal Appeal Nos.1287 of 2004 and 1288 of 2004.  The appellant has been acquitted from the charges leveled against him in POTA Case No.8 of 2003.  So far as the prayer for bail in POTA Case No.12 of 2003 is concerned, certain observations were made by the Court while dismissing Criminal appeal No. 1287 of 2004 on 21.9.2004.  The High Court noted that because of acquittal in POTA Case No.8 of 2003 wherein further revival in that case the appeal was infructuous. Obviously, the same relates to Criminal Appeal No. 1287 of 2004. So far as the Criminal appeal No.1288 of 2004 is concerned, the same relates to the POTA Case No.12 of 2003.  The High Court was therefore not justified in holding that the matter was concluded for various reasons in view of the observations made in the appeal relating to POTA Case No.8 of 2003. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 4.      A perusal of the documents on record shows that Criminal Appeal No.1288 of 2004 related to POTA Case No.12 of 2003. Whether any relief can be granted by the concerned Court in that POTA case was not considered. The confusion arose before the High Court relating to the case numbers. There is no dispute that Criminal Appeal No.1288 of 2004 before the High Court related to POTA Case No.12 of 2003. It appears that the High Court permitted the appellant to take a proper proceeding seeking his release on bail so far as POTA Case No.12 of 2003 is concerned. The High Court apparently failed to notice that Criminal Appeal No.1288 of 2004 related to POTA Case No.12 of 2003. In the circumstances we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter relating to Criminal Appeal No.1288 of 2004 to the High Court to consider the matter afresh in accordance with law. 5.      We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.","Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. challenges the order passed by the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court dismissing the appeal filed under Section 34(1) (4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2000 (in short the ’POTA’",transfer,25.43
" JUDGMENT O R D E R (arising out of SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL)NO.20850 OF 2005) 1.      Leave granted. 2.      The respondent was not satisfied with the order passed by the petitioner-appellant (the Superintending Archaeologist, A.S.I., Calcutta Circle) on 1.3.2002 holding  that respondent was not eligible for appointment on regular basis and for temporary status. The said order was passed pursuant to the direction of the Central Administrative Tribunal issue d on 5.12.2001 in O.A.NO.324/1994 to consider his case for absorption/regularisation.  He, therefore, filed contempt petition before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Benc h. The Tribunal passed an order on 10.1.2003 in the said contempt proceeding directing reconsideration of the case of the respondent afresh.  That order was challenged by the appellant before the High Court and the High Court has dismissed the same by the impugned order dated 21.4.2005. 3.      Though the respondent was served with a notice he has not chosen to enter appearance.  If the respondent was not satisfied with the order dated 1.3.2002, he ought to have challenged that order in a separate proceedings.  It could not be said that passing of the said order was a disobedience. Further, the Tribunal could not, in a contempt proceedings, direct the employer to reconsider its decision on merits. The order of the Tribunal and the High Court cannot be sustained. 4.      This appeal is, therefore, allowed and the said orders by the Central Administrative Tribunal and the High Court are set aside.      Liberty is, however, reserved to respondent to challenge the order dated 1.3.2002 in accordance with law.","The High Court has dismissed the same by the impugned order dated 21.4.2005.

" J U D G M E N T NON-REPORTABLE CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 587  OF 2008 [arising out of Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 79 of 2006) P.P. NAOLEKAR, J. 1.              Leave granted. 2.              The complainant Rajeshwari lodged a complaint on 4.9.2001 before the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar against the appellants.  The complaint under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was sent to the Police Station, Sadar Sri Ganganagar for investigation on which FIR No. 246 of 2001 was registered against the appellants for offences under Sections 498A, 406 and 147 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).   Challan was filed against the appellants in the Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganga Nagar.  The charges were framed against the appellants for offences under Sections 498A and 406 IPC.  The appellants made a prayer before the Court that the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate had no jurisdiction to try the offences as the cause of action accrued within the jurisdiction of the other court.  The application was rejected.  The Revision Petition before the learned Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar was also rejected.  The High Court dismissed the S.B. Criminal Miscellaneous Petition preferred by the appellants holding that although the marriage was solemnized at Village Ramsara, Tehsil Abohar, District Ferozpur, and right from the marriage, the complainant and her husband Ravindra Kumar were living in Punjab with her in-laws and  her husband had died, and that she is now residing in Sri Ganganagar District in Rajasthan along with her maternal relations, but still offence under Section 498A IPC, being a continuing one, the complaint cannot be dismissed on the ground that it was time barred; and that the offence of cruelty being a continuing  offence is still continuing with the local area of Rajasthan, where at present the complainant is living and, therefore, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar had jurisdiction to try the case.  The Court has found that all the allegations regarding the offences charged with have been committed at the previous residence of the complainant. 3.              It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the question involved is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in Y. Abraham Ajith and Others  vs.  Inspector of Police, Chennai and Another, (2004) 8 SCC 100, wherein this Court has held that cause of action having arisen within the jurisdiction of the court where the offence was committed, could not be tried by the court where no part of offence was committed. 4.              The facts stated in the complaint disclose that the complainant left the place where she was residing with her husband and in-laws and came to the city of Sri Ganganagar, State of Rajasthan and that all the alleged acts as per the complaint had taken place in the State of Punjab.  The Court at Rajasthan does not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  On the basis of the factual scenario disclosed by the complainant in the complaint, the inevitable conclusion is that no part of cause of action arose in Rajasthan http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and, therefore, the Magistrate concerned has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  As a consequence thereof, the proceedings before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar are quashed.  The complaint be returned to the complainant and if she so wishes she may file the same in the appropriate court to be dealt with in accordance with law. 5.              The appeal is accordingly allowed.","The complainant Rajeshwari lodged a complaint on 4.9.2001 before the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard the counsel for the parties. These appeals  are preferred  by the State of Karnataka against the  judgment of  a Division  Bench of the Karnakata High Court  allowing the  two writ  petitions filed  by  the respondent and  declaring that the Karnataka Inams Abolition Laws (Amendment)  Act, 1979  (Karnataka Act 26 of 1979) is a still-born, void  and invalid Act and declaring further that the  Mysore   (Religious  and  Charitable)  Inams  Abolition (Karnataka Amendment)  Act, 1984 is a superfluous enactment. It was  also declared  by the  High Court  that  the  Mysore (Religious and  Charitable) Inams  Abolition  Act,  1955  as amended in  1969 remains  unaffected by  the Karnataka Inams Abolitions Laws  (Amendment) Act,  1979. The decision of the Karnataka Appellate  Tribunal in  Appeal No.  453  of  1977, which was questioned by the State, was also affirmed. The respondent  was the  Inamdar of  a large  extent of land covering  9 villages.  They were  inam lands  and stood abolished under  the Inam  Abolition Act,  1955 with  effect from  1.4.59.  The  main  dispute  herein  pertains  to  the determination  of   the  Basic   annual  sum  to  which  the respondent is  entitled to. By an order dated 1st September, 1957 the  Deputy Commissioner  fixed the Basic annual sum at Rs. 2,815/-.  After the  coming into  force of the Amendment Act 33  of  69,  which  inter  alia  inserted  Section  21-A providing for  review of  the orders  determining the  Basic annual sum,  the  respondent  filed  a  revision  which  was allowed by  the Deputy  Commissioner by  his order dated 5th May, 1976.  Under this  order the Basic annual sum was fixed at Rs.  1,94,875/-. An  appeal preferred  by  the  State  of Karnataka against  the order  of the Deputy Commissioner was dismissed by the Appellate Tribunal. Then followed Amendment after Amendment, which it is not necessary to trace here for the reasons mentioned hereinafter. (Act 26 of 79 was enacted and then  came Act  24 of  1984 and ultimately the Amendment http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Act of  1995, the last-mentioned during the pendency of this matter in  this Court).  The High  Court has dealt with both the Amendment  Acts viz.,  Act 26 of 79 and Act 24 of 84 and has made  certain  declarations  and  directions.  The  1995 (Amendment) Act,  of course, was enacted and came into force after the impugned judgment was delivered by the High Court. The judgment  of the  High  Court  is  assailed  on  various grounds in these appeals. After hearing  the parties,  we are of the opinion that it  is   not  necessary,   in  the   particular  facts   and circumstances of  this case,  to go  into  or  consider  the several contentions  raised in  these appeals,  or for  that matter, considered  and pronounced  upon by  the High Court. Having regard to the extend of the land concerned herein and all the relevant facts and circumstances, we are inclined to think that  the determination of the Basic annual sum at Rs. 1,94, 875/-  is reasonable  and  adequate.  Accordingly,  we dismiss these  appeals without expressing any opinion on any of the  contentions raised  in these  appeals or,  for  that matter, upon  those considered  and adjudicated  upon by the High Court. Similarly we do not express any opinion upon the effect and validity of the Mysore (Religious and Charitable) Inams  Abolition   Karnataka  Amendment   Act,  1995   being Karnataka Act  29 of  1995. The  said questions  may be gone into in an appropriate case. The appeals  are accordingly  dismissed subject  to the above observations. No costs.","Karnataka Inams Abolition Laws (Amendment)  Act, 1979 is a still-born, void and invalid Act. Mysore (Religious and.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have called for the record to satisfy ourselves whether the Tribunal was justified in giving the direction in the impugned order. On perusal of the record, it is seen that except during the relevant period, either previous or subsequent to the period, the first respondent has outstanding career and the records are very good.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL  NO.1467 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.9330 of 2006) We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Delay condoned. Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11th November, 2005 in D.B.Civil Special Appeal (W) No. 290 of 2003 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan at Jaipur whereby the Division Bench has affirmed the order of the learned Single Judge.  Learned Single Judge has reduced the punishment of dismissal from service to the stoppage of six grade increments with future effect.  Learned Single Judge further directed that 50% of back wages be also paid  from the date of filing of the writ petition. The facts of the case are that the respondent herein was appointed as Constable in the Border Security -2- Force on 13th June, 1975.  Thereafter he was promoted from time to time.  He remained absent for a long time.  Therefore, a notice was issued to him but he did not respond and ultimately, he was removed from service.  This removal was challenged by the respondent (herein)  and the learned Single Judge having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case modified the order of removal from service to the withholding of six grade increments with future effect and awarded 50% of backwages. Aggrieved against this order, the Union of India filed a Letters Patent Appeal before the Division Bench.  The Division Bench affirmed the order of the learned Single Judge.  The Division Bench observed that the appellant herein was aware that the respondent was not keeping well and was also aware about the extension of his leave on medical ground from time to time.  Having regard to this consideration, the Division Bench affirmed the order of the learned Single  Judge. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and that the litigation is going on from a very long time and the respondent is almost on the verge of retirement,   we are not inclined to interfere in this appeal.  However, we modify the order of the Division -3- Bench to the extent that the respondent will not get the benefit of payment of 50% backwages from the date of filing of the writ petition as this misery has been invited by respondent himself. Be that as it may, we are not interfering in this appeal, but we modify the order of the Division Bench to the extent that the punishment recorded by the learned Single Judge and affirmed by the Division Bench of the stoppage of six grade increments with future effect is maintained but he will not be entitled to any http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 benefit of backwages whatsoever.  This is because of the fact that the incumbent is almost reaching at the age of superannuation.  Therefore, looking to these facts, we affirm the order of the Division Bench with the modification that he will not be entitled to any benefit of backwages.  However, this will not affect the retiral benefits of the respondent. The appeal is accordingly, disposed of. The stay order passed by this Court on 11th May, 2006 is vacated.","This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11th November, 2005 in D.B.Civil Special Appeal (W) No. 290 of 2003.

" JUDGMENT 2000 (3) SCR 946 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The respondent imported a diesel engine set. The invoice thereof showed the price of Rs. 8,50,740 for the said set along with standard spares and accessories. The Customs Department assessed the said set for the purposes of additional duty of Customs under T.I. 68 of the Central Excise Tariff and, accordingly, charged additional duty at the rate of 8 per cent ad valorem. The respondent filed a refund claim. It state mat the said set comprised of a diesel engine and an alternator. It provided the break up of the price of the said set, namely, Rs. 5,95,540 for the diesel engine and Rs. 2,55,200 for the alternator. It claimed that the additional duty should have been charged separately on each of the two components of the said set and the benefit of exemption notifications in this regard should have been given. The refund claim was rejected by the Assistant Collector of Customs. The respondent’s appeal to the Collector of Customs (Appeals) failed. The respondent carried the matter to the Tribunal. The Tribunal applied Section 19 of the Customs Act and came to the conclusion that the two main components of the said set, namely, the diesel engine and the generator, should have been separately assessed to additional duty and the benefit of the applicable exemption notifications given. Against the order of the Tribunal, the Customs authorities have preferred this appeal. In the first place, Section 19 of the Customs Act is inapplicable to the assessment of additional duty under the Customs Tariff Act. Section 19 applies to ""duty"" that is, ""duty under the Customs Act"", as is clear from Section 2(15) of the Customs Act. The method of determination of Customs duty thereunder where goods consist of articles liable to different rates of Customs duty is not applicable for the purposes of assessment of additional duty under the Customs Tariff Act. As is clear from the order of the Tribunal, what respondent had imported was the said set. That was what the invoice referred to and it gave the price for it. That the said set comprised of a diesel engine and an alternator was of no consequence for the purposes of assessment of additional duty. There is no dispute that for the purposes of such assessment of the said set, Tariff Item 68 was applicable. We think, in the circumstances, that the appeal should be allowed and the order of the Tribunal set aside. The order of the authorities below shall regulate the assessment of additional duty on the said set. Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.",The Customs Department assessed the said set for the purposes of additional duty of Customs under T.I. 68 of the Central Excise Tariff.

" JUDGMENT The following Order of the Court was delivered : O R D E R 1. These Appeals have been filed against the judgment of the Orissa High Court dated 08th October, 2004 passed in Writ Petition Nos.7230 of 2003 and 2551 of 2003. 2. The facts of the case are mentioned in the impugned judgment of the High Court in great detail and we need not refer to the same except where necessary. 3. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 4. It appears that there was an agreement to sell in favour of respondent No.1 herein-Jagdish Rai Puri and for specific performance of the same, a suit was filed which was decreed by the High Court in First Appeal No.348 of 1984 on 30.08.1994. In that judgment, it was mentioned that the plaintiff’s suit for specific performance of contract of sale is decreed and for executing the sale deed, defendant will seek permission from the State Government, as such permission was required as it was a government land. The land had been granted to the respondent No.2 herein who entered into an agreement to sell the land to respondent no.1 in these appeals. 5. From a perusal of the record, it appears that the said permission was refused by the State Government by its order dated 23.5.2003. Against that order, a writ petition was filed which has been decided by the impugned judgment. 6. We have carefully perused the impugned judgment of the High Court. While agreeing with the High Court that the order dated 23.5.2003 refusing permission was unsustainable, we are of the opinion that the High Court should not have directed the State Government to grant the necessary permission for transfer of the said land in favour of the appellant and should not have directed the opposite party No.1 in the said writ petition to have executed the deed of transfer in favour of the appellant. Instead, the High Court should have remitted the matter to the State Government for deciding the application seeking permission to transfer the said land afresh on relevant considerations. 7. Recently, in Civil Appeal Nos.6387-6390 of 2002 decided on 20th November, 2008 titled Union of India & Another vs. Bilash Chand Jain & Another, this Court held that the High Court cannot itself perform the functions which are to be performed by some other authority. If that authority passed an order which the High Court finds is not sustainable in law, the High Court can set aside the said order and remit the matter to the concerned authority for deciding the same afresh in accordance with law, but the High Court should not take over the function of the authority http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 itself. 8. We reiterate the views given in the aforesaid decision which has referred to the earlier decisions of this Court on the point. 9. Accordingly, we allow these appeals and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court to the extent indicated above and remit the matter to the State Government which shall decide the application seeking permission to transfer the said land afresh in accordance with law within two months from the date of communication of this order after hearing the parties concerned. No order as to costs. Civil Appeal No.3836/2005 10. In view of our decision passed today in Civil Appeal Nos.7934-7935 of 2004, as admitted by the learned counsel for respondent No.3 (appellant in Civil Appeal Nos.7934-7935/2004), the direction of the High Court no longer survives and this appeal has become infructuous. 11. Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed as having become infructuous.","Appeals have been filed against the judgment of the Orissa High Court dated 08th October, 2004 passed in Writ Petition Nos.7230 of 2003 and 2551 of 2003.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 24398 of 2004 ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment and order dated 7.2.2003 in Civil Revision No.144/2003 and the order dated 23.4.2004 in (Review Application) Misc. Civil No. 574/2004, passed by a learned Single Judge of Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur. Though various points were urged in support of the appeal, the primary stand was that Civil Revision filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the ’CPC’) was allowed by the learned Single Judge even without issuing notice to the appellant. On knowing the order passed by learned Single Judge in the Civil Revision, the review application was filed specifically pointing out that no notice had been issued before disposal of the Civil Revision. The High Court rejected the same as noted above. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in the review petition it was categorically mentioned that without notice the order dated 7.2.2003 was passed. There is no finding recorded that any notice was in fact issued. Unfortunately, the High Court did not consider this aspect and dismissed the review application. It is also submitted that the revision was not maintainable. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that though it may be a fact that notice was not issued before disposal of the Civil Revision yet the orders do not warrant any interference as a right position in law has been noted. The order of the High Court reads as follows: "" xxx           xxx                     xxx The trial Court has obviously mis- interpreted the provisions in Order VII Rule 11(d) C.P.C. Under this rule the plaint can be rejected where the suit ""appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law"". That is riot the situation here. The plaintiff has filed the suit for declaration of title and injunction and that can always be decided by the civil court irrespective of the decision of the revenue court under Section 250 of the M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1959. The revision is allowed\005."". http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A perusal of the order itself shows that only the applicant’s advocate was heard. There is also even no mention that any notice was issued to the present appellant and/or it was served. An adjudication adverse to him was done by disposal of Civil Revision without even issuance of notice before such adverse adjudication. It is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice. Natural justice is an inseparable ingredient of fairness and reasonableness.  It is even said that the principles of natural justice must be read into unoccupied interstices of the statute, unless there is a clear mandate to the contrary. In the celebrated case of Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works, 1963 (143) ER 414, the principle was thus stated: ""Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was called upon to make his defence. ’Adam’, says God, ’where art thou’ has thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that ’thou should not eat’."" Since then the principle has been chiselled, honed and refined, enriching its content.  In Mullooh v. Aberdeen 1971 (2) All E.R. 1278, it was stated : ""the right of a man to be heard in his defence is the most elementary protection."" Natural justice is the essence of fair adjudication, deeply rooted in tradition and conscience, to be ranked as fundamental. The purpose of following the principles of natural justice is the prevention of miscarriage of justice. On that score alone, the appeal deserves to be allowed.

We have heard Mr. A.R. Madhav Rao, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. K. Radhakrishna, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent.  We have perused the orders passed by the lower Authorities and also of the Tribunal. The point raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is covered by the recent judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No.4488 of 2005, Commissioner of Central Excise, Bangalore versus M/s. Mysore Electricals Industries Ltd., reported in 2007 (204) E.L.T. 517.  In the said Judgment, this Court held that a beneficial circular has to be applied retrospectively while oppresive circular has to be applied prospectively.  Thus, when the circular is against the assessee, they have right to claim enforcement of the same prospectively. In view of the submission made by the learned counsel for the appellant and also of the judgment of this Court in C.A.

" JUDGMENT ORDER Criminal Appeal No. 1608 of 2007 @ SLP (Crl.) No. 3433 of 2007. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. We have perused the impugned order dated 24th May, 2007 granting anticipatory bail passed by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Crl. Misc. No. 33867-M of 2007. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that no inteference is called for by this Court. The appeal is accordingly, dismissed. However, we make it clear that in case the respondents do not cooperate with the investigation, then it is always open for the State to move an application before the High Court for cancellation of the bail, which will be decided in accordance with law. It may be mentioned here that Section 438(2)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is very clear that while granting anticipatory bail the Court can lay down a condition that the accused shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required. The purpose of such a provision is that anticipatory bail cannot be permitted to be abused. It is therefore, implicit that whenever the Court imposes such a condition in its order, and the accused called for interrogation or for certain investigation does not appear before the investigating officer then it will be open for the State to move the High Court for cancellation of bail. We make it clear that this order is confined only to the F.I.R. in the present case. Criminal Appeal No. 1607/2007 @ SLP (Crl.) No. 3514/2007. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. This appeal by special leave is directed against the orders dated 15.5.2007 and 31.5.2007 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Crl. Misc. No. 27116-M of 2007 and CRM No. 36313 of 2007 whereby a contempt notice was issued to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Vigilance Bureau, Ludhiana who has sworn the affidavit along with the application. Normally the Courts should not be oversensitive and should not take very serious note of any loose expressions in the application. Contempt jurisdiction is to be sparingly exercise in very exceptional cases, as one of us (Markandey Katju, J.) has observed in an article http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ‘Contempt of Court: The Need for a Fresh Look’ published in the Journal Section of A.I.R. 2007 (March Part), and we agree with the views expressed therein. However, the applicant should use proper language and state correct facts in his application. Although it is not contempt, proper decorum should be maintained. Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that the learned Judge should not have issued contempt notice in the matter. The S.S.P. had sworn the affidavit but the counsel who has prepared the application should have been more careful while drafting such an application. They should not make incorrect statements. The language used by them should be in consonance with the dignity of the Court. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not think it to be a proper case where contempt notice ought to have been issued. In the facts and circumstances of the case, while maintaining the order dated 15.5.2007 we set aside the direction in the last paragraph of the learned Single Judge’s Order dated 31st May, 2007 issuing notice to the S.S.P., Vigilance Bureau, Ludhiana. The appeal is accordingly, disposed of.","We are of the opinion that no inteference is called for by this Court. The appeal is accordingly, dismissed.

This appeal is directed against a final order dated 8th of December, 2005 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court at Allahabad in First Appeal No. 306 of 2002, by which the Division Bench of the High Court had declined to interfere with the findings of the trial Court and dismissed the appeal. 3.      We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the impugned order, we are of the view that the impugned order cannot be sustained as it appears to us that the Division Bench, while deciding the appeal, has not at all applied its mind nor has considered the points raised by the parties before it.  The Division Bench, while dismissing the appeal, had made the following order :- \023Sri Alok Kumar Singh submitted that although nine issues were framed but the same were decided in 33 lines only, therefore, the judgment is bad.  However, we have perused the judgment and found that there is nothing bad in the judgment . In view of above, the appeal lacks merit and is, therefore, dismissed.\024 4.      A perusal of this order would show that the Division Bench, without going into the merits of the appeal and without applying its mind, had dismissed the appeal only by saying that on perusal, it was found that there was nothing bad in the judgment.  In our view, since the appeal was a first appeal i.e. the appeal had to be decided not only on law but also on facts, it was the duty of the Division Bench to apply its mind and decide the same in accordance with law after passing a speaking and reasoned order. 5.      For the reasons aforesaid, we are unable to sustain the order of the Division Bench and accordingly, set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and send it back to the High Court for a fresh decision in accordance with law after giving hearing to the parties.  It is expected that the High Court shall decide the appeal within two months from the date of communication of this order to the High Court.  No unnecessary adjournments shall be granted to either of the parties. 6.

It is to be noted that the co-accussed persons were acquitted of all the charges as evidence was not sufficient to substantiate the accusation. Additionally burden has been put on the accused-appellant to show as to under what circumstances the death was caused. The presumption in such matters is relateable to a death occuring within seven years of marriage. Admittedly, the marriage in the present case was solemnised more than 10 years before the date of occurrence.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. The 5th  respondent, K.R.  Ramanandan, was  selected by direct  recruitment  in  the  year  1977  for  selection  as Assistant Executive Engineer. All the direct recruits except the respondent  were appointed  in the  year  1978.  It  was admitted that  when he had filed O.P. No.7226/85 in the CAT, Ernakulam Bench,  by order  dated 31.1.1990 it was held that his appointment was delayed due to laches on the part of the Railway Administration.  After his  appointment in  the year 1981, within two years he passed his test. When his case was not considered for promotion as Executive Engineer, he filed the  O.A.   The  Tribunal  without  deciding  the  inter  se seniority in  the cadre  of Asstt.  Executive Engineers  had directed the Railway Administration to consider his case for promotion as Executive Engineer for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 and  if found fit for promotion in any of the posts, to give him  promotion for that year and to fix seniority among Executive  Engineers   accordingly.  Pursuant  thereto,  the respondent  was   considered  and   promoted  as   Executive Engineer. After the above order came to be made, the Railway Administration did  not carry  the matter  in appeal to this Court. Some  of the  persons seemingly aggrieved against the direction admittedly  filed a review petition which was also dismissed and  that  order  became  final.  The  petitioners thereafter challenged the self same order by filing separate O.A. and in the impugned order of the Tribunal dated October 19, 1995  the Tribunal  has confirmed it earlier order. Thus this Special Leave Petition. It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the petitioners that  since the  inter-re  seniority  as  Asstt. Engineers was  left open  in the order, the directions given by the  Tribunal to  consider the case as Executive Engineer and determine  his seniority  on the basis of the promotion, is not  valid in  law. We  find no  force in the contention. Once he is found to be eligible according to the rules, then http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 his seniority  is required  to  be  determined  as  per  the procedure prescribed  in the  rules in  vogue. It is further contended that  the fifth respondent was not qualified since he had not completed 8 years of required service. The Tribunal has  recorded a  finding that  two years  period is relaxable in  the case of the reserved candidates. The inter se seniority  as Asstt. Executive Engineer is required to be determined; he joined service in 1981 and, therefore, he did not have  the requisite  service. We  find no  force in  the contention. Since  he was selected by direct recruitment, he is  entitled   to  be   appointed  according  to  rule.  His appointment was  delayed for  no fault of him and he came to be appointed  in 1981,  he is,  therefore, entitled  to  the ranking given  in  the  select  list  and  appointment  made accordingly. Under  these circumstances,  we do not find any illegality in the order. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","The 5th respondent, K.R.

" CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Misc. Petition No. 1398 of 1962. Appeal against the order of the Deputy Registrar dated March 28, 1962 in Civil Appeals Nos. 41 to 49 of 1962.

April 5. The Order of the court was delivered by SARKAR J. -This is an appeal against the order of the Deputy Registrar  directing  the present case to be  registered  as nine appeals and requiring the appellant to pay nine sets of court-fees.  The Deputy Registrar had relied on two cases of this  Court,  namely,  Lajwanti Sial’s  case  (Petition  for Special  Leave No. 673 of 1959) and Kishinchand  Chellaram’s http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 case  (Civil  Appeals No. 462 to 465 of 1960).   We  do  not think that these precedents cover the present case. In Lajwanti’s Case there were a number of applications under s.  66 (2) of the Income-tax Act for reference of  the  same question.    There  were  in  tact  a  number  of   separate references but they were 887 dealt  with  by one judgment from which the appeal  to  this Court arose.  That was really a case of five appeals for the common judgment must be taken to have been delivered in each of the different reference cases. Kishinchand  Chellaram’8  case is also not  helpful  because there four applications by four different assessees had been made  for reference of three identical questions arising  in each assessment case under s. 66 (1) of the Income-tax  Act. Though  it appears that there was one order of reference  to the  High  Court and the High Court treated the  case  as  a single  case of reference, it could be said that there  were in fact a number of references. The  present  case however originated out  of  one  petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the  validity of  various  assessment orders.  Obviously here,  there  was only  one proceeding.  It could not be said that there  were as many proceedings as there were assessment orders for  the petitioner  had  by  a single petition  callenged  them  all together.   When an appeal is taken to this Court  from  the judgment  of  the  High  Court in such  a  petition,  it  is impossible to contend that there are more appeals than  one. Therefore, the appellant before us is liable only to pay one set  of court-fee and other charges as in a  single  appeal. Action may be taken accordingly by the office, if necessary, by refunding the excess charges made. 888","Appeal against the order of the Deputy Registrar dated March 28, 1962 in Civil Appeals Nos. 41 to 49 of 1962.

This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order dated February 10, 1995 of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir  in LPA  No.77 of  1990. The  admitted position is that  while   the  respondent   NO.5,  P.N.  Jalla,  was  on deputation as  senior Steno,  the appellant was appointed on regular basis  as Office  Superintendent. For  the  post  of Public Relations  Officer, he  is required  to be considered for promotion  on regular basis. Instead of promoting him on regular  basis,   the  deputation   is  was  considered  and promoted. The appellant challenged the said action by way of writ petition  which was  not  properly  considered  be  the Division Bench.  When the matter had come up for. admission, this Court  on August  21, 1995  had  passed  the  following order; ""Counsel for  the  petitioner  says that  the   petitioner   does   not require payment  of back-wages  but his  due   seniority   is   to   be considered according  to rules. The 3rd respondent  was only  a  senior stenographer from Govt. service and was  on   deputation.   While   the petitioner is  a  regular  employee and is  entitled to  be considered, when   the    vacancy   of   Public Relations Officer  had  arisen,  he was not considered, Since he Single Judge  has   given  the   direction correctly, the  Division Bench  was not right  in upsetting  that order from the  date on  which he was due to be  considered. In  view of  the fact that  he is  not claiming  any http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 arrears and  the 5th respondent has retired  from  service,  notice  is issued to  the State  as to why the petitioner’s seniority  should  not be taken  from the  date  when  the vacancy as P.R.O. had arisen and he was due  for consideration  but was not considered  along with  the 5th respondent"". Counter-affidavit has  been  filed  by  the  respondent contending that  appellant’s seniority  was considered  with effect from  the date  when the vacancy had arisen after the retirement of  the  5th  respondent.  The  above  action  is obviously illegal  and an  arm twist  to nepotism.  When the appellant was  a regular candidate as Office Superintendent, he was  entitled to  be  considered  in  preference  to  the deputationist, who is not a member of the service as on that date. He  was wrongly  denied of  his legitimate right to be considered  for   appointment  on  the  date  when  the  5th respondent was  appointed. It  is, therefore,  directed that the appellant  must be  considered to  have  been  regularly appointed with  effect  from  the  date  on  which  the  5th respondent was  promoted as P.R.O. and in terms of the order passed by  this Court.

The area  committee on  December 7,  1974, passed resolution after  considering the representation made by the Ist respondent  to give  15 days  time for compliance of the notice dated  March 27,  1973 and  September 13, 1974 and in case he does not comply with the same it further resolved to have the  structure demolished  through the  agency  of  the Board. Calling  this action  in question  the respondent had filed the  above  writ  petition  in  the  High  Court.  The Division Bench  has held  that though  Section 185 read with 5th  Schedule   does  not   contemplate  any  enquiry  being conducted or  reasons to  be recorded, principles of natural justice require  that necessary  notice and  opportunity  of hearing  be   given   and   after   consideration   of   the representation speaking  order is  required  to  be  passed. Since the  speaking order  had not been passed the action of the respondent was in violation of the law. The only  question in  this case  is whether  the  view taken by  the High Court is good in law. It is seen that the respondent in  his reply had admitted that they constructed, as pointed  out by  the Cantonment Board in its notice dated September 13,  1974, and  the previous notice. But he stated http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that he  had done  it bona fide and as he would not demolish it but  requested the authority to reconsider the matter and withdraw the notice. In other words, he admitted that he had carried on illegal construction without compliance with law. So the  question  is  whether  enquiry  in  that  behalf  is required to be conducted. We are of the considered view that the High  Court was  not right  in its  conclusion  that  an independent enquiry requires to be held after the notice was issued and the reply thereof was given by the respondent. It is seen that the Cantonment Board is an elected body represented by people themselves. When opportunity was given putting on  notice  of  illegal  construction  made  by  the respondent,  reply   thereof  was   given.  The   Board  had considered the representation and was not inclined to accede to the  request made  by the  respondent.  Accordingly,  the resolution passed  by the Cantonment Board cannot be faulted as violative of the principles of natural justice. However, Shri  Lekhi, learned counsel appearing for the appellants stated  that the  action taken  by the respondent can be  candoned provided  he complies with the law. In view of the  stand taken  by the  appellants, it would be open to the respondent  to make  a representation to the Board which would forward  the same  to General  Officer  Commanding  in Chief at Sagar who would pass an appropriate order according to law. The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed.   No   costs.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Misc.

Mohan  and Mrs. Geetanjali Mohan for the Petitioner. K.G. Bhagat, Additional Solicitor General, R.D. Agarwal and R.N. Poddar for the Respondent.

By an order dated December 2, 1983, this court  while dismissing a petition for special leave to appeal filed http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 439 against an  order of  the Delhi High Court refusing to grant bail to  the petitioner  until  after  examination  of  Rani Chaudhary as  a  witness,  gave  a  direction  that  on  the commencement of  the trial,  it should  proceed from day-to- day. Alleging  that his  two Advocates  are not  prepared to appear in the case from day-to-day as the trial is likely to be  prolonged,   the  petitioner   has  filed,  the  present application for  modification of  the earlier  order of this court by the deletion of the direction that the trial should proceed from day-to-day. We think  it is  an entirely wholesome practice for the trial to  go on  from day-to-day.  It is must expedient that the trial  before the  court of a Session should proceed and be dealt with continuously from its inception to its finish. Not only  will it  result in expedition, it will also result in the  elimination of manoeuvre and mischief. It will be in the interest  of both  the prosecution  and the defence that the trial  proceeds from  day-to-day.  It  is  necessary  to realise that  Sessions cases  must not  be tried  piecemeal. Before commencing  a trial,  a Sessions  Judge must  satisfy himself that  all necessary  evidence is available, If it is not, he  may postpone  the case,  but only  on the strongest possible ground  and for  the shortest possible period. Once the trial  commences, he  should, except for a very pressing reason which makes an adjournment inevitable, proceed de die in diem until the trial is concluded. We are  unable to  appreciate the difficulty said to be experienced  by  the  petitioner.  It  is  stated  that  his Advocate is  finding it  difficult to  attend the court from day-to-day. It  is the  duty of  every Advocate, who accepts the brief  in a  criminal case to attend the trial from day- today. We  cannot over-stress  the duty  of the  Advocate to attend to  the trial  from day-to-day.  Having accepted  the brief, he  will be  committing a  breach of his professional duty, if  he so  fails to attend. The Criminal Miscellaneous Petition is, therefore, dismissed. H.S.K.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R This appeal is directed against the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Allahabad setting aside the interim order passed by the trial court under Order 39, Rule 1 of Code of Civil Procedure and confirmed by the First Appellate Court, but set aside by the High Court in writ jurisdiction. The Suit is of 1995 and the basic question that arises for consideration is whether the appellants were appointed by the Committee of Management, Balika Uchchatar Madhyamik Vidayalaya or not.  This is not the stage to go into the question whether they will be entitled to salary during this period or not as the first question has to be decided whether they were appointed by the Management in pursuance of the order or not.  Therefore, we do not think that these issues can be decided in these proceedings. However, we direct that the trial court should decide the suit within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of copy of this order.  This will resolve all controversies involved in this matter.  The Trial court may proceed with the matter and decide the same without being influenced by any observation made in any of the orders passed by the courts below.

" O R D E R This appeal  is directed  against the  judgment of  the Central Administrative  Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi dated 13.11.1992. By the impugned judgment, the Tribunal had called upon  the appellants  to consider  the  case  of  the respondents, who  admittedly possessed  the qualification of Vaidya Visharad  from Hindi  Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad for the post  of Pharmacist after relaxing the qualification and experience for the post whenever any future vacancy arises. Mrs. Amreshwari,  the learned  senior counsel  for  the appellants contends  that a  Vaidya Visharad  recognised  by Hindi  Sahitya   Sammelan  is  not  one  of  the  recognised qualifications for  the post  of Pharmacist  and the minimum qualification for  a post  cannot be relaxed and, therefore, Tribunal was  in error  in directing to consider the case of the  respondents  on  relaxation  of  the  qualification  in question. Learned  counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, contended  that the  degree of Vaidya Visharad awarded by  Hindi   Sahitya  Sammelan,   Allahabad   is   recognised qualification under  the Central  Government  Health  Scheme Delhi (Group  C) Ayurvedic, Recruitment Rules, 1978. In view of the  rival stand  taken by the parties, the only question that arises  for consideration  is  whether  the  degree  of Vaidya  Visharad   awarded     by  Hindi  Sahitya  Sammelan, Allahabad can  be held  to be  a recognised    qualification under  the   Recruitment  Rules.  Looking  to  the  Schedule attached to the Rules which prescribed the qualification, it is apparent that it is ‘Vaidya Visharad’ which is awarded by All India  Ayurvedic Congress  is recognised  and it is only Ayurved Ratna  which is  awarded by  Hindi Sahitya  Sammelan which   is  recognised.  Therefore,  the  degree  of  Vaidya Visharad  awarded   by  Hindi  Sahitya  Sammelan,  which  is possessed  by  the  respondents  cannot  be  held  to  be  a recognised qualification under the Recruitment Rules. It may be stated  that in  the application before the Tribunal, the respondents have  categorically asserted that they possessed the qualification  of Vaidya  Visharad recognised  by  Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.  In that  view of the matter, the Tribunal was wholly  in error  in directing consideration of the case of the  respondents in  case of  future vacancies  against a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 post of  Pharmacist. The  respondents  do  not  possess  the requisite qualification  under the  Recruitment Rules.  They cannot have  any right of appointment. The impugned judgment of the  Tribunal is  set aside.

" L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J J U D G M E N T RAJENDRA BABU, J.  : This  appeal  is filed against the orders made by  the High  Court  either  by the learned Single Judge or  by  the Division  Bench  of  the  High Court on  an  appeal  thereto declining  to interfere with an adjudication by the Tribunal under  the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 [hereinafter referred to as the Act] either by the learned Single  Judge or by the Division Bench of the High Court  on an appeal thereto.  Section 13-A of the Act provides that if any  question arises as to the application or interpretation of a standing order any employer or workman or a trade union or  other  representative  body  of workmen  may  refer  the question  to  any  one of the Labour Courts and  the  Labour Court to which such question is referred shall, after giving opportunity  to the parties, decide the same, which shall be final  and binding on the parties.  Standing Order 15(x)  of the  Certified  Standing  Order  of 1953  of  the  appellant provides  that taking intoxicants or noxious drugs while  on duty or being under their influence when reporting for duty, would  amount to misconduct entailing dismissal and Standing Order  15(b)  provides  that  no   order  of  dismissal   or suspension  for more than a week or of stoppage of increment shall  be made until an enquiry has been held to investigate the  circumstances of the case and to decide what offence or offences were committed.  The accused workman shall have the right  to  be  present  at the enquiry and  to  produce  any witness  in his defence.  Detailed and elaborate  provisions have  been made as to composition of the enquiry  committee, report  to  be  made and action to be  taken  thereon.   One Sushil  Kumar  Mukherjee  had been  dismissed  invoking  the aforesaid  provisions without holding an enquiry.   However, that  matter  became final as the Labour Court and the  High Court   dismissed   the  order   made  therein.   In   those circumstances,  an application was filed before the Tribunal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 under  the Act seeking interpretation as to the true  effect of  these provisions.  The contention put forth on behalf of the  appellant  is  that  there is  no  present  dispute  or controversy between the parties and that what led respondent No.1  to file his application is an apprehension in his mind that unless there is a proper interpretation of clause 15 of the  Certified  Standing  Order of 1953, the  management  is likely to victimise the workmen.  The Tribunal rejected this contention.   The  High Court held that the apprehension  of the  applicant-respondent No.1 cannot be stated to be as one purely   imaginary  not  based  on   facts  and  merely   an apprehension  in his mind.  His claim for interpretation  of clause  15  is  that  there was action  taken  invoking  the provisions  of clause 15 of the Certified Standing Order  of 1953 in a particular manner, correctness of which was put in issue  for  interpretation and that such a matter cannot  be stated  to  be one not covered by Section 13-A of  the  Act. The  view taken by the High Court, therefore, does not  call for  any interference.  The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO. 10668 OF 2006) Leave granted. Heard both sides. The respondent herein filed a civil suit alleging that she was not appointed by the State, though selected for the post of Mid-wife, while other candidates with lesser merit were appointed on 17.6.1986. The suit was decreed on 31.7.1997 declaring that the appellant was entitled to be appointed and directing the appellant State to consider her for appointment within a period of three months from the date of decree. The State went in appeal against the decree and that appeal was dismissed. The State filed a second appeal which was dismissed and the SLP filed by the State was also dismissed. Only thereafter, the respondent was appointed on 31.8.2000. The respondent filed a fresh suit claiming that she should have been appointed with effect from 17.6.1986 with all consequential benefits including salary and allowances. That suit was dismissed. The First Appellant Court, however, decreed the suit in part and declared that she was entitled to all monetary benefits, seniority and length of service with effect from 8.10.1991 (the date of filing the first suit). The High Court, by the impugned Judgment has affirmed the said decree. We find that in the first round of litigation, the only direction was to consider the respondent for appointment and appoint her within three months, that is on or before 31.10.1997. There was no direction to appoint the respondent with retrospective effect or to give monetary or other benefits from such retrospective date. That judgment attained finality. Therefore, the appointment had to be made prospectively, after the date of judgment dated 31.7.1997. Therefore, the direction given in the second round of litigation to make the appointment of respondent effective from 8.10.1991 cannot be sustained. As per the decree dated 31.7.1997 in the first round litigation, the respondent ought to have been appointed within three months from that date, that is 31.10.1997. But we find that on account of that decree being challenged, the respondent was appointed only on 31.8.2000. In the circumstances, the respondent was entitled to get the benefits of appointment including salary and allowances only from 1.11.1997, as per the decree dated 31.7.1997. In the result, we allow this appeal in part and modify the decree by substituting the effective date of appointment of respondent as 1.11.1997. Consequently, the State shall also pay salary and allowances to the respondent only from 1.11.1997 and not from 8.10.1991.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI, J. The State  has filed  t his appeal against the judgment of the  Punjab &  Haryana High  Court in Criminal Appeal No. 13/87. The High Court acquitted both the respondents for the offence punishable  under Section  302 read  with Section 34 IPC. Both the  respondents alongwith  two others  were tried for  causing   death  of  Rita,  Respondents  -  Gian  Kaur, Balvinder kaur,  Darshan lal  and Balbir were the mother-in- law, sister-in-law,  father-in-law and  husband respectively of Rita (deceased). The proesecution  case was that they were not satisfied with the  dowry given  to her  by her parents at the time of her marriage  and that had often led to quarrels between the accused  and   Rita  and   her  parents.  According  to  the prosecution, on  21.6.86 at  about 6.00  p.m., Gian Kaur and Balvinder Kaur sprinkled kerosene on her and thereafter Gian kaur set  her on  fire by  throwing a lighted match stick on her. It was further alleged that the mother-in-law wanted to get her  son re-married  and for that reason also she wanted to kill her. The  only   evidence  which   was  relied   on  by  the prosecution and  on the  basis  of  which  the  trial  court convicted  Gian  Kaur  and  Balvinder  kaur  was  the  dying declaration recorded by ASI-Darshan Singh - PW 5. The High Court disbelieved the dying declaration on the ground that  even thought  according to the medical evidence Rita had  100% burns  over her  body. The  High Court relied upon the  deposition of  Doctor Aneja, who had performed the post-mortem and who has categorically stated that there were 100% burns  over her  body and both  the thumbs of Rita were burnt. In view of such inconsistent evidence, the High Court was right  in giving benefit of doubt to the respondents. It cannot be said in this case that the High Court has taken an unreasonable view.

" O R D E R Leave granted. On January  11, 1996,  since  the  respondent  had  not appeared,  the  matter  was  heard  ex-parte.  However,  the appellant  was   directed  to  produce  copy  of  the  order dismissing the  respondent from  service. That order has now been placed  on record.  The  respondent  was  removed  from service by  the proceedings  of the  General Manager  of the appellant on  May 26,  1989. The  respondent filed  the Suit No.450/91 Questioning it for a declaration that the order of removal was  illegal.  The  trial  Court  proceeded  on  the finding that the order of removal is based upon the previous conduct of  the respondent which was not put in issue before he  was  removed  from  service.  Therefore,  the  order  is vitiated by  error of  law. That was upheld by the appellate Court. The  Second Appeal was dismissed summarily. Thus this appeal is by special leave. The order  of removal clearly indicates that the charge was framed  on the  basis that  he committed  misconduct  in collecting fares  from the passengers but had not issued the tickets  to   them.  Evidence   was  adduced   after  giving reasonable opportunity  and it was found that the defence of the respondent was not proved. As a consequence, it was held in paragraph  5 that  ""in view of foregoing discussions, the charge of  committing fraud  to  the  tune  of  Rs.7.50  ps. against Shri  Darshan Singh,  C. is established."" In view of that finding, the respondent was removed from service. While communicating the  order, they  have indicated  the previous punishments he  had to  his credit.  That does not mean that they have  taken into  account  those  previous  punishments imposed on  him. The  courts below,  therefore, have wrongly proceeded on  the assumption that the disciplinary authority had taken  into consideration  the previous  conduct without any  charge   being  framed   in  that  behalf  or  that  no opportunity was given to the respondent in this behalf.

This Court on 08.01.2008, while issuing notice, granted interim bail to the appellan t . Heard learned senior counsel for the parties. It is a settled law that where the sentence is less or up to three years, the Courts should ordinarily grant bail to the accused because in view of the long pendency of the cases in th e High Courts, a matter will come on Board after a long time and by that time the accused might have completed his sentence. By way of advice, we deem it fit to say that in a number of similar orders passed by the same learned Judge refusing to grant bail in the cases where the maximum sentence is three years, this Court has interfered earlier also and granted bail to the accused.  Keeping in v iew that this Court has interfered earlier also in such cases, this learned Judge should not pas s such orders as it entails undue hardship to the litigant who has to approach this Court for getting bail and thus increases the burden of this Court. In view of the above position, in our view, appellant deserves to be released on bai l during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court.

The  appellant  No.l on coming to know of it approached  the Deputy  Collector and the competent authority with a request to  re-open  the  proceedings  on   the  ground  that  while determining  excess  ^and, the competent authority  had  not taken  into  consideration share of his sister in the  joint family property.  The competent authority refused to re-open the  case and therefore the appellants were required to file Writ Petition. The  challenge  to the constitutional validity of  the relevant   provisions  of  the   Urban  Land  (Ceiling   and Regulation)  Act  has  to be rejected as  Its  validity  has already  been upheld by this court.  (See Maharao Saheb Shri Bhim  Singhji etc.  vs.  UOI and ors :  AIR 1981 SC 234  and AIR  1985 SC 1G50 ).  Moreover, the contention raised by the appellants  that as no provision has been made in the  Urban Land  (Ceiling  and  Regulation) Act  regarding  payment  of compensation  at market rate for acquisition of agricultural land,  it  is  violative of the second  proviso  to  Article 31-A(1)  of the Constitution, is thoroughly misconceived  as http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 what  is taken over by the State is the excess vacant  land. The challenge to the order passed by the competent authority 1s   also   without  substance.   No  appeal   or   revision application was filed against it and therefore it had become final   and   binding   on   the  appellants.    After   the determination  of  the  excess land,  a  notification  under Section  10(1)  of  the Act was issued and the  excess  land vested  in  the State Government under Section 10(3) of  the Act.   Ten  years thereafter, the appellants had  filed  the Writ  Petition  challenging the said order.  The High  Court was,  therefore,  justified in dismissing the Writ  Petition summarily.  It 1s also  worth noting that even though the sister of  the appellants knew about the proceedings, she had not filed any objection  at any stage before the land vested in the  State Government.   She  filed a Writ Petition in 1986 and it  was dismissed. As  we do not find any substance in this appeal, it is dismissed. No order as to costs.","This appear arises out of the order passed by the High Court  of judicature at Bombay In Writ Petition No.  994/93. The High Court summarily dismissed the Writ Petition.

" ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Transfer Petition (Criminal) No.  40 of 1977. Under Section 406 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. D. P. Bhandare and N. S. Das Bahl for the Petitioners. V.P. Rama, Adv.  Genl.  Tamil Nadu and A. V. Rangam for the Respondents. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.-The Code of Criminal Procedure clothes this Court  with power under s. 406 lo transfer a case or  appeal from one High Court or a Court subordinate to one High Court to  another  High Court or to a Court  subordinate  thereto. But it does not clothe this Court with the power to transfer investigations  from  one police station to another  in  the country  simply  because the first information or  a  remand report  is forwarded to a Court.  The application before  us stems  from  a  misconception about the scope  of,  S.  406. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 There is as yet no case pending before any Court as has been made  clear in the counter affidavit of the State  of  Tamil Nadu.   In the light of this counter affidavit, nothing  can be done except to dismiss this petition. If the petitioners are being directed to appeal in a far-off Court during investigatory stage it is for them to move that Court  for  appropriate  orders  so that  they  may  not  be tormented  by  long travel or otherwise teased  by  judicial process.  If justice is denied there are 605 other redresses, not under s. 406, though it is  unfortunate that  the petitioners have not chosen to move that court  to be  absolved  from  appearance  until  necessitated  by  the circumstances or the progress of the investigation.  To come to  this  Court  directly seeking an order  of  transfer  is travelling along the wrong street.  We are sure that if  the second  petitioner  is ailing, as is represented,  and  this fact  is  brought  to  the notice of  the  Court  which  has directed her appearance, just orders will be passed in  case there is veracity behind the representation. We need  hardly say  courts  should use their processes to  the  purpose  of advancing justice, not to harass parties. Anyway, so far  as thepetition for transfer is concerned, to borrow a cliche, the less said the better and so we dismiss it. S. R.

Jain, R.P.Singh and Y.D.Chandrachud for the Appellant. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 U.S. Prasad for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. Special leave granted. The  order dated 25th March, 1988 of the  Collector  is under challenge in this appeal. The same reads as follows: ""Shri Raghu Nath Thakur S/o Late Gorakh Thakur, Village Repura,  P.S.  Puksha,  District  Samastipur  had  bid   for Rs.11,900 (Rupees eleven thousands only) per month Dak in an auction  of Beni Country liquor shop held on 27.3.88 and  he as  given the shop of Beni Country liquor but after  signing in Bandobasti Register he did not deposit dak amount. The name of Shri Raghu Nath Thakur S/o Late Gorakh Nath Village  Repura, P.S. Pusa, Distt. Samastipur  is  therefore placed in the black list for future under the orders  passed by the Collector, Samastipur."" This  order  was passed pursuant to the  order  of  the Collector.  The  letter dated 25th March,  1988,  states  as follows: ""The  Collector  of the district after perusal  of  the said  office note passed order on 25.3.88 which is  produced in verbatim below: Ist bidder chunki defaulter hai atah security prapt kar len tatha bhavishya ke liae Black list karen. "" Indisputably, no notice had been given to the appellant of  the  proposal  of black-listing the  appellant.  It  was contended  on behalf of the State Government that there  was no requirement in the rule of giving any prior notice before black-listing  any person. In so far as the contention  that there is no requirement specifically of giving any notice is concerned,  the  respondent is right. But it is  an  implied principle  of  the rule of law that any order  having  civil consequence  should  be  passed  only  after  following  the PG NO 869 principles  of natural justice. It has to be  realised  that black-listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil  consequence  for the future business  of  the  person concerned in any event. Even if the rules do not express so, it  is  an  elementary principle  of  natural  justice  that parties  affected  by any order should have right  of  being heard and making representations against the order. In  that view of the matter, the last portion of the order in so  far as  it directs black-listing of the appellant in respect  of future  contracts,  cannot  be  sustained  in  law.  In  the premises,  that  portion  of the order  directing  that  the appellant  be placed in the black-list in respect of  future contracts  under the Collector is set aside. So far  as  the cancellation of the bid of the appellant is concerned,  that is  not affected. This order will, however, not prevent  the State Government or the appropriate authorities from  taking any  future  steps  for blacklisting the  appellant  if  the Government  is so entitled to do so in accordance with  law, i.e.  giving the appellant due notice and an opportunity  of making  representation.  After hearing  the  appellant,  the State  Government  will be at liberty to pass any  order  in accordance  with  law indicating the reasons  therefor.  We, however, make it quite clear that we are not expressing  any opinion  on the correctness or otherwise of the  allegations made against the appellant. The appeal is thus disposed of. S . K .

" O R D E R Leave granted. The  proceedings   were  initiated  under  the  Gujarat Agricultural Lands  Ceiling Act, 1960 [for short, ""the Act""] to determine  the ceiling  area and  the surplus  area.  The respondent claimed that under an agreement dated October 14, 1969, thirty acres of land had been transferred in favour of the  respondent’s   mother  which  was  duly  recognised  by mutation  proceedings   dated  15.9.1971.  The  question  is whether it  is to  defeat the  provisions of  the Act.  Sub- section (1) of Section 8 of the Act reads thus : ""8. Transfere  or partitions  made after 15th    January    1959    but    before commencement of  this Act.  - (1)  Where after 15th  day  of  January,  1959  but before the  commencement of  this Act or after 24th  day of  January,  1971,  but before the  specified date,  any  person has transferred  whether by  sale, gift, mortgage,  with   possession,   exchange lease,   surrender   or   otherwise   or partitioned any  land held  by him, then notwithstanding  anything  contained  in any law for the time being in force such transfer or  partition shall,  unless it is proved  to the contrary, be deemed to have been  made in anticipation in order to defeat  the object of this Act.

The question is  whether this agreement is a transfer. Shri R.P. Bhatt, learned  senior counsel appearing for the respondent, has taken  us through  the agreement  which had specifically stated that  right, title  and  interest  of  the  land  was conferred for  the first  time in  favour of  the respondent under that  document. Thereby, the right, title and interest held by  the owner of the land is sought to be extinguished. In turn  it is  sought to  be conferred  in  favour  of  the respondent  for  the  first  time  under  the  document.  By operation of  Section 17  of the  Registration Act,  it is a compulsorily registerable  document. Since  it has  not been registered, the  owner has  not been  divested of the right, title and  interest in the land and thus continued to be the owner of the land under the Act. The  authorities   and  the   High   Court   have   not appropriately  considered   this  question.  The  appeal  is allowed accordingly  and  the  matter  is  remitted  to  the ceiling authority  to compute  the ceiling  area keeping  in view what has been held in this order. The authorities would take further action according to law.

" O R D E R Counsel for the appellant states that the office report dated July 16, 1996 has been complied with. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  High Court  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  Shimla  made  in M.F.A.No.24/80 on May 5, 1984. The only question is: whether the-appellant is  a tenant  in occupation  of the  land?  He claimed that  he was  entitled to compensation in respect of subject matter of acquisition as tenant. The reference Court and the  High Court recorded as a fact that the appellant is not a tenant and, therefore, is not entitled to the share in the compensation  as a tenant. The undisputed facts are that 14  canals   18  marlas  of  land  belonged  to  the  family consisting of  Kishori Lal,  Kewal  Krishan  and  Koushalya, their  sister.   Kishori  Lal   and  Koushalya   sold  their respective suitable  shares. Kewal  Krishan  also  sold  his specified share  to the  appellant. It  would appear that in the revenue  records the  name of  the  appellant  has  been entered as  a qualifying  tenant by  reason of sale when the land to an extent of land admeasuring one canal, 5 marlas; 2 canals, 3  marlas belonged  to Vijay  Kumar were acquired by the Government.  The appellant  laid claim  as a  tenant  in respect  thereof.  The  courts  below  held  that  since  he purchased a  specified share from Kewal Krishan he cannot be considered to  be as  a tenant  in respect of in other lands and, therefore, is not entitled to the compensation. We find that the  view taken by the High Court is in conformity with law. Mutation  entries  do  not  confer  any  title  to  the property. It  is only  an entry  for collection  of the land revenue from  the person  in possession.  The title  to  the property should  be on  the basis of the title they acquired to the  land and  not by  mutation entries.  Admittedly, the appellant has purchased some lands from Kewal Krishan one of the brothers  of the  family to  the extent of his specified share. No  lease deed was executed it respect of otherlands. In these  circumstances, the  appellant cannot be treated to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 be a  tenant of  Vijay Kumar  to claim  compensation on  the basis of his title as a tenant. The Court  below is  directed to pay over the amount to Vijay Kumar and if the amount is withdrawn by the appellant, Bank-guarantee should  be encashed  and the  balance  amount would be  paid over  to the appellant. If the amount was not withdrawn the  bank guarantee  given  by  the  appellant  is directed to be discharged. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","Appellant claimed that he was entitled to compensation in respect of subject matter of acquisition as tenant.

Further direction was given to dispose it  of within  the specified  time with which we are not concerned.

The  direction given  by the appellate Court and confirmed by the High Court, therefore, is not in conformity with  the law  laid down  by this  Court.

The Government  has prescribed April 1, 1981 as the cut off date  for acquisition of the qualification and those who have acquired  the qualifications  prior to  that  date  are entitled to  the additional  amounts as prescribed under the Rules. The High Court has allowed the writ petitions without reference to  the relevant Rules. It is settled law that the cut  off   date  has   to  be  valid  and  bears  reasonable relationship to the object sought to be achieved. It is  stated that the teachers are relying upon Rule 9 of the  1974  Rules.  We  are  informed  that  several  writ petitions are pending in the High Court on the basis of Rule 9. In that view of this matter, it may be desirable that all these matters be decided by the High Court. Taking an  over all  view of all the facts, the appeals are allowed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2823 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.24406/2004) Leave granted.  Heard learned counsel for the appellant. 2.              The appellant claimed a compensation of Rs.5 lacs for injuries sustained by him in a motor accident on 9.8.1985, that is a collision between the motor cycle driven by him and a bus belonging to Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (for short ’KSRTC’). The Tribunal by its judgment dated 4.1.2003 held that there was contributory negligence on the part of the appellant and fixed the responsibility for the accident in the ratio of 50:5 0  on the driver of the bus and the appellant. It assessed the total compensation as Rs.2,32,254/- .  In view of the contributory negligence to an extent of 50%, it awarded a compensation of Rs.1,16,127/- with interest @ 8% per annum from the date of petition till the date of payment. -2- 3.              KSRTC, the owner of the bus challenged the said award by filing an appeal. The High Court allowed the appeal in part, and increased the liability of the appellant for the accident to 75% and reduced the liability of the bus driver to 25%.  Consequently, it arrive d at the compensation as Rs.58,063/- and rounded it off to Rs.60,000/-.  Feeling aggrieved, th e claimant-appellant is before us. 4.              We find that after detailed consideration of the evidence, the Tribunal held that both were liable and fixed the ratio of liability at 50% each.  On the other hand, the High Court has modified the ratio by increasing the liability of appellant at 75% without much justification.  On the facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the judgment of the Tribunal assessing the ratio of liability at 50:50 is proper and the High Court ought not to have interfered with it. 5.              We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the judgment and award of the Tribunal.","The appellant claimed a compensation of Rs.5 lacs for injuries sustained by him in a motor accident on 9.8. 1985.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard the  counsel on  both sides. Admittedly, the respondent  had filed O.A. No.1169/93 in the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal,  Bombay  Bench  against  the  order passed by  the Commissioner  of Police,  Bombay removing him from service. The Commissioner had exercised his power under Art.311(2)(b)  of  the  Constitution  holding  that  in  the circumstances it  was not  practicable to conduct an enquiry against the  respondent. That  order came to be confirmed by the Tribunal  dismissing the  O.A. on March 6, 1995. Against that, the  respondent filed  SLP (C)  No.11433/95 which  was dismissed by  this Court  on 25.8.95.  Pending the  SLP, the respondent filed  a review  application in the Tribunal. The Tribunal after  receipt of  the order  passed by  this Court dismissing the  SLP, by  the impugned  order  dated  2.11.95 reviewed the  order and  set aside  the order  of dismissal. Thus this appeal by special leave. It is  contended for  the respondent that the dismissal of the SLP does not preclude the Tribunal from reviewing the order since  the dismissal was a non-speaking order. We fail to appreciate  the contention  of the respondent. It is true that this  Court has  held that the dismissal of SLP without speaking  order   does  not  constitute  res  judicata.  The principle of  res judicata  is founded on public policy that the parties  cannot be  permitted to  have  the  controversy directly or  substantially in issue between the same parties or those  claiming under  the parties in the subsequent suit in the  same proceedings  in the subsequent stages cannot be raised once  over. It  is a sound principle of public policy to prevent vexation. But in  this case,  when the  self-same main  order was confirmed by  this Court,  the question  arises whether  the Tribunal has  had power  under Order  47, Rule  1 CPC or any other appropriate  provision  under  the  Tribunals  Act  to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 review the  orders passed  by it and confirmed by this Court by refusing to grant leave. We find that the exercise of the review power is deleterious to the judicial discipline. Once this Court  has confirmed  the order passed by the Tribunal, that becomes  final. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot have any power to  review the previous order which stands merged with the order passed by this Court. It is  next contended  by the  learned counsel  for the respondent that  though the  Tribunal was  communicated with the order  of this  Court dated  25.8.95, it  has thereafter passed the  order. It  would mean  that though  it  had  the knowledge of  dismissal of  the order  passed by this Court, the Tribunal  has exercised  the power  of review  and that, therefore, it  cannot be  said to  be illegal. We are wholly unable to  appreciate the contention of the learned counsel. We could appreciate that if the Tribunal had no knowledge of dismissal of  the SLP  it might,  in certain  circumstances, review its  earlier order,  e.g., if  it was  found that the order was  vitiated by any manifest error of law apparent on the  face   of  the   record.  But   having   received   the communication that  this Court has already upheld its order, the Tribunal’s exercise of power can be said to be audacious and   without   any   judicial   discipline.   Under   those circumstances, we donot think that the Tribunal is justified in reviewing its own order when this Court had confirmed the order passed earlier. The appeal  is accordingly allowed. The review order is set aside. But in the circumstances without costs.","The appeal is allowed. The review order is set aside without costs. O R D E R Leave granted.

" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. This Appeal is against a one paragraph Order dated 16th October, 2001 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which reads as follows: ""In the case notice was issued to the Respondent limited to rate of interest only in view of our decision in H.U.D.A. vs. Darsh Kumar, Revision Petition No. 1197/98, the Revision Petition is dismissed."" On 16th October 1995, the Respondents were allotted a Nursing Home site in Sector 23/23A, Urban Estate, Gurgaon for consideration of Rs.2,145/- per square yard.   On 22nd December, 2003 the Respondents were then offered an alternate site No. NH-1, Sector 46, Urban Estate, Gurgaon for consideration of Rs.3,606/- per square yard.  This was accepted by the Respondents without prejudice to their rights.  The Respondent then filed a complaint.  On these facts, the District Forum directed that the alternate site was to be given at the same rate as the original site.  The District Forum further ordered that the Appellants shall adjust the amount of Rs.1,82,625/-, deposited by the Respondents, towards future installments. The State Forum dismissed the Appeal and confirmed the Order of the District Forum.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission dismissed the Revision. As the Appellants did not comply with the Orders, an Execution Application was taken out.  By Order dated 22nd May, 2000 the Appellants were directed to comply with the Orders and were also directed to pay interest at 15% per annum on amounts deposited by the Respondent. Against the Order dated 22nd May, 2000, an Appeal was filed before the State Forum.  The Appeal was dismissed on 3rd November, 2000. Against the Order of 3rd November, 2000, a Revision was filed before the State Forum which has been dismissed by the impugned one paragraph Order. A perusal of the Order of the National Commission reveals that the National Commission had not realized that the Revision was against Orders passed in Execution Proceedings.  It does appear that the National Commission has mechanically and without application of mind passed the above mentioned one paragraph Order.  Thus the Order of the National Commission would normally require to be set http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 aside.  We however find that the Orders of the District Forum and State Forum in the Execution Application are correct and require no interference.   The Appellants had lost, in the earlier round, up to the National Commission.  That Order was not appealed against.  Thus that Order has become final.  The Order directing execution is in accordance with the earlier Orders. Accordingly, we dismiss this Appeal with no order as to costs.","This Appeal is against a one paragraph Order dated 16th October, 2001 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

" O R D E R What we say in this order shall not only cover the case of the  first respondent  but shall also regulate the system of recording  annual confidential  reports prevalent  in the U.P. Jal Nigam - the first petitioner herein. The first respondent was down graded at a certain point of time  to which  the Service  Tribunal gave  a correction. Before the  High Court,  the petitioners’ plea was that down grading entries  in confidential reports cannot be termed as adverse entries  so as  to obligate the Nigam to communicate the same  to the employee and attract a representation. This argument was  turned down  by the High Court, as in its view confidential reports,  were assets  of the  employee,  since they  weigh   to  his   advantage  at  the  promotional  and extensional stages of service. The High Court to justify its view  has   given  an   illustration  that  if  an  employee legitimately  had   earned  an  ’outstanding’  report  in  a particular year  which, in a succeeding one, and without his knowledge, is reduced to the level of ’satisfactory’ without any communication  to him, it would certainly be adverse and affect him at one or the other stage of his career. We need  to explain  these  observations  of  the  High Court. The  Nigam has  rules, whereunder an adverse entry is required to  be communicated  to the employee concerned, but not down grading of an entry. It has been urged on behalf of the Nigam that when the nature of the entry does not reflect any adverseness  that is not required to be communicated. As we view  it the extreme illustration given by the High Court may reflect  an adverse  element compulsorily  communicable, but if  the graded  entry is  of going  a  step  down,  like falling from  ’very good’  to ’good’ that may not ordinarily be an  adverse entry  since both are a positive grading. All what is required by the Authority recording confidentials in the situation  is to record reasons for such down grading on the personal  file of  the officer concerned, and inform him http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the  change in  the form  of an  advice. If the variation warranted be  not permissible,  then  the  very  purpose  of writing annual  confidential reports  would  be  frustrated. Having achieved  an optimum  level the  employee on his part may slacken  in his  work, relaxing  secure by  his one time achievement. This would be an undesirable situation. All the same the  sting of  adverseness must,  in all events, be not reflected in  such variations,  as otherwise  they shall  be communicated as  such. It  may be  emphasized  that  even  a positive confidential  entry in  a given case can previously be adverse and to say that an adverse entry should always be qualitatively damaging  may not be true. In the instant case we have  seen the service record of the first respondent. No reason for  the change  is mentioned.  The down  grading  is reflected  by   comparison.  This   cannot  sustain.  Having explained in  this manner  the case  of the first respondent and the  system that  should prevail in the Jal Nigam, we do not find  any difficulty  in accepting  the ultimate  result arrived at by the High Court. The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.","The High Court turned down the petitioners’ plea that down grading entries in confidential reports cannot be termed as adverse entries.

" O R D E R It was  mentioned in the order dated April 8, 1996 that in spite  of adjournment  of the  case  repeatedly,  counter affidavit has  not  been  filed.  Consequently,  this  Court directed the  respondents to appoint 18 teachers as required by the  petitioners within the specified time. It is now the admitted position  that eight  teachers selected by the U.P. Secondary Education  Service Commission  were appointed. One of them  had not  joined the  service.  Consequently,  seven persons  out  of  18  have  taken  charge.  Resultantly,  11 candidates were  not  recommended  for  appointment  by  the Commission. The petitioner-college appears have appointed 11 teachers. It  would be  obvious that these 11 teachers would be ad  hoc appointees  pending disposal of the writ petition and they would not and should not claim any right or equity whatsoever pursuant  to, the  said appointment.  Under  sub- section (3)  of Section  18 of  the U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission  and Selection Board Act, 1982 (Act 5 of 1982), appointment  of an  ad hoc teacher under sub-sections (1) and  (2) shall cease to have effect from the earliest of the dates mentioned therein, namely, (a) when the candidates recommended by  the Commission or Board, as the case may be, join the  post: (b)  when the post of one month preferred to under sub-section (4) of Section 11 express; or (c) 30th day of June  following the  day of  such ad  hoc appointment. In that view,  the ad  hoc appointments  though not  consistent with Section  5 of  the Ist  Removal of  Difficulties Order, 1981 and,  therefore, not  according to  rules, would remain operative  until  either  of  the  events  occur.  The  said arrangements of  ad hoc appointment, if the writ petition is disposed of  earlier, would  be subject to the result in the writ petition.  In other words, the ad hoc appointees should be replaced  by candidates  selected by  the Commission  and recommended for appointment in accordance with the said Act. The application is accordingly disposed of. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","Eight  teachers selected by the U.P. Secondary Education Service Commission were appointed.

" O R D E R This case  has been  called  even  after  the  list  is revised, but nobody appears. A perusal  of the  writ petition  shows that filling of this petition  is total  abuse of the process of this court. The petitioner,  whose services were terminated on 5.1.1982, questioned the  order of  termination through  writ petition No. 9484/74,  which was  dismissed  by  the  High  Court  on 23.8.1974. He  allowed that  order to  acquire finality  and lateron filed  a representation  against termination  of his services to the State which was also dismissed on 16.9.1975. Undeterred,  he   once  again   questioned  the   order   of termination by  filing a  petition before  the  U.P.  Public Service Tribunal.  That  petition  before  the  U.P.  Public Service Tribunal.  That petition  came to  be  dismissed  on 4.4.1979. The petitioner filed yet another writ petition No. 4536/79, for  the same cause which was dismissed by the High Court on 16.8.1979. A review petition against that order was dismissed on  16.1.1980 and an application under Article 133 of the  Constitution for  a certificate  of fitness  seeking leave to  appeal to  the Supreme  Court was dismissed by the High Court  on 26.3.1980. The petitioner filed special leave petition No.  536/81 which came to be dismissed by this writ petition putting  the same  termination order  in issue.  We take a  serious view of the matter and condemn this practice of filing  petition after  petition. No litigant has a right to unlimited drought on court time and public money in order to get  the affair settled in the manner he wishes. Finality of judicial  proceedings must  he accepted  at some  in  the manner it  has been  done by the petitioner in this case. We dismiss this  writ petition  with Rs.  5,000/- as costs.

" O R D E R This Special  Leave Petition  arises from  the order of the National  Consumer Disputes  Redressal  Commission,  New Delhi. The  petitioners had  loan taken  from the respondent Bank on two accounts, one for a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- and the other for  Rs. 3,00,000/-. It would appear that the Bank had disbursed a  sum of  Rs 1.47 lacs and the balance amount was not released  to the  petitioners. It was their case, in the complaint laid  before  the  District  Forum,  that  due  to deficiency in service, namely, failure to disburse the total amount contracted  under the agreement, the petitioner could not carry  on the  business and discharge the obligations to pay the labour charges and, therefore, could not manufacture the products  for which orders had been served. Since, there was Since,  there was  slump in  the market,  they could not discharge the  contract  for  repayment.  Accordingly,  they filed the complaint for damages in the sum of Rs.9.50,000/-. The Tribunals  below dismissed  the case  and  the  National Commission confirmed the dismissal of the complaint on three grounds. First,  the petitioner  had not  complied with  the conditions of  the  agreement  of  repayment,  thereby  they committed breach  of the  contract. They  cannot, therefore, complain of  the deficiency of service. Another ground given was that  the suit was filed by the Bank for recovery on the premise that  the Tribunal  could not go into that question. Thirdly it was filed by the bank for recovery on the premise that the  Tribunal could  not go into the question. Thirdly, it was  stated that  in a letter addressed b the petitioners to the  Bank that  they had admitted that the failure to pay the instalments  was due  to slump  in  the  market  of  the finished products  and, therefore,  they could not repay the loan. Though we  find that  there is  not much  force in  the findings recorded  by the  courts below  on  the  first  tow grounds, the  last grounds merits acceptance. It pursuant to the contract  the Bank  did not  disburse the  amount and if there was  any resultant  default in  the payment on account thereof, that  may be  a defence  open to the petitioners in the suit  and also furnishes right to complain of deficiency in service  to seek  redressal under the Consumer Protection http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Act. On  that Ground,  the relief  could not be rejected and the question  was required  to be  gone into.  Secondly, the mere filing  of the  suit for recovery of the amount may not be an  absolute bar  on  the  commission  to  go  into  that question for  the reason  that the  issue before  that Civil Court is  not the  deficiency in  the service unless that is specifically raised  as defence  in the  suit.   However, we think that  is  one  of  defaults  in  the  payment  of  the instalments. Under those circumstances, merely filing of the suit by  the Bank  does not  put a bar on the Tribunal to go into  the  merits  in  the  complaint.  Each  case  requires examination on  the facts of the case. On the other hand, we find force  in reasoning  given by  the  Tribunal  on  third point, It  is the petitioner’s case that they were unable to produce the  goods and  have them  marketed to  pay back the loan in  instalments. It was not the case that it was due to deficiency in  service. On  the other  hand, it  is admitted that due  to slump  in the  market they  could not  sell the goods, realise  the price  of the  finished product  and pay back the  loan to  the Bank.  That admission stands in their way to  plead at  the late  stage that they suffered loss on account  of   the  deficiency   in  service.   Under   those circumstances,  we   do  not   find  any  ground  warranting interference. The leave petition is dismissed.","The petitioners had loan taken  from the respondent Bank on two accounts, one for a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- and the other for  Rs. 3,00,000.

" J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: Nanavati,J. The appellant  was tried  for committing  murder of one Ashok on 12.4.1986 at 6.30 a.m. The Trial Court believed the prosecution witnesses  and held that in all 10 injuries were caused by  the accused  with a  knife and that three or four injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause his  death. It,  however, held that as the prosecution has failed to prove that the accused had any motive to cause death of  Ashok, it  would not  be  proper  to  convict  the appellant under  Section 302  IPC. So it convicted him under Section 304 Part II IPC. The appellant  challenged his  conviction by  filing an appeal to  the High  Court. The  State also  filed an appeal against the  acquittal under appeal against the acquittal of the  appellant   under  Section  302  IPC.  The  High  Court dismissed the  appellant’s appeal  and  allowed  the  appeal filed by the State and convicted the appellant under Section 302 IPC.  The appellant  has, therefore,  filed this  appeal challenging the judgment and passed by the High Court. Both the  courts have believed the evidence of PW1, who was himself  an eye-witness  and PWs  3 and  4. The  learned counsel  was   not  able  to  point  out  any  flaw  in  the appreciation of  evidence by  the High  Court. We therefore, proceed on the basis that the finding that their evidence is trustworthy and correct. If their evidence is believed, then it has  to be  held that  the finding recorded by the courts below regarding  causing of  injuries by  the accused to the deceased is  also proper. The appellant had given as many as 10 blows  with a  knife to  the deceased  who  was  unarmed. Merely because  there was some grappling between the accused and the deceased, possibly because the deceased tried to see that the  blows did  not hit him, it cannot be said that the accused was  entitled to  give those blows in exercise right of private  defence of  was entitled to any other exception. As the  injuries caused  by the accused to the deceased were intentional and  they were  found to  be sufficient  in  the ordinary course  of nature to cause death, the appellant was rightly held  guilty under  Section 302  IPC. The High Court http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was, therefore,  justified in altering the Conviction of the appellant from  under Section 304 Part II IPC to Section 302 IPC. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.","The appellant had given as many as 10 blows  with a knife to the deceased who was unarmed.

" WITH WRIT PETITION (C) NO.3881 OF 1983 O R D E R A common  question arises  in the  Civil Appeal and the Writ Petition.  The Civil  Appeal is  directed  against  the order of  a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court summarily rejecting the  appellants’ writ  petition upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The appellants  imported partially oriented yarn (POY). They  claimed   for  the  purposes  of  countervailing  duty (additional duty)  the benefit  of an exemption notification dated 28th  February, 1982, issued under Rule at 8(1) of the Central Excise  Rules whereby man-made fibres and yarns were exempted from excise duty as therein stated. The controversy was whether  the POY  imported by  the appellants  should be taken to fall within item (iv) under the head Polyestor Yarn relating to  POY of  75 deniers  and  above  but  below  100 deniers or  within item (iii) relating to POY of 100 deniers and above  but not above 750 deniers. it was the case of the appellants that  the POY  imported by  them was  entitled to exemption upon  the basis  that it  was of  100 deniers  and above but not above 750 denirs. The authorities treated the POY  imported by  the appellants  as falling  within the slot of 75 deniers and above but below 100 deniers and they did  so  upon  the  basis  of  a  circular  dated  24th September, 1980,  issued by  the Central  Board of  Excise & Customs  which   stated   that   POY   was   assessable   to countervailing duty  and excise  duty at the final denierage stage, that is to say, after the POY had been texturised. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that there was no warrant for levying countervailing duty upon imported goods at a stage they would reach subsequent to their import after undergoing a process. They had to be subjected to duty in the state in which they were when imported. Reference was made to  the judgment  of a  Single Judge of the Bombay High http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court in  Krislon Texturiser  Pvt. Ltd.  vs. Union of India, (1989) 44 ELT 488 [S.P. Bharucha, J.1, which was followed by a Division  Bench of  the High  Court of Gujarat in Special] Civil Application No. 1165 of 1903, Vareli Exports Pvt. Ltd. and another  vs. Union  of India  and others where it was so held. Learned counsel  for the respondents fairly stated that the view taken in these judgments was unassailable. The circular  upon the  basis of  which  the  duty  was levied having been issued in Delhi, the Delhi High Court had jurisdiction to  entertain  and  try  the  appellants’  writ petition. Countervailing duty  must be  levied on  goods  in  the state in which they are when they are imported. Section 3 of the Customs  Tariff Act so mandates. The POY imported by the appellants fell in the slot of 100 deniers and above but not above 75O deniers. It was, therefore, liable to that rate of countervailing duty  as was  provided for in the said clause (iv) of the exemption notification.

The following Order of the Court was delivered ORDER http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Delay condoned. Leave granted. These three appeals are directed against three orders of the  Calcutta  High Court dated  12.4.1985,  11.10.1985  and 24.1.1986. H.N.  Kirtania, respondent is in the employment  of  the Central Government, under the Central Passport Organisation. At  the  relevant period he was posted as  Public  Relations Officer  in the Regional Passport Office, Calcutta.  He  was transferred  from  Regional  Passport  Office,  Calcutta  to Jaipur under an order dated 14.9. 1985. He was relieved from Regional  Passport  Office,  Calcutta on  15.3.1985  with  a direction  to report for duty to the Regional  Passport  Of- fice, Jaipur. He did not join his duty at Jaipur instead  he proceeded on leave for a month. During the period, he was on leave  the respondent filed a writ petition in the  Calcutta High Court assailing the validity of his transfer. A learned single  Judge  issued  order on  12.4.1985  restraining  the Central  Government  authorities from giving effect  to  the order  of transfer and release. An application for  vacating the  interim order was filed on behalf of the appellant  but the  same  was not disposed of. In  the  meantime,  contempt proceedings  were initiated against the authorities  at  the instance of the respondent on the allegation that he was not allowed  to rejoin his duty at Calcutta in pursuance to  the interim  injunction.  A learned single Judge  by  his  order dated 11.10.1985 issued rule for contempt to the  appellants and further issued interim direction for paying all  arrears of  salary to the respondent within three weeks. The  appel- lants  filed an appeal before a Division Bench of  the  High Court against the aforesaid order alongwith an interim  stay application. The interim stay application was dismissed by a Division  Bench of the High Court on 24.1.1986. In  view  of these orders the transfer order could not be implemented and the respondent continued to stay at Calcutta. After hearing learned counsel for the parties we do not find any 396 valid  justification for the High Court for  entertaining  a writ petition against the order of transfer made against  an employee  of  the Central  Government  holding  transferable post.  Further there was no valid justification for  issuing injunction  order  against the Central Government.  The  re- spondent  being a Central Government employee held a  trans- ferable  post and he was liable to be transferred  from  one place to the other in the country, he has no legal right  to insist for his posting at Calcutta or at any other place  of his  choice.  We do not approve of the  cavalier  manner  in which the impugned orders have been issued without consider- ing the correct legal position. Transfer of a public servant made on administrative grounds or in public interest  should not be interfered with unless there are strong and  pressing grounds  rendering the transfer order illegal on the  ground of violation of statutory rules or on ground of mala  fides. There  was no good ground for interfering with the  respond- ent’s transfer. We accordingly allow the appeals and set aside the  High Court’s  orders dated 12.4.1985, 11.10.1985  and  24.1.1986. There will be no order as to costs. T.N.A.                                      Appeals allowed. ?397","H.N.

" J U D G M E N T Shah, J. Leave granted. Despite service of notice, none appears on behalf of the respondents. By impugned judgment and order dated 27.11.2000 the High Court of Madras allowed Criminal OP No.14007 of 1999 and quashed the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") on the ground that there was breach of mandatory provision in issuing the notice as the cheque was returned on 13th January, 1994 and complainant issued notice on 29th January, 1994, which fell outside the period of 15 days. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that appellant filed criminal complaint before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Chennai, on the ground that in respect of a liability on a promissory note, a cheque was issued in favour of the complainant on 12.1.1994 for a sum of Rs.5 lakhs.  When the cheque was presented in the bank, it was returned on 13.1.1994 with an endorsement ""payment stopped by drawer"".  Hence, appellant issued notice on 29.1.1994 which was received by the respondent on 4.2.1994.  It is submitted that the appellant was informed about the dishonour of cheque only on 17.1.1994 as there were Pongal holidays between 14th to 16th January, 1994.  For this purpose, he has relied upon deposition of PW1 Gopal Krishnan, Company Secretary of the appellant-company, PW2 Shri Muralidharan, Manager, Bank of Baroda, who has stated that on 13.1.1994 cheque was received back by the bank with an endorsement ""payment stopped by the drawer"" and that debit advice was sent to the complainant on 17.1.1994 as 14th to 16th were holidays for Pongal. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In our view, the High Court committed material irregularity in not referring to the aforesaid evidence which was recorded by the Metropolitan Magistrate.  Section 138(b) of the Act inter alia provides that the payee has to make demand for the payment of money by giving a notice ""to the drawer of the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid"".  So fifteen days are to be counted from the receipt of information regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid.  In the present case, it is the say of the complainant that the cheque was presented for encashment on 12th; it was returned to the bank on 13th and information was given to the complainant only on 17th, as 14th, 15th and 16th were pongal holidays.  The learned counsel fairly pointed out that in the complaint it has been stated that complainant had received intimation with regard to the return of the said cheque from his banker on 13.1.1994.  However, he submitted that this is apparent mistake and for explaining that mistake the appellant has led the evidence before the trial court.  Undisputedly, he pointed out that in the State of Tamilnadu 14th to 16th January, 1994 there were Pongal holidays and, therefore, appellant came to learn about the dishonour of his cheque on 17.1.1994. It appears that the High Court has not considered the evidence of PW1 Gopal Krishnan and PW2 Muralitharan and has passed the impugned order holding that notice before filing the complaint under Section 138 of the Act was not issued within stipulated period of fifteen days.  It also appears that the Court while quashing the criminal complaint on 27.11.2000, which was filed in 1994, did not call for the record of the proceedings of the trial court for its verification. In this view of the matter, the appeal stands allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside.  The trial court is directed to proceed with the matter in accordance with law. ...............................J.","The High Court of Madras allowed Criminal OP No.14007 of 1999 and quashed the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION ) NO.8439 OF 2007 1.          The petitioner in this special leave petition is a tenant in respect of Booth No.22, Sector 34-C, Chandigarh in the State of Punjab (in short ’the demised premises) who has been sought to be evicted by the respondent on the ground that she required the demised premises for her personal use and for opening a retail-cum-wholesale shop of garments in the demised premises which was a non-residential building. The Rent Controller dismissed the application of the landlady/respondent. Feeling aggrieved, an appeal was carried before the appellate authority which had reversed the finding on  the  question  of  bona  fide  requirement  and directed eviction of the petitioner. Against the order of eviction passed by the appellate authority reversing the order of rejection passed by the Rent Controller, the petitioner approached the High Court for setting aside the order of the appellate authority. The High Court by the impugned order has rejected the  application filed by the tenant/petitioner against which this special leave petition  has  been filed which was heard on notice in presence of the learned counsel for the parties. 2.           Mr.P.K.Ghosh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the tenant/petitioner sought to argue that  in order to come to a conclusion on the question of bona fide requirement of the landlady/ respondent, the High Court as well as the appellate authority had failed to consider the material provisions of the Act as well as the material evidence on record for which the decree could be passed in favour of the landlady. For this purpose, we   have examined  the  finding  of  the  appellate authority as well as of the High Court and we find that  the High Court as well as the appellate authority on  consideration  of  the material evidence,  oral  and documentary, came to a conclusion of fact that the landlady/respondent was entitled  to  an order of eviction. Mr. Ghosh, however, could not satisfy us by showing that the findings on  the  question  of bona fide requirement of the landlady/respondent was either perverse or arbitrary or they had failed to consider the provisions of the Act for grant of an order of eviction. That  being http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the  position and in view of the fact  that this special leave petition is concluded by the concurrent finding of fact arrived at by the  appellate  authority  as well as by the High Court  on  the  question of bona fide requirement, we have no other alternative but to dismiss the special leave petition. Accordingly, this special leave petition is rejected. 3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we grant time to the petitioner to vacate the premises in question by 31st of March, 2009, subject to filing a usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from this date.","The High Court by the impugned order has rejected the application filed by the tenant/petitioner against which this special leave petition has been filed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated November  1, 1989  of the  Division Bench of the Patna High Court  in C.W.J.C. No.1904 of 1989, dismissing the writ petition of the appellant. Learned counsel for the appellant contended  that   the  appellant  had  not  been  given  any opportunity before computing the liability of provident fund and the  damages  under  the  Provident  Fund  Miscellaneous Provisions Act,  1952.  On  a  representation  made  by  the appellant the  Regional Provident  Fund Commissioner, Bihar, at Patna  in his  letter dated  21st September,  1993 stated thus: ""Please  refer  to  your  representation dated  27.8.93   on  the  subject  cited above. The point raised by you in the aforesaid petition is  required to  be examined in detail vis-a-vis  statutory  provisions, Pending decision  in the matter, you are hereby  communicated  the  decision  the extent that  the  payment  of  employees share of P.F. contribution is waived for the period  6/77 to  9/85 in  accordance with the  existing  directions.  It  is, however,  made  clear  that  as  regards other points,  the petition  will remain as before."" In view  of the  waiver of the payment of the liability of the  employee’s share  of the provident fund contribution for the  period commencing from June 1977 to September 1985, the appellant  is relieved  of the  liability to deposit the said  amount.  The  amount  due  on  that  account  was  not indicated in  the letter.  Therefore, the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner is directed to indicate by separate letter as to  what was  the amount due and payable by the appellant http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for the  said period  towards the  payment of the employee’s share of  the provident  fund. After  deduction of  the said amount, the  appellant shall provisionally pay a further sum of Rs.10  lakhs in  addition to  the sum of Rs.8 Lakhs which had already  been paid. This Court on May 3, 1993 passed the following order in similar matters : ""The SLPs  are dismissed. It is open for the petitioner  to collect  the names of the  Bidi  Workers  who  work  for  them through their  contractors  and  furnish the names  of all  the  workers  to  the Provident   Fund    Commissioner.    The Provident Fund  Commissioner  thereafter will verify  these names  and  calculate the liability  of the  petitioner on the basis  of   such  verification.  If  any excess amount  is  found  due  from  the petitioner,    the     Provident    Fund Commissioner will  recover  such  amount from the  petitioner, on the other hand, if  any  amount  is  found  due  to  the petitioner,    the     Provident    Fund Commissioner will  refund the  same. The petitioner  to   furnish  names  of  the workers, as above within six months from today."" In this view of the matter, the case is remanded to the Regional Provident  Fund Commissioner  to follow  the  above directions  and  compute  the  liability  of  the  appellant afresh. In  case the  liability falls  short of  the  amount already deposited then the appellant shall pay the shortfall within a  period to  be  specified  by  the  Provident  Fund Commissioner.

Though many points were urged in respect of the appeal, we find that the impugned order of the High Court cannot be maintained on one ground. Though it had issued notice to the appellant, the matter was disposed of without hearing the appellant.  It appears that respondent no.1 had filed the bail application, that is, Criminal Misc. Petition No.2945/2004 on 10.12.2004. The court directed service on the appellant. There is no dispute that there was no service of notice on the appellant.  According to the appellant, on learning about the proceedings, Criminal Misc. Application No.4653/05 was filed in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.2945/04.  The High Court was pleased to issue notice on 14.7.2005 on the said application and the High Court directed the accused to implead the appellant. Learned Additional Sessions Judge dismissed the bail application of the accused, respondent No.1 on the ground that relief had already been obtained by her from the High Court. On 22.9.2005, without service on the appellant, the High Court converted the application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short ’Cr.P.C.’), to one under Section 438 Cr.P.C. and granted interim protection. 3.      Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that several facts were suppressed.  By giving wrong impression about the factual scenario, the appellant persuaded the High Court to pass the impugned order.  In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that there is in fact no infirmity in the order.  In any event, the charge sheet has been filed and respondent no.1-accused has already been granted regular bail.  A copy of the order passed on the bail application has been filed for records. 4.      It is to be noted that the practice of converting applications filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to one for bail in terms of Section 438 or 439 Cr.P.C. has not been approved by this Court.  Additionally, direction was given for issuance of notice and service on the appellant which has not been done http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 by respondent no.1-accused.  The fact that the charge-sheet has been filed or bail has been granted is really of no consequence because of the fact that relief in the regular bail application appears to have been granted to respondent no.1 in view of the interim protection given by the High Court to the accused by the impugned order. 5.      In view of the aforesaid position, the impugned order is set aside and the matter is remanded for fresh consideration. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.  To avoid unnecessary delay let the parties appear without further notice on 23rd  November, 2007, before learned Single Judge. If any party does not appear on that day, needless to say learned Single Judge shall deal with the matter in accordance with law.  Learned Chief Justice of the High Court is requested to direct listing of the matter before learned Single Judge according to the roaster. 6.      The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.","The High Court had issued notice to the appellant, the matter was disposed of without hearing the appellant.

" J U D G M E N T Thomas j. This appeal  by special  leave is  in challenge  of  an order of  the High  Court of Patna dated 8.5.1995 by which a Division Bench  has refused to modify an earlier order dated 2.2.1993. Appellants  herein are  the  Bihar  State  Housing Board, its  Managing Director  and its Executive Engineer at Harun-Ranchi. Bihar State  Housing  Board  (For  short  ’the  Housing Board’) put  up flats  under a  housing scheme.  As per  the allotment order  dated 9.12.1983,  a flat bearing No.H-1/200 was allotted  to the  respondent  at  a  tentative  cost  of Rs.85,400/- The  respondent was  to pay a sum of Rs.17,230/- as the  initial payment.  As  the  respondent  had  paid  an advance of Rs.6,500/- he was permitted to deduct it from the initial payment and thus he was to pay Rs.10,730/- in a lump within thirty  days from  the date  of allotment  order. But respondent paid  that amount  only in  1987 presumably  with interest (as he paid an amount of Rs.17,541/-) As per clause 6 of  the allotment  order the  allotment  was  to  pay  the balance  amount   of  Rs.68,320/-   in  monthly  instalments alongwith interest.  The case  of the  respondent is that he could not  execute the  agreement as  was  required  in  the allotment order as the flat remained incomplete. He informed the Housing  Board that he had to take another house on rent on account  of it.  Respondent then  filed a  writ  petition before the High Court for appropriate reliefs. By order  dated 2.2.1993,  a Division Bench of the High Court directed  that if  the respondent  would  deposit  the balance amount  of Rs.68,320/-  as mentioned  in clause 6 of the allotment  order, the Housing Board shall deliver vacant possession of  the flat  to him  with all  the fittings  and fixtures required to be done ""within one month from the date of last  deposit of  the  amount"".  The  Board  was  further directed to indicate the date when respondent was to execute the date when respondent deposits that last instalments. On 15.2.1993,  the Executive  Engineer of  the  Housing Board required  the respondent to get the agreement executed after depositing the amount of Rs.68,320/- within two months and to  take physical  possession of  the flat.  It  is  now http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 admitted that  respondent had  paid the said amount. But the Housing  Board   thereafter  moved   the  High   Court   for modification of  the order dated 2.2.1993 on three different occasions, and  the High  Court has  declined to  modify the order on all those three occasions. The main  thrust  of  argument  of  Sri  Ranjit  Kumar, learned counsel  for the Housing Board is that the amount of Rs.85,400 was  fixed in the allotment order only tentatively and the allotment is liable to pay the revised rate when the Housing Board estimates the final amount. That is altogether a different  aspect since the claim of the Board now is that respondent is  liable to  pay  interest  on  the  amount  of Rs.68,320/- since  respondent has  failed to pay the monthly instalment of Rs.980/- form the date of allotment. At the  first blush, it appeared that there is merit in the aforesaid  claim of  the Housing  Board. But on a closer look we  noticed the  other side  of the picture. Respondent further alleges that the flat in the present incomplete form is being  used by the Housing Board for storing cement stock with them. If is a fact which is not disputed before us that the  flat   remains  incomplete.   Appellants   blames   the respondent for it as no agreement was executed but liability to execute  the agreement  cannot  be  insisted  on  without completing the construction of the flat. In the  above situation, we do not think that this is a fit case  for interference with the order of the High Court. While dismissing  this appeal we grant two months’ time from to the Housing Board to comply with the directions issued by the High Court in the order dated 2.2.1993.",Bihar State Housing Board put up flats under a housing scheme in 1983. It was to pay the balance amount in monthly instalments along with interest. But the flat remained incomplete and the Housing Board was unable to take physical possession of it.,special leave petitions,23.99
" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1256 OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(C) No.22049/2005] Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. By an order dated 30/9/1993, the appellant was appointed as Assistant Engineer purely on adhoc basis and as a stopgap arrangement w.e.f. 1/10/1993.  Subsequently, his service was regularised w.e.f. 21/6/1997.  His grievance is that his seniority as Assistant Engineer was not counted w.e.f. 1/10/1993.  In other words, he prayed that his seniority as Assistant Engineer should be counted from 1/10/1993, the date from which he was appointed on adhoc basis.  In this connection, learned counsel for the appellant referred to a decision of this Court rendered in T. Vijayan & Ors. Vs. Divisional Railway Manager & Ors., (2000) 4 SCC 20.   While referring to an earlier judgment of this Court rendered in Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers Association Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors., (1990) 2 SCC 715, it was held ........2. - 2 - that once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to the relevant rule, his seniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the date of his regularisation. This Court further pointed out that the corollary of the above rule is that where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stopgap arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for considering the seniority. Learned counsel for the appellant strongly relied on the direction (B) which reads a s under:- (B)  If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure laid down by the rules but the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules, the period of officiating service will be counted."" We regret, we cannot agree with the learned counsel.  The decision in T. Vijayan’s case (supra) was by a two-Judge Bench of this Court, but a somewhat different view has been taken in a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in M.K. Shanmugam Vs. Union of India, (2004) 4 SCC 476 in para 8 of which it was observed -- ""It is only in those cases where initially they had been recruited even though they have been appointed ad hoc the recruitment was subject to  the  same  process  as it had .....3. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 - 3 - been done in the case of regular appointment and that the same was not a stopgap arrangement.""  Thus, all adhoc service prior to regular appointment cannot be counted for seniority, etc.  It counts only where the initial adhoc appointment is made by the same process as is applicable to regular appointment. In the case at hand, the initial appointment of the appellant is, as already noted, purely on adhoc basis and that too not in accordance with the rules for regular appointment.  The consistent view taken by this Court is that even if an appointment is made on adhoc basis by following procedure according to the rules for regular selection, the   period   of   such  adhoc  appointment could be counted.  However, if the adhoc appointment, as in the case at hand, is made purely on adhoc basis without following the procedure prescribed under the rules for regular appointment such period spent as adhoc appointee cannot be counted.  This is the law settled by M.K. Shanmugam’s case (supra). Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is a rule for adhoc appointment, and the appellant was appointed under that rule. Hence, he submitted that his adhoc service be counted.  We regret we cannot agree.  In our opinion, for adhoc service to be counted it is not enough that there is a rule  permitting  adhoc appointment.   It is also ......4. - 4 - necessary that the appointment was made after following the procedure prescribed for making a regular appointment.  Only then will the adhoc service be counted, otherwise it will not. In view thereof, there is no merit in this appeal.  It is, accordingly, dismissed.",The appellant was appointed as Assistant Engineer purely on adhoc basis and as a stopgap arrangement w.e.f. 1/10/1993.

This Appeal by special leave has been preferred by the State of U.P.  against the Judgment and Order of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 27th August, 1999 in Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.17655 of 1995 whereby the High Court partly allowed the Writ Petition and modified the Order dated 18.1.1995 by which 75% of the Respondent’s pension was withheld. This followed a departmental proceeding against the respondent in which he was found  guilty of certain charges. The respondent was a doctor employed in the hospital run by the Employees State ...2/- -2- Insurance Corporation and certain allegations were made against him with regard to illegal appointments, unjustified expenditure etc. It appears that during the pendency of the proceeding the respondent retired from service and the impugned order was passed on 18.1.1995 after his retirement. Obviously, therefore, no punishment could be inflicted upon him but his pensionary benefits could be curtailed in accordance with the Rules. We have gone through the charges framed against the respondent. It also appears from the record that some other doctors were proceeded against on similar charges and some punishment was imposed upon them such as stoppage of two increments, etc. However, looking at the nature of charges levelled against the respondent and the findings of the Inquiry Officer which have been accepted by the disciplinary authority, we are of the view that withholding of pension of the respondent to the extent of 75% is excessive. We, therefore, modify the order dated 18.1.1995 and direct that the reduction of 25% of pension only shall ...3/- -3- be made. The respondent will be entitled to the difference in the pensionary dues calculated on the basis that only 25% of the pension is to be withheld.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.1359 OF 2008 [Arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.11109 of 2006] Leave granted. The respondent was working as a security guard.  While he was on duty, the Managing Director of the appellant-company was assaulted by three workers.  The respondent failed to take any preventive action against the miscreants.  Consequently, a charge-sheet was issued against the respondent for the said act of misconduct.  Since the respondent refused to accept the charge-sheet, another charge-sheet was issued against him.  He tendered his reply to the first charge-sheet.  The explanation offered by him was not found satisfactory and a domestic enquiry was held against him.  He was found guilty of misconduct.  On the basis of the findings of the enquiry officer, the respondent was dismissed. Action had been taken against the respondent in an earlier case.  Hence, he raised a n industrial dispute and the reference was pending before the Industrial Tribunal.  The Management filed an application under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 seeking  approval of the action of C.A.No.1360/08 .... (Contd.) - 2 - dismissal taken against the respondent for not preventing the miscreants from assaulting the Managing Director.  The Industrial Tribunal dismissed the application thereby declining the approval of the action taken by the appellant. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Cou rt which was dismissed by a learned Single Judge.  The Management thereafter filed a Letters Patent Appeal. During the pendency of the Letters Patent Appeal being L.P.A.No.847 of 2003, a settlement was arrived at between the Management and the workman and an application, viz., I.A.No.1072 of 2004 in LPA No.847 of 2003 was filed by the appellant seeking disposal of the LPA in terms of the settlement arrived at between the parties.  It was state d in the application that a sum of Rs.4,65,000/- had been paid to the respondent-workman vide two cheques, namely, Cheque No.671163 dated 15.5.2004 for an amount of Rs.4,29,285/- and Cheque No.620597 of the same date for an amount of Rs.35,715/- drawable at State Bank of India, Rehla thus making a total of Rs.4,65,000/- towards provident fund dues.  The Division Bench, however, without taking note of the application for settlement, disposed of the LPA by affirming the order of the learned Single Judge. The said order is in challenge before us.

This is an appeal  by  special leave and is connected with Civil Appeal No. 859. This is an appeal  from  the judgment and order of the  High  Court  of Delhi dated 30th May, 1986. It  appears  that in October, 1975, Trade  Notices  were http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 issued  on  the basis of the directive of  the  Ministry  of Finance to the effect that the owners of the brand name  are to  be treated as the manufacturers of the goods. In  April, 1977,  price list submitted by the respondent declaring  the assessable  value  on the basis of the price  at  which  the assessee-respondent  sold  the  goods.  Thereafter  on  16th April, 1977, there was a letter written by respondent giving the  list of the customers of the respondent and  clarifying the  terms  and conditions on which the  assessee  sold  the goods. On August 22, 1977, the appellants wrote a letter  to the assessee-respondent seeking certain information, intera- lia, to the effect whether the assessee and its buyers  were related  persons. A reply was given on 10th September,  1977 by  the assessee to the aforesaid letter. First  notice  was issued  asking  the  assessee to show cause as  to  why  the assessable  value be not determined at the price the  buyers of  the  assessee sold the goods (instead of  the  price  at which the assessee sold the goods to its buyers). There  was a reply and the second show cause notice was issued on  28th January, 1981. These show cause notices were challenged  and the High Court quashed the said notices. Aggrieved  thereby, this appeal has been filed. The  respondent is a registered company carrying on  the business  of manufacturing and selling filters. Some of  the goods are sold by the respondent to its customers under  the respective brand names. The respondent filed a price list at which price the goods were sold to the customers. In  view of the principles indicated in the judgment  in Civil  Appeal No. 859 and the facts adduced before the  High Court,  the High Court’s judgment cannot be interfered.

" O R D E R Leave granted. In view of the explanation given in the application for restoration of  special leave  petitions dismissed  on  11th December, 1996 for default of non appearance of the counsel, although the  case  was  called  out  twice,  the  order  is recalled. We have  heard the  counsel  on  merit.  The  appellant Association  claims   promotions  of  pollution  Level  Test Inspectors on  par with  Motor Vehicles Inspectors under the Motor Vehicles Act. Pursuant to a representation made by the appellant to  open a  channel of  promotion to  them  ,  the Tribunal by  order dated  April 24,  1992 had  directed  the respondents  to   create  posts     and   provided  suitable promotional avenues and to set time for the said purpose. In the meanwhile,  when the  junior Motor  Vehicles  Inspectors were being  considered for  promotion by the D.P.C. as Motor Vehicle Inspectors,  the appellant  filed a  petition in the Tribunal for  implementation of  the judgement  and pointing out the  contempt. Since  the respondents, in the meanwhile, promoted motor  Vehicle Inspectors,  the appellant filed the application stating  that the  respondents had  violated the order of the Tribunal. In the meanwhile, the Government have turned down  the proposal  for creation  of the  avenues for promotion  of  Anti-Pollution  Level  Test  Inspectors.  The appellant again  filed a  petition for  contempt  which  was dismissed. Thus this appeal by special leave. It would  been seen  that, admittedly,  members of  the appellant-Association  are  Technical  Anti-Pollution  Level Test Inspectors.  Under the Motor Vehicles Act, the cadre of Motor Vehicle  Inspectors has  statutory base and, therefor, the Motor  Vehicle Inspectors  are distinct  from T.A.P.L.T. Inspectors represented  through  the  appellant-Association. When we  had put  a question  to Shri  Krishnamani,  learned senior counsel, whether the appellants are entitled to claim under the  statutory rules,  to be  on par with junior Motor Vehicle Inspectors, he admitted that they are not members of the same cadre or service and are not governed by the Rules. Therefore, they  cannot have  any parity  with  a  statutory cadre officers.  It would  be for the appropriate Government http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to take  policy decision.  The Tribunal  is not competent to give  directions   to  lay  down  the  policy  or  to  issue directions to  create promotional  avenues. Such a direction would amount to entrenching upon area of policy making which is  exclusively   within  the  purview  of  the  appropriate Government. The  Tribunal, therefore, was right in rejecting the application and holding that there was no contempt. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","Tribunal by order dated April 24, 1992 had directed the respondents to create posts for Anti-Pollution Level Test Inspectors.

" O R D E R These appeals arise from the order of the High Court of Delhi dated  December 9,  1980 made  in Civil  Revision  No. 923/80. The  facts not in dispute are that the appellant was inducted into  possession of  the properties,  plots bearing Nos. 32, 33 & 35 admeasuring 384 sq. yards situated in Wazir Pur, Kotla Mubarakpur, New Delhi by Smt. Vimla Devi, the 3rd respondent. He had filed a civil suit for injunction against the respondent.  Ultimately, the  decree of  the trial court granting injunction  became final.  In  the  meanwhile,  the appellant as  well as  respondent  Nos.  1  &  2  each  have purchased 1/3rd  share of  the property.  Consequently, suit No. 27/73  was filed  for partition  and separate possession thereof. Preliminary  decree was  granted on  September  24, 1974 & final decree thereof was passed on May 22, 1980. Thus the rights  of the  parties  stood  worked  out  namely  the appellant &  respondent Nos.  1 and  2 are entitled to 1/3rd share each  in the total extent of the land as per the final decree granted by the civil court.

The  trial Court granted execution  to consign the respondents No. 1 and 2 to civil prison  and mandatory  injunction for  removal of  the respondents’ possession  of the  entire property with police assistance. The  appeal was  dismissed. While dismissing the revision  under   Section  115   CPC  as   being  barred  by limitation, the  High Court  suo motu  exercised  its  power under Article  227 of  the Constitution  and set  aside  the order of the execution court. Feeling aggrieved against that order, this appeal has been filed. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In view  of the fact that the parties have accepted the final decree  dividing the  properties into 1/3rd share each and allowing  that final decree to become final, the parties are bound  by the  decree and  the appellant  is entitled to 1/3rd share for possession. Any other proceedings in respect of lands covered by the final decree in suit No. 27/73 would stand closed  and all the parties are to enforce their right under the final decree only.

Sincethe  work was  over, the services of the appellant  and  others  were  terminated.  He  sought  a reference under the  Industrial  Disputes  Act,  1947(for short, ‘the  Act’) contending  that thetermination being in the nature  of retrenchment  isin violation ofSection25-F of theIndustrial Disputes Act. The IndustrialTribunal and the High Court negatived the contention. Learned counsel  for the  appellant contends  that the judgment of  the High  Court of Bombay relied on  in the impugned orderMarch 28,  1995in  Writ Petition  No.488 of 1994 is perhaps not  applicable. Since the  appellant has worked for  more than  180  days,  Since  the  appellant  as retrenched employee  and if theprocedure contemplated under Section25-F ofthe Industrial DisputesAct, 1947 is applied to, this  retrenchment is  illegal.

[(1995) 5 SCC 653] in paragraph 3, this Court has  dealt  with  engagement  of  the  seasonal workman  in sugarcane crushing; in paragraph 4, it is stated that it was not a case of retrenchment of the workman, but of closure of the factory  after crushing season was over.

" W I T H CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 451-455 OF 1997 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 17404, 20099, 20100-20100A/93 and 8998/96) O R D E R Leave granted. We heard learned counsel for the parties. Admittedly, the  respondents came to be appointed on ad hoc basis  pursuant to  writ petition  fild earlier  by many others. The  High Court  by its  judgment dated  4.2.1991 in Writ Petition No 295337/90 had allowed the writ petition and set  aside  the  order  of  the  retrenchment  and  directed regularisation of  their services.  Some of the respondents, admittedly, are  senior to  those who had the benefit of the order of regularisation as confirmed by this Court as on May 10, 1991.  Consequently, following the earlier judgment, the High Court  in the impugned order allowed the writ petitions with similar  directions. Thus,  these  appeals  by  special leave have been filed. In view  of the  fact that  the earlier  orders of this Court have  become final,  the respondent  are  entitled  to regularisation of  their services.  The learned  counsel for the  appellants   has  brought  of  our  notice  that  since subsequently there was a development after the orders passed by this  Court, namely, some of the establishments have been handed to  the private  sector and  some of  them are in the process of  being wound up, the orders passed earlier by the High Court  as confirmed by this Court and the present order would cause hardship to the appellant-Corporation. We do not think that  we  can  go  into  that  aspect  of  the  matter particularly, when  the order  in  favour  of  some  of  the employees has  attained finality. Similarly, the respondents are entitled to the some benefit. However, if  there is any difficulty in working out, it will be  open to  the Corporation  to convene  a tri partite meeting consisting  of workers’,  Union, One of the officers of Labour  Department  and  an  officer  of  the  appellant- Corporation would  thrash out  the problems and arrive at an amicable settlement  to  diffuse  and  sort  out  the  above difficulty. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The appeals  are  accordingly dismissed. In view of the above directions,  the  direction  for  view  of  the  above directions, the  direction for  contempt issued  by the high Court  may   not  be   enforced.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(4) SCR 359 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave is granted. By the order under challenge, a Division Bench of the High Court at Delhi dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant challenging the validity of notices issued under Sections 148 and 143(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The High Court took the view that the appellant could have taken all the objections in its reply to the notices and that, at that stage, the writ petition was premature. Accordingly, the writ petition was dismissed on 31st January, 2001. Aggrieved by that order, the appellant is in appeal before us. Mr. M.L. Verma, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, submits that the impunged notices relate to seven assessment years; that during the pendency of these appeals, in respect of two assessment years, viz., 1995-96 and 1996-97, assessment has been completed against which appeals have been filed. Notices relating to the other five assessment years, viz., 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1997-98 and 1998-99, are now the subject-matter of these appeals. We see no justifiable reason to interfere with the order under challenge. However, we clarify that when a notice under Section 148 of the Income tax Act is issued, the proper course of action for the noticee is to file return and if he so desires, to seek reasons for issuing notices. The assessing officer is bound to furnish reasons within a reasonable time. On receipt of reasons, the noticee is entitled to file objections to issuance of notice and the assessing officer is bound to dispose of the same by passing a speaking order. In the instant case, as the reasons have been disclosed in these proceedings, the assessing officer has to dispose of the objections, if filed, by passing a speaking Order before proceeding with the assessment in respect of the abovesaid five assessment years. Insofar as the appeals filed against the order of assessment before the Commissioner (Appeals), we direct the appellate authority to dispose of the same, expeditiously. With the above observations, the civil appeals are dismissed. No costs.","High Court took the view that the appellant could have taken all the objections in its reply to the notices and that, at that stage, the writ petition was premature.

" WITH Writ Petition Nos. 939/1996 and 95/97 O R D E R This Court keeping in view the mandate of Articles 47 & 48A of  the Constitution  of India,  issued directions  from time to  time with  a view to tackle the problem arising out of chaotic  traffic conditions  and vehicular  pollution. We are not  satisfied with  the performance  of  the  concerned authorities in  tackling  the  acute  problem  of  Vehicular pollution and  traffic regulations  in Delhi.  Environmental protection appears to have taken a back seat. In fact we are distressed to  find that the directions given by this Court, from time  to time,  have not  evoked the response they were expected to  evoke. When this Court gave those directions it treated it  as a  legal issue  and proceeded  to examine the impact  of   the  right  flowing  from  Article  21  of  the Constitution of  India viz-a-viz  decline  in  environmental quality. Law  casts an  obligation on  the State  to improve public health  and protect  and improve the environment. The directions issued  by this  Court were  aimed at  making the State to  effectively discharge  their obligations. In their response the  Delhi Administration  and the  Union of  India have pleaded, among other factors, lack of man power to deal with the  growing menace  of chaotic  traffic and decline in the environmental quality. The directions  issued by  this Court  are meant  to be complied with  and we  wish to  emphasise  that  it  is  the obligation of  the State  to comply  with the  same. On  our part, we  are considering  the  desirability  of  appointing Court Officers  to assist  the administration with a view to ensure compliance  of the  directions issued  by this Court. Article 144  of the  Constitution  of  India  provided  ""All authorities, civil  and judicial,  in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Court."" We have suggested to learned counsel for the parties to give us a list of persons from every  colony/area in each of the 9 Police Districts of Delhi, who  maybe  appointed  as  such  Court  Officers  and suggest  the   manner  in   which  they   can   assist   the administration to  carry out  its obligations. This exercise by the  Court, we clarify would be with a view to supplement http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and augment  the efforts of the Delhi Administration and the Union of  India to  deal with  the acute  problem.  Let  the needful be done in ten weeks. The  learned   Additional  Solicitor  General  is  also directed to  have affidavits  filed  from  the  Ministry  of Petroleum and  Ministry of Surface Transport to disclose the steps taken  for supply  of lead  free petrol and the use of catalytic convertor  on the new as well as existing vehicles so as  to use  lead free  petrol throughout the country. The status report  in this  behalf together  with the affidavits shall be filed within ten weeks.

We  have  so  far  not received any  report from  that Committee. A direction shall issue to  the Committee  to submit a report about the action taken by  the Committee  for controlling vehicular pollution and the  connected matters.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, made on April 18, 1995 in Civil Writ Petition No.9648/1994. The first  respondent had  purchased furniture and said to be  used the  bank car  for unofficiaal purposes. On that ground, he  was surcharged.  The inspection report dated May 4,  1993   would  indicate  that  the  first  respondent  as president of  the Bank had not used the car while performing duties  and  responsibilities  according  to  the  statutory provisions and  the expenditure  incurred in that behalf and the value  of the  furniture  purchase  were  liable  to  be recovered from then personally. The enquiry conducted in the behalf  revealed   that  the   first  respondent   had  made unauthorised use  of the  bank car  and had made purchase of the furniture  etc. It  was opined  that he  had  needlessly incurred the expenditure and, therefore, the same was liable to be  recovered from  him as  surcharge. When he challenged this order  in the  High Court,  the High  Court allowed the writ  petiton  and  quashed  the  surcharge  order  and  the Annexure P.5  imposing surcharge  with cost of Rs.5,000/- to be borne  by the  State with  the liberty to proceed against the appellant for recovery thereof. When the matter had come up before  us, we  directed the Joint Registrar, Cooperative Societies to  give an  opportunity of  hearing  to  the  Ist respondent and  then to pass a reasoned order whether he had caused any  loss to Bank of which he is the Chairman. In the order dated  April 9,  1997, the  Registrar, after elaborate consideration  held   that  the   respondent  had   incurred expenditure in  the sum  of Rs.1,15,888/- towards the use of the vehicle  to attend  various official  functions. He also incurred expenditure  in the  sum of  Rs.1,01,650.48 towards the expenditure  for  the  purchase  of  the  furniture.  He actually performed  the journey  and used  the  car  in  the discharge of  his duties  as a  Chairman of the Board of the Directors of  the Bank.  He also purchased the furniture and the furniture  is being  used by the Bank and thereby he has http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 not caused any pecuniary loss to the Bank. In view  of the above finding, the direction issued for recovery of  the costs  personally from the first respondent is not  warranted and the High Court has rightly quashed the surcharge order. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, made on April 18, 1995 in Civil Writ Petition No.9648/1994.

" J U D G M E N T CRIMINAL MISCELLANEOUS PETITION NO.10384/2006 IN CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1006/2006 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court reversing the order of acquittal passed by the trial Judge i.e. learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narsinghpur. Appellant was tried for alleged commission of offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’). The trial Court found the evidence to be inadequate and held the accused-appellant not guilty and accordingly directed the acquittal. The State preferred an appeal questioning the said order of acquittal. It appears that the matter was listed for hearing on 1.5.2006. There was no appearance on behalf of the present appellant who was the respondent in the appeal before the High Court when the matter was taken up for final hearing. The High Court proceeded to hear the appeal in the absence of learned counsel and reversed the order of acquittal and held the appellant guilty of charged offences. It is the stand of learned counsel for the appellant that during the pendency of the appeal the appellant filed an application for permission to change the counsel and sought permission to engage one Mr. Ashutosh Singh, Advocate to appear on his behalf in place of Mr. Anil Nima who was earlier appearing at the time of hearing. By order dated 31.1.2005 the application was allowed and the Court granted permission to Mr. Ashutosh Singh to appear on behalf of the appellant in place of earlier counsel. But in the cause list for the concerned day in respect of the appeal, the name of earlier counsel appeared. According to learned counsel for the appellant in view of the aforesaid position, the appellant was unrepresented. Learned counsel for the respondent did not dispute the factual position as stated by the appellant. Since the name of learned counsel who had been permitted to appear on behalf of the present appellant   was not reflected in the cause list, obviously the appellant has http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 been prejudiced. This is a case where the order of acquittal passed in favour of the appellant has been reversed by the impugned judgment of the High Court. In the aforesaid circumstances, we set aside the order of the High Court and remit the matter for fresh consideration. To avoid unnecessary delay, let the parties appear before the High Court on 13th April, 2007 so that appropriate orders can be passed by the concerned bench. The name of Mr. Ashutosh Singh who was permitted to appear on behalf  of the present appellant by order dated 31.1.2005 shall be indicated in the cause list and not the name of learned counsel who was earlier appearing.  We make it clear that by remitting the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.","Appellant was tried for alleged commission of offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’).

" J U D G M E N T ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. This appeal is directed against the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court dismissing the second appeal filed by the appellant on the ground that there was no challenge to the finding recorded by the First Appellate Court regarding adverse possession. A brief reference to the factual aspects would suffice. A suit was filed by the respondents for declaration of title, and the suit was numbered as O.S. No.59/88.  Written statement was filed by the appellant who was the defendant.  The trial Court framed the following issues: a.      Whether the disputed property belongs to the plaintiff? b.      Whether the suit is maintainable? c.      What remedy/relief the plaintiff is entitled to? The trial Court dismissed the suit. The plaintiff (respondent herein) preferred an appeal and by judgment and order dated 11.9.1991 learned Additional District Judge, Ramnad, Madurai allowed the appeal. One of the major conclusions of the First Appellate Court was that the plaintiff had perfected title by adverse possession.  The appellant filed the second appeal taking the stand that no such issue was framed by the trial Court and, therefore, the defendant had no opportunity to adduce evidence on this question.  The High Court as noted above, dismissed the second appeal summarily on the ground that the First Appellate Court’s observations regarding adverse possession were not questioned and no ground was taken in the second appeal. There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent in spite of the notice. Learned counsel submitted that the High Court has clearly fallen in error by observing that there was no challenge to the finding regarding adverse possession.  He has referred to the memorandum of appeal in this regard. We find that the High Court has clearly erred in holding that there was no challenge by the appellant in the second appeal to the conclusions regarding adverse possession.   As a matter of fact, a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 question of law in this regard was formulated, as required under Section 100(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short ’CPC’). It appears from the memorandum of appeal that in the ground no.8 it was specifically stated as follows: ""the Appellate Court below had erred in passing issues other than those framed by the Trial Court thereby depriving appellant to tender evidence and documents on the new issues apart from the illegality and infirmity attached herewith."" A question was also formulated i.e. whether the lower Appellate Court is justified in dealing with issues other than those framed by the Trial Court and deciding the same in favour of the plaintiff depriving the defendant the opportunity to counter to plaintiff’s evidence. It has been clearly stated that there was no issue framed regarding the adverse possession. The lower Appellate Court was not justified in deciding issues which were not framed.  The High Court seems to have taken a view that there was no direct reference to the issue of adverse possession. But that is really of no consequence when the specific stand of the appellant was that there was no issue framed relating to adverse possession and, therefore, the First Appellate Court should not have recorded any finding on that regard. The Trial Court had not specifically framed any issue relating to adverse possession.  Under Section 107 of the CPC, the Appellate Court has power to frame issue other than those framed by the trial Court.  But here again the requirement is to refer them for trial. Consequentially, the defendant would have got opportunity to adduce evidence in that regard. Above being the position, the conclusions of the High Court do not appear to be correct, the judgment cannot be maintained and is accordingly set aside. The matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration.  It is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.

" O R D E R This petition  is filed  against the  judgment  of  the Division Bench  of the  Madhya Pradesh  High Court,  Gwalior Bench made on March 13, 1996 in L.P.A. No. 80/96. The  admitted  position  is  that  the  petitioner  was working as a Branch Manager in the respondent-Bank. A sum of Rs. 20,000/-  was found  to be  short in cash of the Branch. Therefore, disciplinary  proceedings were  initiated against him and  an enquiry  was conducted  and he  was removal from service. He  challenged the  order of  his removal in appeal which was dismissed; the writ petition filed by him was also dismissed by  the learned single Judge of the High Court and on appeal,  it was confirmed. The only controversy raised in the High Court was that as he  was not supplied with the copy of the enquiry report, the order  of dismissal  was bad  in law. The learned Single Judge as  well as  the Division Bench of the High Court have considered the  effect of  the judgment  of the Constitution Bench of  this Court  in Managing  Director, ECIL, Hyderabad and Ors.  v. B.  Karunakar and  Ors.[(19930 4  SCC 727]. The learned single  Judge as  well as  the Division Bench of the High Court had asked the petitioner as to what prejudice the petitioner had  suffered for non-supply thereof. Since there was no  adequate explanation  offered by the petitioner, the High Court  came t  the conclusion, that though  the copy of the  report was not supplied, on  the facts, as no prejudice was proved, it was not a case warranting interference. It is  contended by  Sri Khanduja,  learned counsel for the petitioner  that since  Court has laid down the law that supply of  copy of the enquiry report is a pre-condition for a competent  officer to  take  a  disciplinary  action,  the appropriate course  would have been to send back the case to the disciplinary  authority. For this course, normally there is no quarrel, as this Court had settled the law that a copy of the  report  needs  to  be  supplied  to  the  delinquent employee to  enable him  to make  representation against the proposed action or punishment and, thereafter, the authority is required  to consider  that explanation  offered  by  the punishment. In  this case, though copy of the report was not supplied, he  was asked  by the learned Single Judge as well http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 as by the Division Bench as to what prejudice he suffered on account of  non-supply of the report; but he was not able to satisfy the learned Judges as to the prejudice caused to him on account  of non-supply  of the  enquiry  report.  On  the facts, we  find that  there is no illegality in the decision taken by the High Court.

On  14.4.1981 the Government of Gujarat in exercise of the  powers  conferred  by Section 18(1) of  the  Wild  Life Protection  Act, 1972, declared a part of the forest area in Lakhphat  Taluka  of  Kutch.   District   as  a  ""Wild  life Sanctuary"".   The total area of the sanctuary was 765.79 Sq. K.M.  On 27.7.1993  it  cancelled that notification and  issued another  whereby  only a part of the said  reserved  forest: was  deciared  as the ""Chinkara Wild Life  Sanctuary’,  The area   so  declared  was  94.87   Sq.K.M.   The   said   two notifications  were  chalirnged by the petitioner by  filing writ  petition?   in the Gujarat High court The  High  Court quashed  both those notifications The result was.  that  the earlier   notification   dated    14.4.1981   was   revived. Thereafter  the  State Government made certain inquires  and decided  to  delimit  the area of that sanctuary as  it  was found  to  be  more than required and the  delimitation  was likeiy  to be helpful in systematically developing that area economically  by making use of its mineral wealth.  It  then moved  the  State  Legislature for  passing  an  appropriate resolution   in  that  behalf.    The   State   Legislature, thereafter  on 27.7.1995, passed a resolution to reduce  the sanctuary  limit  to  444.23 Sq.K.M.  and make the  area  of 321,56  Sq.K.M.  rich with minerals like limestone, lignite, bauxite,  and  bentonite.  available for the development  of the  said backward area of Kutchh District.  The  resolution was  passed  in exercise of the powers conferred by  Section 26A(3)  of  the  Wild Life Protection Act.  Pursue  to  that resolution  the  Government  issued a notification  Lo  that effect en 9.8.1995.   The  petitioner   again  chalienged  those http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 notification by filing the writ a petition. The  High Court, after scrutinising the resolution was of  the  view  that ""the State Legislature was  quite  aware about  the  wild  life as without in any  way  diluting  the commitment to protect wild Life and to Improve the -habitat. positive  steps are taken so neither wiidUfe is affected nor the  improvement is affected."" The High Court heid that  for about  12QO Chinkaras the area of 444.23 Sq.K.M.  was  quite surfidsnt.   It further has that econom’c development of the araa  was likely to banefit the people of Kutchh District at large  and help in protection, preservation and  development of  flora and fauna of that area.

" O R D E R The report  of the  Registry indicates that the service is complete.  However ,  the respondents  are not  appearing either in person or through counsel Leave granted. The question  limited to  the  notice  is  whether  the respondent would  be entitled to payment of salary under the Grant-in-Aid Scheme  from the  date of  initial  appointment till he  improved his  qualification or from the date of his acquiring the  qualification? The  admitted position is that respondent No.1  came to be appointed as a lecturer in 1978. The Government  issued clarification  on January 5,1987 that unqualified lectures  having minimum  second class, i.e. 48% or above  and below  54% of  marks in  P.G. examination  and appointed on  or after 1.8.1977 in recognised non-Government Collates would  be eligible  to  receive  grant-in-aid.  The Resolution dated  September 13,1983 issued by the Government prescribes the  qualifications for  recruitment on Lecturers of affiliated  colleges which indicates that "" candidate not holding an M. Phil degree should possess a high second class Master’s  degree,   i.e.,  54%  marks  and  a  second  class Honours/pass   in    the   B.A/B.Com./B.Sc.    examination."" Respondent No.1  secured  53.9%    marks,  which  is  almost equivalent of  54% marks  on July  10, 1987.  Therefore, the question arises,  whether the  second respondent is entitled to receive  grant-in-aid for  payment of salary to the first respondent from,  the date of his acquiring qualification or from the date of initial appointment?  Admittedly, since the first respondent  on the  date of  his appointment  was  not possssing the  requisite qualification and acquired the same only on July 10, 1987, he will be eligible to the benefit of the grant-in-aid w.e.f. August 1,1987 and onwards . The appeal  is accordingly allowed and the order of the High Court  Passed on  April 23,1996  in OJC No. 3548/96, to that extent stands modified.

Meena Kumari,  filed the impugned writ petition in the High Court praying for a writ of mandamus directing the appellant, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, to grant her a licence for retail outlet/petrol pump in village Jheenjhak, district Kanpur Dehat, in pursuance of the Notification dated 30.12.1977. 4.      The writ petitioner is a resident of village Jheenjhak, district Kanpur Dehat and is a war widow whose husband was an army personnel who died during the 1971 war.

One of the terms mentioned in the policy guidelines for selection of dealers/distributors of 1977 was that preference would be given to the candidate belonging to the district in which the proposed dealership/distributorship is advertised. 6.      In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the High Court was right in directing that respondent No. 1 Smt. Meena Kumari should have been given preference and granted the licence for the petrol pump.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises form the order of the Orissa  administrative Tribunal  made on  September  13, 1991 in  T.A. No.  302/86. The admitted position is that the appellant was appointed as a Veterinary Extension Officer on 10.10.1958. Thereafter  in 1965, he was posted as Supervisor in Milk  Service Scheme  at Rourkela as In-charge of animals stationed at  Khapuria. In 1969 also, he was posted as Dairy Overseer. The appellant claimed to have been promoted to the rank of  Dairy Supervisor  on 26.11.1969  and was  posted as Farm Manager in District Livestock breeding Farm. He claimed that he is entitled to equal pay for equal work form 1969 to 1974 and  from   1974 to  1977 as  Form Manager.  It  is  an admitted position  that in  1977, he  obtained B.V.S. degree and on his securing the degree he was given the pay-scale of Rs.525-975/- applicable  to Class  ii  Gazetted  scale  from 1.7.77. Farm  Manager is  Class ii  post. The  Tribunal  has pointed out  in the order that though the Farm Manager is an inter- changeable   post,  it is not an intermediary between Gazette cadre  and the immediate post held by the appellant. It has  pointed out  that in  the Diary  Department of Dairy wing.  the   service  consists   of  Dairy  Overseer,  Dairy Supervisor and  Dairy Inspector  last of which is equivalent to Gazetted  post. The  Farm Manager  post is  held by  both Class II  and Class I officers depending upon the exigencies of the post. Shri  Misra,   learned  counsel   for  the   appellant, contended that  the  High  Court  in  writ  petition  O.J.C. No.1189/73 and  other matters had held that the Farm Manager post is  an intermediary  post for promotion to the Gazetted cadre. Al  persons who hold that post are entitled  to equal pay. That  order came to be final by dismissal of the SLP by this Court. Consequently, the appellant having held the post of a  Farm Manager is entitled to equal pay. In the counter- affidavit field  in the  Tribunal as  well as in this Court, the Government  has pointed that the holders of the post are http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 having different  scale of pay. Mere exigency of holding the post as  a Farm  Manager do not per se entitle the incumbent to the  same scale  of pay  which was  not admissible to the person who  held the post as Dairy Supervisor. It is pointer out that  the scale  of pay varies according to the gazetted or non-Gazetted  cadre. In  paragraph   7  of  the  counter- affidavit filed  in this  Court, They  have  reiterated  the distinction between the various posts held by the persons in the farm  branch and  Dairy branch. Merely because the posts are  inter-changeable   as  Farm   Manager,  they   do   not automatically become  entitled to  be the holder of the post and for  the same  scale of  pay. The  meet of the matter is that scales  of pay  are different  and direction  to  grant equal pay  is to allow the meet of the matter is that scales of pay  are different and direction to grant equal pay is to allow the  appellant to  jump the queue and land in a higher ladder. The  Tribunal, Therefore,  was right  in refusing to grant the  same scale  of pay to the appellant on the day on which he  was not entitled as per his seniority. Though Shri Misra contended  that the appellant was promoted to the post of a Farm Manager, we do not find any acceptable material on record to  conclude that  he was  holding Class  II Gazetted post own  right. Under these circumstances, the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be used as a shield to reach higher cadder  of service    in  accordance  with  rules  of promotion and  seniority. The  Tribunal is well justified in distinguishing the judgment of the High Court not giving the same benefit. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

This rule  has come  into force,  as stated earlier,  w.e.f March  1, 1972.  The  respondent  has voluntarily retired on March 20, 1970 and since then, he has already joined another institution. The view of the Tribunal that he  is entitled  to pension  on completing  25 years of qualifying service  applying the  aforesaid G.O., is clearly illegal. It  cannot be  given retrospective effect. However, since the  respondent had  rendered two  years of  temporary service and  there  is  a  short-fall  of  three  years  for computing the  pension, Government  is  at  liberty  and  is accordingly directed  to consider  his case  whether  he  is eligible  in   accordance  with   appropriate  procedure  to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 pensionary benefits  or relaxation  may be  given  and  pass appropriate orders  within a  period of four months from the date of receipt of the order.

" J  U  D  G  M  E   N  T RAJENDRA  BABU,  J.  : These appeals arise out of an order made by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Madras Bench [hereinafter referred to as  the Administrative Tribunal]  in which the selection against  30% quota for the post of Assistant Controller of Stores in the Stores Department of the Southern Railway through limited Departmental Competitive Examination held in June  1994 was challenged on the  ground that no reservation for Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe had been made as required. The Railway Board had instructed by its letter sent on 16.6.1992 that while computing the reserved quota such of the employees belonging to the said class already in the grade had to be taken and if it was more than the prescribed percentage, no reservation shall be provided  and if such quota was less, reservation must be provided.  A clarification was subsequently issued on 29.7.1993 to the effect that Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates who have been promoted on their own merit and seniority should not be counted as reserved candidates  and this has been the declaration of law made by this Court in R.K. Sabharwal & Ors.   vs.   State of Punjab & Ors., 1995 (2) SCC 745, and Union of India & Ors.   vs.  Virpal Singh Chauhan & Ors.,  1995 (6) SCC 684.   However, in the selections made by the second respondent the requisite number of posts had not been reserved for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates.   Out of  7 posts at least 2 posts should have been reserved for them which was available against 30% quota.  Therefore, the Administrative Tribunal gave certain directions to off-set the imbalance caused by the wrong application of the instructions issued by the Railway Board.     Thus the view stated by the Administrative Tribunal appears us to be correct and calls for no interference. However, in the application of the decision certain factors will have to be taken note of in the present case.  The appellants have been selected quite sometime back and the first appellant has been promoted to a higher grade.  The appellants were not responsible for the wrong computation of vacancies done by the second respondent.  After the empanelment and appointment of the appellants, it is brought to our notice that  there have been fresh promotions to the post of Assistant Controller of Stores at least on two occasions in June, 1995 and May, 1997.  In a new selection 5 Scheduled Caste candidates and 4 Scheduled Tribe candidates have been selected. The appellants could not participate in the same as they had already been promoted to the higher grade. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Now, when the appellants have been working in the higher grade from 1994 onwards, it would not be equitable to disturb their promotions. However,  the second respondent will have to enlarge the panel in order to accommodate two more candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in the next recruitment that may take place and appropriate seniority be given to suitable candidates whether already promoted or now to be promoted with effect from 17.8.1994 when the first appellant was promoted as Assistant Controller of Stores.  In such an event equity would stand balanced. Therefore,  while upholding the order made by the Administrative Tribunal which is consistent with the view taken by this Court in several decisions, including R.K. Sabharwal & Ors.  vs.   State of Punjab & Ors. (supra) and  Union of India & Ors.   vs.  Virpal Singh Chauhan & Ors. (supra), we direct as stated above. The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

Priyanka Biswas and others from the Court of Family Judge, Barasat, Distt. 24 Pargana, West Bengal to the Court of Family Judge, Ara, Bihar. The Respondent has remained absent even though served. The Petitioner claims that she was kidnapped from Ara Distract in Bihar by the Respondent and five others while she was returning from the college for admission in B.A. Part III.  The Petitioner claims that she was forcibly taken to Chandanpada Nadia in West Bengal and that thereafter a ransom of Rs.4,00,000/- was claimed from her family members.   The Petitioner further claims that under threat of death her signatures were taken before the Registrar of Marriages purportedly to show that she was married to the Respondent.   She claims that she managed to run away from the custody of the Respondent and had come to her parental house and has now received summons of the Matrimonial Suit.  She claims that there is a serious threat and apprehension of causing bodily injury or death if she has to go to West Bengal.  She further claims that her father is a very old man and cannot travel with her and that she is a young girl and cannot travel alone.   It is also claimed that she does not have sufficient money to go to West Bengal and to engage counsel over there. None of the above averments has been refuted by the Respondent.   We therefore accept all the averments to be true.   The grounds set out above are, in our view, sufficient to transfer the Matrimonial Case No. 466 of 2004.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5880/2000 WITH CIVIL APPEAL No. 5879/2000 HARJIT  SINGH BEDI,J. 1.      This appeal has been preferred by the Bihar State Board of Religious Trusts etc. impugning the judgment of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court dated 27.9.1991 quashing the Notification dated 5.8.1989 issued under sub- section (2) of Section 29 of the Bihar State Board Religious Trust Act, 1950 (hereinafter called the ""Act"") whereby the committee said to have been constituted on the basis of the trust deed dated 26.9.1983. 2.      It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants herein that the requisite notice under sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Act had been issued to the committee prior to its supersession and as such the impugned judgment holding to the contrary was not correct.  We however find that the notice given to the committee proposing supersession is a composite one under section 29(2) and section 32 of the Act. The High Court has found that the said Notification (Annexure-3) dated 5th August 1989 was not in accordance with the provisions or in terms of section 29 of the Act and did not also meet the parameters of the scheme which have been formulated later under section 32.  It had also come during the course of the hearing before the High Court that Civil Suit No. 207/1986 seeking a declaration, inter-alia, that the trust deed dated 26th September 1983 was a void document as well as several other issues was pending trial.  The Division Bench opined that as the matter was sub-judice before the Civil Court it would not be necessary or appropriate to go into the questions raised before the Civil Court but in so far as the aforesaid Notification was concerned it having been issued under section 29(2) of the Act without giving a proper hearing to the committee and the scheme under section 32 of the Act being not in accordance with law was liable to be quashed.  It is in this situation, the present appeals have been filed by the Board. 3.      We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record and in particular the notices allegedly given to the committee before its supersession as also the scheme framed under section 32 of the Act.  We note the finding of the High Court that there was no evidence to show that the notices had been served under section 29(2) cannot be seriously challenged.  We also find  that Civil Suit with regard http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to the validity of the trust is pending in the Civil Court.  We accordingly dismiss the appeals but while doing so direct that the status quo as exists today will continue till the disposal of the appeals.  We also direct that a fresh show cause notice under section 29(2) will be given to the committee and both parties will be at liberty to produce their documents before the Board within four months from the date of the service of the notice and that status-quo as exists today will continue to operate till the final disposal of the matter by the Board in proceedings under section 29(2) of the Act. 4.

" O R D E R Heard   the  counsel   on  both   sides.  The  entire prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence. According to  the  prosecution,  the  appellant  was  acquainted  with deceased Smt.  Shanti Devi.  On the intervening night of May 1/2, 1986, the appellant had gone to the hut of the deceased when she was alone and murdered for gain. The  circumstances to  connect the  appellant with the crime are  that (1)  PW  18,a  hotel  clerk,  had  seen  the appellant at  mid-night on  May 1, 1986 in the neighbourhood of the  scene of  offence; (2)  injury on  the finger of the appellant; (3) extra-judicial confession said to have been a made to  PW 13  on May 2, 1986; and (4) statement made under s.27 of  the Evidence  Act (Ext. P-8) leading to recovery of gold ornaments  of the  deceased from the shop of the father of the appellant spoken to by PW 22, the mediator. We have  carefully seen  the evidence  of PW 13 to whom the  appellant   is  alleged   to  have  made  extrajudicial confession. He admitted that the appellant had for the first time taken  him in  a scooter.  He did not know the names of the father  and the  relation of  the appellant and had gone with the  appellant to  the Tankbund, where the appellant is claimed to have made extra-judicial confession. The evidence does not  inspire confidence as, according to PW. 13, though he had  gone near  the dead body and found some person there he did not disclose the alleged confession to anyone at that time. Police too was seen near the dead body, but he did not tell them  about it,  nor  about  the  availability  of  the appellant at  that time.  No ostensible  reason was given to take PW.13  into confidence  to confess  the crime. judicial confession under s.164 was not recorded. PW.22, the recovery witness practically admitted in the cross-examination that  he had been taken to the appellant’s father’s shop.  His shop was opposite to the police station. He volunteered,  at the instance of the Sub-Inspector, to go to  the  place  for  recovery.  From  the  tenor  of  cross- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 examination and  the answers given by him, it would be clear that he  did not know the place of recovery. The other panch witness was  not examined to corroborate his evidence. It is hard to accept the uncorroborated sole testimony of PW.22 to believe the recoveries said to have been made. If  these two  pieces of  evidence are  excluded  from evidence,  no  other  unimpeachable  evidence  is  there  to connect the  appellant with the crime punishable under s.302 I.P.C. inasmuch  as the circumstances of the presence of the appellant near  the scene  of occurrence,  at the mid-night, and an  injury on  his finger  are too  weak to form a chain strong enough  to tie  the  appellant  with  so  serious  an offence as  murder. So,  we hold  that the  prosecution  has failed to  establish the  case against  the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt. Even  with  regard  to  offence  under  s.380,  if  the evidence of  PW.22 is  excluded, which  has to  be done  for reason already  alluded, it  would be  difficult to  sustain this  conviction  and  it  is  accordingly  set  aside.  The recovered ornaments of the deceased shall be returned to her son. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The appellant will be set  at liberty  and shall  be released  forthwith unless required in any other case.",The entire prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.520 OF 2008 [Arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.18158 of 2005] Leave granted. This appeal has been filed by the claimant-landholder. Land Acquisition Officer (LAO) awarded compensation at the rate of Rs.3000/- per bigha. In addition, solatium @ 10%  and interest @ 6% p.a. was also awarded by the LAO.  On reference, the Reference Court determined the potential value of the land at the rate of Rs.1/- per sq.ft. and accordingly determined the value of the land at Rs.85,500/- . Out of the said amount, 40% of the amount, viz., Rs.34200/- was deducted towards development charges.  Thus, an amount of Rs.51,300/- came to be awarded as compensation.  However, the Reference Court, instead of granting solatium at the rate of 30% and statutory interest, maintained the solatium and interest granted by the LAO. Appellant-claimant filed an appeal before the High Court  in which he did not challe nge the amount of compensation awarded.  Only  challenge was  for  enhancement  of solatium and C.A.No.520/08 .... (Contd.) - 2 - interest.  Appellant claimed solatium at the rate of 30% and interest at the rate of 15% p.a.  The High Court partly allowed the appeal and increased the solatium @ 30% but maintained the interest @ 6% p.a. Claimant, being aggrieved, has filed this appeal for enhancement of interest. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the courts have erred in granting interest at the rate of 6% p.a.  There is no reason for not awarding interest at the rate provided under the Statute.  That there was no discretion with the court to award interest at a rate lower than what was provided under the Statute. We agree with the contention raised by the counsel for the appellant and accordingly , modify the judgment of the High Court and direct that the appellant be paid statutory interest at the rate of 9% p.a. for the first year and thereafter at the rate of 15% p.a.

" O R D E R Leave granted. These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the Punjab  & Haryana  Court made on 31.3.1994 in Civil Writ Petition  No.   15044/93  and  1575/94.  The  appellant  was recruited as  a Constable  in Haryana Police service against sports quota  on September 15, 1977. He was promoted as Head Constable on July 4, 1984 keeping in view his performance in the sports.  He was  also confirmed  as a  Head Constable on August 31,  1987. He  was served with a show cause notice by Superintendent of  Police dated August 11, 1988 as to why he should not  be de-confirmed  as Head Constable w.e.f. August 31,  1987.  In  the  meanwhile,  he  was  also  promoted  as Assistant Sub-Inspector  on ad  hoc basis  on  November  22, 1990. While he was continuing as Assistant Sub-Inspector, he was provisionally  selected to  underso intermediate  school course which was to commence from September 15, 1993. He was selected and  sent for the training. While the appellant was undergoing the  training his  name was deleted from the list of Head Constables. Consequently, after unsuccessful attempt by representations,  the appellant  filed the  Writ Petition No.1575/94 in the High Court challenging the validity of the second show  cause notice  dated December  14, 1993.  It was dismissed by  the High  Court by order dated March 31, 1994. The other  writ  petition  challenging  de-confirmation  was dismissed. Thus, these appeals by special leave. In view  of the admitted position that he was recruited under the  sports quota  and also  promoted thereunder,  his promotion is  according to rules. The controversy raised was considered by  this Court  in  Rishal  Singh  vs.  State  of Haryana &  Ors. [JT  1992 (2)  SC 157].  It was held therein that though the order indicated that the promotion was on ad hoc basis,  but in  view of  Rule 13.1(1) of Chapter XIII of the Punjab  Police Rules,  1934  as  is  applicable  to  the Haryana State  the promotion  given to  the appellant  was a regular promotion  and it cannot be considered to be ad hoc. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 As a consequence, he was held to be entitled to confirmation in that position. In view of the above legal position we are of the  view that  the appellant  is entitled to the regular promotion. The appeals  are accordingly allowed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Division  Bench of  the High  Court of  Bombay in Appeal No.565/92 made on march 3, 1995. The admitted facts are that the appellant  claimed to  have purchased  the disputed site from one  A.M. Patil  in 1965 and constructed sheds thereon. He also alleged to have had a lease from him. On that basis, he claimed that the structure was existing prior to April 1, 1992. The  respondents issued  notice to  the appellant  for demolition. The  Deputy Municipal  Commissioner initially by order dated  January 27,  1983 directed him to retain a shed admeasuring 30""  x 30"" but other structures were directed to be demolished.  After 5  years, notice  was  issued  to  the appellant  to  demolish  that  shed.  Calling  the  same  in question, the  appellant filed  the writ  petition. In  Writ Petition No.1375/88,  the learned single Judge had held that the exercise of the power of review should be made bona fide within a  reasonable time. After considerable lapse of time, power of  review cannot be exercised. The Division Bench has set aside  the order  holding that  there is  no evidence on record to  show that the appellant had constructed the above structure prior to April 1, 1962. Under those circumstances, the appellant could not be permitted to retain the structure which was illegally constructed., It is sought to be contended for the appellant that the Additional Commissioner  has no  power to  review the  order passed by  a subordinate  officer on January 27, 1983 in the impugned order and, therefore, it is one of nullity. We find no force in the contention. It must he established as a fact that  the   appellant  has   title  to   the  property   and construction was  made bona  fide in  compliance  of  lawful permission or prior to April 1, 1962. It is an admitted fact that even  the lease  deed does  not contain  any recital as regards the  existence of  any  structure.  Learned  counsel http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 sought to  reply upon an order passed by the civil Court and also the  affidavit of  the lessor filed in 1966 to show the existence of the shed. It would be obvious that the shed was constructed after  April 1, 1962 as found by the High Court. Under  those   circumstances,  the   authority  was  rightly justified in  exercising that  power. We  do  not  find  any illegality in the order warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" J U D G M E N T KAPADIA, J. This is an appeal filed by the revenue under section 35-L (b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short ""the 1944 Act"") against the decision of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, Chennai (hereinafter referred to as ""the tribunal"") dated 28.2.2000 in Appeal Nos.E/Stat/77/2000 and E/122/2000, remanding the matter to the Commissioner (Appeals). M/s Akay Cosmetics (P) Ltd. (assessee herein) was the manufacturer of instant hair colour sold under the brand name ""Bigen"" falling under chapter sub-heading 3305.90 of the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985.  They were selling their entire production to M/s Nemaru Coiffure (for short ""M/s Nemaru"").  There was a dispute on the valuation of goods for the period 1/88 to 3/93.  The assessee had claimed deduction from the assessable value in respect of seven items of expenditure, namely, secondary packing, turnover tax, freight, insurance, octroi, handling charges and cost of bought-out items. By judgment and order dated 6.1.2000, the tribunal set aside the demand for differential duty raised by the department for the period 1/88 to 8/88 for want of show-cause notice.  By the said judgment, the tribunal allowed the assessees’ appeal claiming deduction for the aforestated seven items of expenditure for the period 9/88 to 3/91.  However, in view of the change in organizational set-up under agreement dated 2.1.1991, the tribunal remanded the matter to the Commissioner (Appeals) to reconsider the question of ""related person"" under section 4(4)(c) of the said Act for the period 4/91 to 3/93. Aggrieved by the decision of the tribunal dated 6.1.2000, the department came to this Court by way of  civil appeal under section 35-L(b) of the Act. By judgment delivered by this Court today in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Belgaum v. M/s Akay Cosmetics Pvt. Ltd. [Civil Appeal Nos.3792-3803 of 2000], this Court has partly allowed the department’s appeal.  However, the order of remand on the question of ""related person"" during the period 4/91 to 3/93 has been upheld. In the present appeal, 11 show-cause notices were issued by the department calling upon the assessee as to why the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 deduction in respect of the above seven items should not be disallowed for the period 4/93 to 6/97.  Since the question of ""related person"" had been remanded to Commissioner (Appeals) by the tribunal under its earlier order dated 6.1.2000, the dispute on the same point of ""related person"" for the period 4/93 to 6/97 was also required to be remanded to the Commissioner (Appeals).  In the circumstances, we do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment. Before concluding, we may point out that in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Belgaum v.  Akay Cosmetics (P) Limited reported in 2004 (167) ELT 253(T), it has been held that on and after 1.4.1991, the two entities, namely M/s Akay Cosmetics (P) Ltd. and M/s Nemaru were not related persons.

" JUDGMENT Dr. AR. Lakshmanan, J. Leave granted. The husband is the appellant before us. The respondent is his wife. They got married according to the Hindu rites and customs in the year 1972. After three years of marriage a daughter was born of the wedlock. Because of the misunderstanding between them the respondent started living separately from her husband from the year 1981 onwards and is working in the Social Forestry Department. The respondent also filed several criminal proceedings against her husband with which we are not concerned in this appeal. In the year 1989 the appellant filed a petition for a decree of dissolution of marriage on the ground of mental cruelty and the respondent having deserted him without any reasonable cause. The District Judge, Gwalior, dismissed the petition filed by the husband for dissolution of the marriage. The Appellant filed a first appeal in the High Court under Sec. 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The High Court also dismissed the appeal of the appellant. The appellant has therefore questioned the correctness of the order passed by the High Court in the above appeal. We heard Mr. A.K. Chitale, learned senior counsel and Mr. S.S.Dahiya, learned counsel for the respondent and perused the judgment passed by both the trial court and also of the High court. It is not in dispute that the respondent is living separately from the year 1981. Though the finding has been rendered by the High Court that the wife last resided with her husband up to 25.3.1989, the said finding according to the learned counsel for the appellant is not correct.  In view of the several litigations between the parties it is not possible for her to prosecute criminal case against the husband and at the same time continue to reside with her husband. In the instant case the marriage is irretrievably broken down with no possibility of the parties living together again. Both the parties have crossed 49 years and living separately and working independently since 1981. There being a history of litigation with respondent-wife repeatedly filing criminal cases against the appellant which could not be substantiated as found by the Courts. This apart, only child born in the wedlock in 1975 has already been given in marriage. Under such circumstances the High Court was not justified in refusing to exercise its jurisdiction in favour of the appellant. This apart, the wife also has made certain allegations against her husband, that the husband has already remarried and is living with another lady as stated by her in the written statement. The High Court also has not considered the allegations made by the respondent which have been repeatedly made and repeatedly found baseless by the courts. In our opinion it will not be possible for the parties to live together and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 therefore there is no purpose in compelling both the parties to live together. Therefore the best course in our opinion is to dissolve the marriage by passing a decree of divorce so that the parties who are litigating since 1981 and have lost valuable part of life can live peacefully in remaining part of their life. During the last hearing both the husband and wife were present in Court. Husband was ready and willing to pay lumpsum by way of permanent alimony to the wife. The wife was not willing to accept the lumpsum but however expressed her willingness to live with her husband. We are of the opinion that her desire to live with her husband at this stage and at this distance of time is not genuine. Therefore, we are not accepting this suggestion made by the wife and reject the same. In the result, the appeal filed by the husband stands allowed. There will be a decree of dissolution of marriage in favour of the husband. No costs.",The husband and wife got married according to the Hindu rites and customs in the year 1972. After three years of marriage a daughter was born of the wedlock. Because of the misunderstanding between them the respondent started living separately from the year 1981 onwards and is working in the Social Forestry Department. The respondent also filed several criminal proceedings against her husband.,appointment,31.4
" CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal  No.  1352  of 1970. Appeal by certificate from the judgment and order dated  7th day  of August 1967 of the Allahabad High Court  in  Special http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Appeal ’No. 94 of 1967. M.   C. Chagla, Suresh Sethi, R. K. Maheshwari, Maya Krishan :and B. P. Maheshwari, for the appellant. N. D. Karkhanis- and O. P. Rana, for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HEGDE, J.-This is- an appeal by certificate’ The only  ques- tion  that  arises  for decision  is  whether  groundnut  is oilseed.  The High Court has come to the conclusion that the groundnut  is  oilseed.  The question is ’to the  nature  of groundnut came up, for consideration in connection with  the levy  of  purchase-tax  on the  purchase  of  oilseed.   The assessee  in  this  case is a manufacturer of  oil  and  the assessee appears to have purchased groundnuts in 547 large  quantity  for the manufacture of oil.   He  contended before the assessing authorities as well as before the  High Court,  unsuccessfully, that groundnut is not  oilseed.   In support of that contention, he relied on the decision of the Madhya  Pradesh  High Court in Commissioner  of  Sales  Tax, Madhya  Pradesh, Indore v. Bakhat Rai & Co. (18 S.T.C.  285) and the decision of a single Judge of Punjab & Haryana  High Court  in  Hans  Raj Choudhri v. J.S.  Rajyana,  Excise  and Taxation  Officer  (19  S.T.C. 489).   These  two  decisions undoubtedly  ’support his contention.  The learned Judge  of the  Allahabad High Court have not accepted those  decisions as  laying  down the law correctly and we are  in  agreement with  the view taken by the learned Judges of the  Allahabad High Court.. The  petitioner in his Writ Petition has  definitely  stated that he purchased groundnuts mostly from cultivators for the manufacture  of  oil.   Hence  there is  no  doubt  that  he purchased groundnut for the purpose of manufacturing oil. We  shall  now proceed to consider  whether  groundnuts  are seeds and further whether they are oilseeds.  In finding out the  true meaning of term ""oilseeds"" found in the  Sales-tax law  in question, we are not to refer to  dictionaries.   We are  to  find  out  the meaning ascribed  to  that  term  in commercial  parlance.   See the decision of  this  Court  in Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Indore v. Jaswant Singh Charan Singh (19 S.T.C. 469).  There can hardly be any doubt  that in commercial. circles Ground nut is dealt  with as oilseed.  The commercial journals and newspapers  while quoting the market price of oilseeds list groundnuts as  one of the species of oilseeds.  From this, it is clear that  in commercial circles groundnut is treated as oilseed. A seed is one which germinates.  It is not disputed that the groundnut  germinates.  Hence it is undoubtedly  seed.   The next   question  is  whether  it  is  generally   used   for manufacture  of  oil.  Here again, there can hardly  be  any doubt that groundnut is Mostly. used for the manufacture  of groundnut oil which is used in the manufacture of Dalda  and other cooking media.  Groundnut is one of the items which is mostly  used in this country for the manufacture of  cooking media. In  our opinion, both the Madhya Pradesh High Court and  the Punjab  &  Haryana High Court ’were wrong in  holding  that’ groundnut is not oilseed. For  the reasons mentioned above, this appeal  is  dismissed with costs. G.C.                              Appeal dismissed. 548",Groundnut oil is used in the manufacture of Dalda media which is mostly used in cooking media. The High Court has come to the conclusion that the groundnut  is  oilseed.,civil,24.14

" J U D G M E N T ARIJIT PASAYAT,J. The State of Andhra Pradesh is in appeal against the judgment of learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh allowing the writ petition filed by the respondents.  By the impugned judgment it was held that the proceedings initiated against the respondents in seizing molasses along with tanker while in transit and confiscating the same is without any authority of law.  The High Court accepted the plea that there was no material to show that the seized articles were intended to be used for manufacturing of rectified spirit. In support of the appeal, learned counsel appearing for the State of Andhra Pradesh submitted that the High Court’s approach is clearly erroneous.  This was not a case where there was no material to show the commission of alleged crime.  Whether there was adequate material already in existence or which could have been collected during investigation and their relevance is essentially a matter of trial. Per contra, learned counsel for the accused-respondents submitted that on mere surmises and conjectures that the molasses being transported was intended to be used for the purpose of manufacturing illicit distilled liquor. Suspicion however strong cannot be a ground to initiate criminal proceedings thereby unnecessarily harassing the innocent transporters.  It was further pointed out that the High Court has merely directed release of the tanker as well as the molasses and criminal proceedings have not been quashed. Similar question came up for consideration before this Court in a batch of cases, in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Goloconda Linga Swamy and Anr. (2004 AIR SCW 4329). In those cases FIRs. filed were quashed by exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Code’). This Court set aside High Court’s judgment. In the present case, like the aforesaid batch of cases, the statement of the driver of the vehicle and the Panchnama show that there was some material to proceed against the respondents.    Obviously, the acceptability of the materials to fasten guilt on the accused is a matter of trial.  This cannot be said to be a case where commission of offence was not disclosed. Stand of the learned counsel for the respondents-accused that the prayer in the writ petition was for release of the vehicle and the seized articles is clearly untenable.  In fact, the High Court has clearly noted that the prayer was to quash the entire proceedings and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 additionally for release of the seized tanker and the articles. By the impugned judgment, the High Court has quashed the entire proceedings and has consequently directed release of the seized tanker and the molasses.  The operative part of the High Court’s order reads as follows: ""In view of the same, entire proceedings initiated by the respondents-authorities in seizing the molasses along with tanker while in transit and confiscating the same is without any authority or law and the same is accordingly set-aside.  Consequently, the respondents are directed to release the tanker as well as molasses, which was seized pursuant to the registration of Cr. No. 132/2002-2003 dated 30-8-2002 by the S.H.O. Zaheerabad."" Since the proceedings were held to be without authority of law, consequentially direction for release was given. No other reason has been given for directing release. Therefore, the High Court was not justified in quashing the entire proceedings. That being so, the direction for release of the tanker and the seized articles cannot be sustained. The proceedings shall revive and continue in accordance with law.  Whether the materials already on record and to be collected during investigation would substantiate the accusation is a matter of trial. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that an application shall be filed before the concerned Court for release of truck and the seized molasses. If such application is filed, the same shall be considered in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed.",The High Court accepted the plea that there was no material to show that the seized articles were intended to be used for manufacturing rectified spirit.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No.18642 of 2005) With CIVIL APPEAL NO.4283 of  2006 (Arising out of SLP (C) No.22044 of 2005) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the writ petition so far as it related to the present appellants while issuing notice to the other two writ petitioners. The High Court held that the present appellants are not entitled to the benefit in terms of Rule 3.8 of Police Training College Manual (in short the ’Manual’) and thus not entitled to grant of grace marks. As noted supra, in the case of co-writ petitioners notice was issued by the High Court. According to learned counsel for the appellants various submissions were made before the High Court which it did not notice and only on the ground that no benefit was available under Rule 3.8 of the Manual the writ petition was dismissed. Learned counsel for the respondent-State, however, supported the order of the High Court. So far as claim of different submissions made by the appellants as is clear from a bare reading of the writ petition they were essentially as follows: ""(i)    That action of the respondents is contrary to the Police Training College Manual wherein four chances have been provided and services of the petitioners are being terminated only after granting two chances. (ii)    That the petitioners were not even allowed to complete their one year http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 training as per Rules. Rather first examination was conducted when they have only completed 9 months training. (iii)   That even sufficient time was not granted to the petitioners when 2nd time examination was conducted. (iv)    That earlier also many chances have been given to pass the examination. Even opportunity was granted to pass the training fresh to many candidates. (v)     That to discharge the petitioners only after granting two opportunities is on the face of it arbitrary and illegal. (vi)    That the course was very lengthy and there was no proper instructors to teach the law subjects and even the examinations were conducted without completing the full, one year training."" The writ petition was dismissed so far as the present appellants are concerned at the admission stage. No notice had been issued and no counter affidavit had been filed. The stand of learned counsel for the State is that various stands highlighted by the appellant in the writ petition are clearly unsustainable in law. A bare reading of the High Court’s order shows that it did not consider the various stands of the appellants. It also did not mention that no other point except that relating to Rule 3.8 of the Manual was pressed into service. Had it been so, the grievance of the appellants would have been without any basis. But the High Court did not even refer to the various stands taken by the appellants. It was open to the High Court to discard the plea but to restrict consideration to one point and not to others was certainly not a permissible course. It may be, as contended by learned counsel for the State, that different pleas as raised are without any substance. But that should have been clearly indicated in the impugned order. That having not done so, we set aside the order of the High Court and remand the case to it for a fresh disposal in accordance with law.  Since the counter affidavit has not been filed by the respondents before the High Court, let them do so within a period of four weeks. Since the matter is of some urgency the High Court is requested to decide the writ application as early as possible preferably by the end of December, 2006. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion so far as acceptability or otherwise of the stands taken by the writ petitioner nos.1 and 2 and/or the acceptability of various stands as noted above taken by present appellants. The appeals are allowed. There will be no order as to costs.","The High Court held that the present appellants are not entitled to the benefit in terms of Rule 3.8 of Police Training College Manual.

No.8654/95. The admitted  position is that though lease was granted to the  appellants on  December 5, 1994 for one year and was executed, as  admitted by the respondents, on the said date, it expired  on December  5, 1995.  It is  contended that the lease  granted  to  the  appellants  was  cancelled  by  the Commissioner on February 17, 1995 and on a revision filed by the appellants  to the State Government by order dated March 23, 1995,  the order  of the Commissioner was set aside. But unfortunately the  operation of  the order of the Government was stayed  by the  High Court  on May  21, 1995  and it set aside the  order of the Government by the impugned order. It is not in dispute that pursuant to the direction of the High Court the  auctions were  conducted and  third parties  have been inducted  to work  out the  excavation of the sand; but they are  not before  us. Though  there is some force in the argument of  the learned  counsel for  the  appellants  that since the  working of the period of the lease granted to the appellants was  not allowed  to be fully utilised on account of the  orders passed by the courts or the Commissioner, the time may be extended for the appellants to execute the lease and work  out the  lease for  the residue  period, as stated earlier, since  the third  party rights  have  already  been intervened, in their absence we cannot give the direction as sought for.  Under these  circumstances, it is stated in the affidavit itself that the respondent-Government have offered refund of the amount deposited by the appellants as directed by the  High Court.

" J U D G M E N T O R D E R The appellant herein was in employment as lecturer in Geology in Hyderabad \026 Karnataka Education Society’s Engineering College, Gulbarga, which is a government aided institution.  He remained in that capacity from 6th July, 1962 to 20th January, 1971.  Subsequently, on 22nd of January, 1971, the appellant was selected and appointed as a Geologist in the Government Department of Mines & Geology through a positive act of selection by the Public Service Commission, Karnataka.  The appellant retired from service on 29th February, 1996.  The service conditions and the grant of pensionary benefits are governed by the Karantaka Civil Service Rules, 1958.  These Rules have been amended from time to time.  The appellant, after retirement, wrote to the Principal Secretary of Government of Karnataka, Department of Commerce & Industries for counting his past service rendered by him in the government aided institution for the purpose of counting qualifying service for settling his pensionary benefits.  The respondent calculated the pension of the appellant in terms of amended Rule 248 of the aforesaid Rules.  Aggrieved by the said decision the appellant filed a petition before the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal and the same was rejected.  A writ petition filed against that order met with the same fate.  It is against that order the appellant has come before this Court by way of special leave. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of either unamended Rule 247A or Rule 248, whichever is more beneficial to him.  In the present case, it is found that the appellant is entitled to have the benefit of unamended Rule 247A of the Karnataka Civil Service Rules, 1958.  In fact the appellant was within his rights to claim the benefit of unamended Rule 247A.  The counsel for the appellant states that the appellant will claim the benefit of only additional 11 months and 20 days rounded-off to one year, and in total three years.  We, therefore, direct that if the appellant moves an application in aforestated terms to the respondent within one month for fixation of his pension, the respondent will consider the application within a period of three months after the filing of the application by the appellant, in accordance with law.

He was not  appointed to  the post  of Lecturer  in Opthomology Department of  Jammu & Kashmir. He sought a writ of mandamus in W.P.  No. 458/94.  Pending disposal of the writ petition, certain directions  seems to  have been  issued by  the High Court and for its non-compliance, the above order came to be passed. For  his entitlement  to be  appointed to  the  post pursuant  to  the  selection  made  by  the  Public  Service Commission, Dr.  Ashok Kumar  Kohli has taken the stand that the select  list had not lapsed while the Government’s stand is that  the list  stood lapsed with the expiry of one year. Since the  writ petition  is pending,  we are not expressing any opinion  on merits.  Suffice it  to say  that since  the controversy is yet to be decided, perhaps the High Court may not be justified in calling upon the Government to implement the interim  direction.

At the time of issuing notice to the special leave petition, this Court confined notice as to why the second appeal should not be remitted to the High Court for failure to formulate and decide the substantial question of law as required by Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 3.      A suit was filed by the plaintiffs-respondents for declaration that Item No.2 of the plaint schedule property was their absolute property, and for a perpetual injunction, restraining the respondents from obtaining possession of the said item. The suit was dismissed, which was affirmed in appeal. However, by the impugned judgment of the High Court passed in second appeal, the suit was decreed. Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad, a special leave petition has been filed in respect of which leave has already been granted. 4.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after examining the judgment of the High Court passed in the second appeal, we are of the view that the judgment in second appeal of the High Court is liable to be set aside on a very short question. It is now well settled by catena of decisions of this Court that the High Court in second appeal, before allowing the same, ought to have formulated the substantial questions of law and thereafter, to decide the same on consideration of such substantial questions of law. In this case, admittedly no such substantial question of law had been formulated and thereafter, the second appeal was allowed. That being the position, we set aside the judgment of the High Court passed in second appeal and remit the appeal back to the High Court for fresh decision after formulating the substantial questions of law and thereafter, to decide it on merits. 5.      For the reasons aforesaid, the judgment of the High Court is set aside. The second appeal is restored to its original file. The High Court is requested to dispose of the second appeal at an early date preferably within six months from the date of supply of a copy of this order to it. We make it clear that we have not gone into the merits of the appeal which shall be decided after formulating the substantial questions of law and then to decide the second appeal in accordance with law. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 6.

" P. Venkatarama Reddi, J. On the date of the conclusion of hearing in the batch of  Special Leave Petitions this Court passed an order  allowing the interlocutory applications for permission to file special leave petitions and for condonation of delay in all the matters.  However, on an examination of the file in this particular case, it is noticed that this case stands on a different footing and the permission need not be granted.

Accordingly, the following order is passed herein : Permission to file SLP is refused to the petitioners because they are questioning the judgment in relation to the appointments to the posts of teachers in Zila Parishad, whereas petitioners applied for and participated in the selection for the posts of Gram Sewaks.  In fact, as far as Gram Sewaks are concerned, there is a separate judgment of the High Court in S.B.

This application has been filed by the appellant \026 Bank for correction of factual submission  No. 1 recorded at internal page 4 of the judgment of this Court dated 12.01.2007. 3.      In the judgment dated 12.01.2007, this Court recorded three submissions made by Shri Raju Ramachandran, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of applicant \026 bank.  The first submission as recorded in the judgment was, \023pension regulations do not apply to the respondent No. 1 as he is an award staff\024.  This submission appears to have been mistakenly mentioned in the judgment dated 12.01.2007 and it needs to be suitably corrected to the extent that \023there was no scheme/provision of voluntary retirement in the terms and conditions of service applicable to the award staff to which respondent No. 1 belonged. 4.      The rectification of the above said submission is essential because this factual mistake has been recorded in the judgment as a submission of the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant \026 bank due to oversight. The applicant \026 bank in this application has categorically submitted that the pension regulations are applicable to all employees of the bank irrespective of whether they are officers or award staff. 5.      Thus, in the factual situation as noticed above, the first submission recorded in the judgment dated 12.01.2007 shall stand rectified and corrected to the above extent which shall form part of the main judgment.  We may make it clear that this order of change/rectification of the factual mistake of first submission noticed in the judgment will have no bearing or effect on the final result of the appeal which was decided on other issues and contentions on merits. 6.

" THE 26TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Present; Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Hon’ble Mr.Justice B.N. Kirpal P.P.  Malhotra,   Sr.Adv.  B.B.Sawheny,   Vineet   Malhotra, Shailendra Sharma,  Ms. Sandhya  Goswami, Advs. with him for the  appellant. K.C. Kaushik, Adv. for D.S.Mehra, Adv. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI, J. The  appellant  has  been  convicted  for  the  offence punishable under  Section 9  of the  Suppression of  Immoral Traffic Act.   He  challenged his  conviction by  filing  an appeal before  the Sessions  Court, which was dismissed.  he then preferred  and appeal to the High Court, which was also dismissed. In this  case, initially,  this Court had issued notice only with respect to ground No.7 raised in the Special Leave Petition.    Therein  the  point  that  was  raised  by  the appellant was  the, in this case, the investigation was done by a  Sub-Inspector  of  Police  and  not  by  an  Assistant Commissioner  of  Police  appointed  for  that  purpose  and therefore the  whole investigation  was illegal  and on  the basis  of   the  material   collected  during  such  illegal investigation, the  appellant could not have been convicted. Apart from the fact that the contention is not sound in law, it is factually also incorrect.  The Sub-Inspector of Police after recording  statement of  the  complainant  called  the Assistant  Commissioner  of  Police  at  the  place  of  the incident.   The Assistant  Commissioner after reaching there recorded statements of other witnesses and also verified the statement of  the complainant.   It  was on the basis of the material  thus  collected  and  verified  by  the  Assistant Commissioner of Police that the FIR was recorded and further investigation was  carried on.  Therefore, it cannot be said the the  investigation made in this case was contrary to the provisions of  the Act.   This  appeal really deserves to be dismissed on that ground alone. The appellant  has also filed an application to enlarge http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the scope of the appeal and to permit the appellant to place on record  material in  the shape  of various FIRs and other police  records   to  show  that  the  complainant  and  the investigating officer  are not  creditworthy witnesses.   In the application,  the appellant  had only  referred to  such material and  later on, he produced copies of such material. They are  not certified  copies and,  therefore, we have not taken any  notice of  them.  Moreover, it will not be proper to  condemn   the  prosecution   witnesses  by   now  taking additional evidence,  in respect  of which they did not have any opportunity  to controvert.   We, therefore, reject that application. This appeal  is therefore, dismissed.  The appellant is directed to  surrender to  custody immediately  to serve out the remaining part of his sentence.","The appellant has been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 9 of the Suppression of  Immoral Traffic Act.

" J U D G M E N T (arising out of SLP(C) No.23168/2005) Dr. AR . Lakshmanan, J. Leave granted. Heard Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned Additional Solicitor General for the appellant-Union of India and Mr. Arun Jaitely, learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1. The appeal was filed by the Union of India through its Secretary, Ministry of Finance and the Director of Revenue Intelligence and two others questioning the correctness of the judgment passed by the High Court dated 14.10.2005.  The High Court while allowing the writ petition filed by respondent no.1 held that the action of the appellants herein in preventing respondent no.1 from operating its account was bad in law and the appellants could not have issued any direction under section 110(3) read with section 113(i) and section 121 of the Customs Act, 1962.  Consequently, the High Court has directed the second respondent Bank to release the account of respondent no.1 and permit operation thereof. In this appeal, several grounds have been raised by the Union of India questioning the legality and correctness of the orders passed by the High Court.  In view of the subsequent developments, we are not going into the questions of law raised and the merits in this appeal at this stage. It is stated by the learned Senior Counsel for respondent no.1 that the first respondent’s Bank Account  was freezed by the appellants herein on 30.7.2005.  The High Court passed the judgment in favour of respondent No.1 on 14.10.2005.   A sum of Rs.49,86,755.25 was seized by the appellants herein, which was in credit in the Bank Account of the first respondent with the second respondent.  It appears that the first respondent, between 15.10.2005 and 29.10.2005, has withdrawn a sum of Rs.49,09,712/- leaving a balance of Rs.75,043.25.  The appellant filed the special leave petition before this Court only on 28.10.2005.  This Court on 11.11.2005 granted interim stay till the matter is listed on due date. It is, thus, seen that the first respondent has withdrawn the amount in the Bank Account before the order of stay was passed by this Court.  In view of the withdrawal, the appeal filed by the appellants has become infructuous. However, we leave the question of law raised in this appeal open to be decided in an appropriate case.  It is also submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that in view of the withdrawal of the entire amount from the Bank Account, a fresh show cause notice was issued after the investigation was completed. It is for the appellant to proceed further in accordance with law. In view of the order now passed, there cannot be any order of seizure of the Bank Account by the appellants.  We, therefore, lift the orders of seizure made on 30.7.2005 and 5.8.2005 and the respondent No.1 is at liberty to operate the said Bank Account and the second respondent will permit the first respondent to operate the said Bank Account in view of the order now passed. The Appeal is accordingly allowed.  There shall be no orders as to costs.","The appeal was filed by the Union of India questioning the correctness of the judgment passed by the High Court dated 14.10.2005.

Balgopal Advs. for the Respondent O R D E R The following Order of the court was delivered : O R D E R Leave granted . This appeal by special leave arises from the  judgement and order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Ernakulam, made on 4.1.1996 in OA No.462 of  1995. The admitted  position is  that  the  respondent    was appointed as a veterinary doctor on a temporary  post in the pay-scale of  Rs.650-1200/- which  was  subsequently revised to  Rs.2000   3500/-.  After  closure  of  the  Dandakaranya Project, instead  of dismissing  him   from  service  as  an Administrative Officer, they adjusted  the respondent as per the  Deployment  of  Surplus  Staff  Rules.  Initially,  the respondent  was   allotted  to  the    Scheduled  Caste  and Scheduled Tribe  Commission on their  willingness to receive him, but  later on, he was not assigned any duty. On receipt of letter from the Commission, the responded was allotted to the Geological  Department as  an Administrative  Officer by offer dated 26.2.1987. The scale of pay therein also was the same  as   was  of   the  Administrative   Officer  in   the Dandakaranya Project,  viz., Rs.2000-3500/-.  He claimed the scale of  Rs.700-1300/ which  was  subsequently  revised  to Rs.2200-4000/-  The  Tribunal  has  directed  grant  of  the aforesaid relief.  It is  obvious that the scale of Rs.2200- 4000/- is  higher  scale  of  Assistant  Director  than  the Administrative Officer  to which  post  the  respondent  was appointed. On  deployment to  Geological Department,  he was actually  drawing   the  scale  of  pay.  His  service  were transferred to Geological Department, Dandakaranya Project. Learned counsel for the respondent contends that  since he was  given posting  as Assistant Director in the Schedule http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Caste and  Schedule Tribe  Commission and  he had  agreed to report to  join the  duty, the mere fact his that he was not assigned any  work, does  not take   away  his right  to the salary attached  to that  post. We  find no  force  in  this contention. Due  to the  letter addressed by the Commission, the Government  reallotted  him to the Geological Department as Administrative  Officer carrying  the same  scale of  pay drawn  by   him  in     Dandakranya   Project.  Under  these circumstance, the  view taken  by the  Tribunal  is  clearly illegal. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 17787/2006) Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Karnataka on March 28, 2005 in MFA No.1532 of 2001.  The High Court while disposing of the appeal observed in the order impugned in the present appeal that it was argued on behalf of the complainant that the property was situated in the heart of Bagalkot township.  The value of the area should be assessed at Rs.100/- per sq.ft.  The High Court also noted that according to the Government Advocate, reasonable rate would be Rs.16.25 per sq.ft. After noting the above two contentions of the respective parties, the High Court disposed of the matter by coming to the following conclusion: ""After considering the material and  argument, it is just and reasonable that the rate of vacant area per sq.ft. assessed at Rs.50/-.  The claimant is entitled to a compensation of Rs.1108250/- with necessary statutory benefits.  The compensation awarded :2: in respect of the structure is confirmed.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.""(Emphasis supplied) A bare reading of the above paragraph makes it clear that the High Court has disposed of the appeal on the basis of so called ""material"" and ""arguments""  that since the claim of the claimant was Rs.100/- per sq.ft.and the Government’s stand was Rs.16.25 per sq.ft., it would be \023just and reasonable\024 to award at the rate of Rs.50/- per sq.ft to the complainant. But there is no discussion of the ’material’ or ’arguments’ Without observing anything on the merits of the case, the appeal deserves to be allowed only on this ground.  The order of the High Court is set aside. No doubt, the learned counsel for the claimant contented that looking to the materia l which is on record, it is a fit case to award compensation at the rate of Rs.50/- per sq.ft.  But in view of the fact that the High Court has not considered the matter and passed a ’cryptic’ order, we remit the matter back to the High Court and request  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 High Court to dispose of the case as expeditiously as possible.

Her  request for transfer was accepted on certain terms  and conditions  stipulated  by the appellants and the same  were accepted  by the respondents.  One of the conditions of  the transfer  was that the respondent has to technically  resign from  the post which she was holding and she was to join  as direct  recruit to a lower post of Clerk in the pay scale of 950-1500.   On  acceptance  of   terms  and  conditions  the respondent  was  transferred  as a Clerk to  the  office  of Accountant  General,  Karnataka  at  Bangalore.   After  the transfer  to  a lower post her pay was erroneously fixed  at Rs.1250/-  per  month.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2029 OF  2008 (Arising out of SLP) No.19547 of 2006) 1.      Leave granted. 2.      In a partition suit filed by the respondents herein in the year 1987, a decree was p assed in favour of the respondents on 20.11.1992.  Aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order the father of the present appellants preferred a regular appeal in the High Court on 22.02.1993. He was the sole appellant.  On 06.07.2002, the father of the appellants died when the matter was pending consideration before the High Court.  This fact was brought to the notice of the High Court by the counsel for the respondents, and the High Court dismissed the First Appeal on 19.01.2005 as abated. 3.      An application was filed by the legal representatives of the deceased appellant on 01.05.2006 before the High Court setting aside abatement and bringing them on record along with an application for condonation of delay which was dismissed by the High Court. Hence the present appeal. 4.      It appears that the appeal was pending consideration before the High Court since 199 3 and the deceased was the sole appellant before the High Court.  It also appears that the legal representatives were not aware of the pendency of the appeal before the High Court and, therefore, they could not take steps for bringing them on record in the First Appeal within the stipulated time.  We also notice that the appeal  is arising out of a partition suit where b oth the parties are in the capacity of plaintiff as well as defendants.  Normally, the courts always lean towards the decision of the matter between the parties on merits and thus the sufficient cau se to  receive liberal construction so as to advance substantial justice. 5.      Taking an overall view of the facts into consideration and the fact that normally th e parties should be given a liberty to contest the matter on merits unless there is a gross callous negligence or deliberate inaction with the parties to protect trial, we are of the view that the interest of justice would be sub-served if the legal representatives are brought on record a nd the First Appeal No.1233 of 1993 is restored to its original number by setting aside abateme http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 nt.

Keeping in view  the fact that the mat ter is pending for a long time we would request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of the matter as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of 8 months from the date of receipt of the order. 6.

The Tribunal  in  the  impugned  order  made  on 22.11.1990 in  OA No.1383/90  directed interest  @ 7%    per annum for  the first  twelve months  and @ 10% per annum for the period  thereafter The  admitted position  is  that  the respondent was  unauthorisedly in  occupation of the quarter allotted to  him and  therefore, he  was not paid death-cum- retirement gratuity  since the  respondent had  remained  in possession unauthorisedly  for more  than  two  years.  This question was considered by this Court in Raj Pal Wahi & Ors. vs. Union  of India & Ors.

In this case, in view of  the circular issued by the administration directing not to  make payment  of death-cum-retirement  gratuity till the retired  employee surrenders  possession, the  delay  in payment was  not due  to any  administrative  lapse  but  on account of  the circular  issued by  the Board.

This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated March  10, 1993  of the  High Court  of Bombay. Nagpur Bench, in  C.R.A. No. 572 of 1992. From the record, it would appear that  one Ishwar Das Gajbi filed Civil Suit No. 89 of 1985 after  Civil Suit  No.  82/1983  for  eviction  of  the appellants was  filed. When  the suits  were  part-heard  on February 20, 1992, the counsel for the appellant reported no instructions under  exhibit 116. Consequently, they were set ex-parte. They filed application Order 9 Rule 13, CPC to set aside the ex-parte order, which the trial court dismissed by order April 27, 1992. On revision, it was confirmed. Shri  Sanghi,   learned  counsel  for  the  appellants, contended that  the appellants  were diligent in prosecuting the suits. The counsel had wrongly reported no instructions. There was  no delay  on their  part. The  appellants  had  a strong case  on merits.  Therefore, they  are entitled to be heard by setting aside the ex-parte order against them. The question  is  whether  the  appellants  have  given proper explanation  for their  failure to  appear before the Court on  February 20,  1992. Though  Shri Sanghi  contended that all  through they  were diligent  and  it  was  at  the instance of  the plaintiffs  that the  suits were dragged on and  that,   therefore,  no  blame  could  be  laid  on  the appellants’ door,  unfortunately, no  material was placed on the record  either in  the trial court or in the High Court, much less  in this  Court, to show that they were diligently http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 prosecuting the  suits. On  the other  hand, the trial court recorded that  the appellants, being in actual possession of the suit  property, were  intending to  prolong the  matter. There is  no  bona  fides  or  genuineness  for  their  non- appearance on February 20, 1992. It is then stated thus : ""It   is   also   important   that   the defendants are  indulging in  all  sense and spirits  to protract and prolong the progress of  the suit,  when it is filed in 1983  near about  9 years  have  been lapsed, but  no progress could have been achieved so far. The defendants no. 1 to 5 cannot be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong and they have absolutely no bonafide  to come  before  the  Court with a  case for  permission to  contest the present  suit claim. In other words, the  defendants  No.  1  to  5  are  not diligent in  contesting the  suit  claim and that,  resulted into  prolonging the suit and its decision. The suit is part- heard since last more than 3 years."" On these  findings, the  trial court  declined to allow the application  to set  aside the  ex-parte order. The High Court, having  had  the  discretion,  was  not  inclined  to interfere with the matter under Section 115, CPC. The question  is whether  this is  a fit cases for this Court to interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution. In view of the categorical finding recorded by the trial court, we think  that it  is not  an appropriate  case  for  us  to interdict and  put the  clock back  to further  prolong  the matter.

" JUDGMENT 1994(2) SCR 121 The following Order of the Court was delivered These appeals by Special leave arise from the Judgment of the High Court of Karnataka dated August 10, 1981 in Misc. Appeal Nos. 1406-1428/1981. The High Court following its earlier Judgment in Special Land Acquisition Officer, Hassan v. Mallesha M.S.,(1975) 2 Mysore Law Journal p.74, applying a multiplier of 15 years for the average annual income for Rs. 720 per acre upheld the fixation of the market value at Rs.800 per acre. Thus these appeals by Special Leave. Notification under Sec.4(l) dated March 13, 1980 was published in the State Gazette on July 24, 1980 acquiring 10 acres of land for Upper Krishana Project. The District Judge found from the evidence that the lands are madikattu lands and two dry crops of groundnuts in the first season, Jowar of cotton in the second rabi season were being raised in those lands. He determined the market value of the crop at Rs.720 after deducting the expenses incurred thereof. Though it is doubtful whether two crops could be raised in dry lands, under appeal ve proceed on the footing that the evidence adduced would show that in the lands under acquisition two crops were raised and that annual yield was at Rs.720 per acre. But the crucial question is what is the suitable multiplier which would be applicable to the agricultural crops. This question is squarely covered by a Judgment of this Court in Special land Acquisition Officer, Davangere v. P. Veerabharappa & Ors., [1984] 2 SCC p. 120. While disposing of batch of the appeals this Court held that ten years multiplier would be the proper method in determining the total market value by following the method of capitalisation as just and reasonable principle. We find that this principle is quite consistent with the valuation of the land allowed by multiplying the value of the annual yield, in the absence of any other acceptable evidence. Following the ratio we hold that ten years multiplier is the proper method of valuing the lands by capitalisa-tion method. The appeals are accordingly allowed in part and the respon-dents are entitled to the solatium at 15% and interest @ 5% from the date of taking possession till date of deposit. The appellant is entitled to recover the balance amount from the respondents. No cost.","Appeals arise from the Judgment of the High Court of Karnataka dated August 10, 1981 in Misc.

" J U D G M E N T (With CA Nos.11302-03/95) SANTOSH HEGDE, J. Having failed in their endeavour to question successfully the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Entertainments Tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1988 inserting Explanation-II in Section 4 of the Andhra Pradesh Entertainments Tax Act, 1939 before the High Court of Judicature Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad, the appellants are before us in these appeals by way of special leave. The main contention urged on behalf of the appellants by Ms. K. Amareshwari, learned senior counsel, is that the respondent-State could not have collected entertainment tax from the appellants at a rate which is applicable to cinema theatres situated in the area administered by a Municipality because the State Government under the Municipalities Act had not issued any notification equating the respective areas in which appellants’ cinema theatres are situated, with a Municipality. It is the contention of the appellants that in the absence of any such Gazetted Notification the State has no authority to collect the entertainment tax at a higher rate. This argument of the appellants was rejected by the High Court on the ground that this was a question which was available to the appellants to be urged in an earlier writ petition filed by them and that having not been done, the appellants are barred by the principle of constructive res judicata from raising such a contention in the subsequent writ petitions. In this appeal, we need not go to that question because it is pointed out by Mr. G Prabhakar, learned counsel for the State of Andhra Pradesh, that in fact such a Notification as stated by the appellants, was issued by the State Government as could be seen from G.O.Ms.274, M.A. Health and Municipal Administration Department, dated 29th March, 1971 which was in regard to Kothagudem notified area. Learned counsel for the State urges similar notifications are there in regard to other areas involved in these appeals. A perusal of this notification shows that the State Government has, exercising the power under Section 389-A of the Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1965, issued the above notification wherein Kothagudem and other areas found in the different notifications have been equated to that of a first grade municipality in the State, and the said notification has been Gazetted in the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the Andhra Pradesh Government published on 31.3.1971. In view of the above factual position, we are unable to accept the argument addressed on behalf of the appellants. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We also find no merit in the next argument addressed on behalf of the appellants in regard to the retrospective effect of the levy. We find in these appeals there is no challenge to the constitutionality of the levy. The limited challenge is based on the fact that without proper notification under the municipality’s Act, the levy could not be imposed. That argument of want of notification, we have rejected on facts if that be so levy being a valid levy is liable to be collected from the date of its original imposition. In the said view of the matter, we find no merit in these appeals and the same are dismissed. No costs.","Appellants failed in their endeavour to question successfully the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Entertainments Tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1988.

The lone disquieting factor was that  the appellant had a diploma which did not have the approval  of  the  Haryana  Government  and  yet  in  laxity teachers had  been appointed,  in order  to draw work out of them, to meet the State’s educational needs. It  was  for  the  first  time  on  7-7-1981  (copy  of instruction  placed   on  file)   that  the  Directorate  of Education, Haryana  woke up  from its  slumber informing all concerned that  it had  come to the notice of the Department that persons  who  had  obtained  their  teacher’s  training diploma/certificate from  other States  were being recruited or appointed  and it  need be  notified that  the method was irregular. It  was therefore  desired that  in  future  only those persons  shall be  recruited who  have obtained  their teachers’   training    diploma/certificate   from   Haryana Education Department. All concerned were further required to strictly adhere  to these instructions and also to bring all these to  the notice of all the appointing authorities under the jurisdiction of the Government as well as non-government (but recognised) institutions for strict compliance. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It is  on the  basis of the aforesaid letter dated 7-7- 1981 that services of the appellant were terminated on 27-7- 1990. It is  not denied  that  the  appellant  was  taken  in service  on   the  basis   of  the  diploma/certificate  she possessed, having  obtained it  from the Secondary Education Board, U.P.,  Bareilly and  that her  six months’ terms were kept renewed  from time  to time,  ignoring  small  gaps  in between, as  was the  pattern. Therefore we fail to see that when she  was acceptable  in 1980  and her  terms were  kept renewed from  time to  time uptil  22-5-1982,  and  onwards, whereafter she was confirmed in the year 1984, how could her services be  terminated in  the  year  1990,  when  she  had attained regularity  in service.  It is  significant to note that the  letter dated  7-7-1981 was  itself watered down on 22-7-1981 (Annexure  A) clarifying  that the  ban imposed on recruitment   of    persons   who    had   obtained    their diplomas/certificates  from   non-recognised   institutions, would not  apply to  those who  were working  as teachers on stop-gap/adhoc/six months’  basis before the summer vacation of 1981. Concededly, the appellant occupied that position as she was  working on six monthly basis immediately before the summer vacation of 1991. Thus, on account of such relaxation being available  for her and she having earned regularity in her service,  it was  wholly wrong and arbitrary on the part of the  Education Department and the School to have deprived her of  her job.  Thus, the  impugned order  dated 27-3-1990 (Annexure H)  relieving the  appellant from  her  duties  as Hindi Teachress  with immediate  effect, is quashed, putting her back  to position  with back  wages  and  regularity  of service, including other service benefits such as seniority, promotion, increments  etc. as  would have normally been due to her. The appeal thus stands allowed in these terms.",The High Court dismissed the writ  petition of the appellant in limine. The appellant had put  to challenge order dated 27-3- 1990 (Annexure-H) whereby she was relieved from her duties with immediate effect. The lone disquieting factor was that the appellant had a diploma which did not have the approval of the Haryana Government.,divorce,24.88
" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Heard parties at length. We have been taken through the evidence and other materials on record.   We are in agreement with the findings that the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt as against the Appellant.  The High Court has rightly held that the offence which is made out is under Section 304 Part II I.P.C.   We therefore find no infirmity in the Judgment of the High Court. We have also considered the submission that the Appellant should be given the benefit of Section 5 of the United Provinces Borstal Act, 1938.  Considering the fact that the High Court has already taken a very lenient view and sentenced the Apppellant, under Section 304 Part II, only for a period of 5 years, no case for further reduction of the sentence and/or giving benefit of the said Section arises.  We therefore see no reason to interfere. Accordingly the Appeals stand dismissed.  The bail bond shall stand cancelled.  The Appellant should be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence.",The High Court has rightly held that the offence which is made out is under Section 304 Part II I.

" THE 26TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Hon’ble Mr. Justice B.N. Kirpal M.P. Jha, Adv. for the appellant Anil Kumar Jha, Adv. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI, J The appellant  was convicted by the trial court for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.  On an appeal, the High Court  altered his conviction from under Section 302 to Section 304  Part I IPC and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for ten years.  The appellant is challenging in this appeal  his conviction  and the  sentence imposed  upon him. The conviction  of the  appellant is  based solely upon the dying  declaration.   it has  been found to be reliable. It was  made by the deceased within about two hours from the incident and  a few  hours before  his death.   In his dying declaration, he  has clearly  explained how  he came  to  be injured by  the appellant.  After carefully scrutinising the dying  declaration,   both  the  courts  have  come  to  the conclusion that  it contains  a truthful  version as regards the manner in which the injuries were accused to him. Learned counsel  for the  appellant, however, submitted that in view of the inconsistency between the version of the deceased and  the version  of the  eye-witnesses, the courts ought not  to have relied upon the dying declaration without any independent  corroboration.   The eye-witnesses  did not support the  prosecution and were declared hostile.  As they did not  state anything  about the  spear blow  given by the appellant, really  there is  no inconsistency  between their evidence and  the dying  declaration.   it was  submitted by learned counsel  that in the dying declaration, it is stated that the  appellant after  giving a spear blow had taken out the spear  from the  body of  the deceased  and had taken it away with  hi,   PW. 14-another  Chowkidar on the other hand has stated in his evidence that he had produced the spear of the appellant  before the  Investigation Officer.  That does http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 not necessarily  mean that  he had recovered that spear from the place of offence. We therefore, do not find any inconsistency between the dying declaration  and the  other evidence  on record.    No other infirmity  in the  dying declaration  could be pointed out by the learned counsel. We are  of the  view that  the courts  below wee  fully justified  in   relying  upon   the  dying  declaration  and convicting the appellant. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. The appellant  is ordered  to surrender  to custody  to serve out the remaining part of sentence.","The appellant was convicted by the trial court for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.

" O R D E R It is  not necessary  to go into the controversy raised in this appeal since the contesting respondents have already retired  by   attaining  superannuation.  This  Court  while granting leave and admitting the appeal stated thus: ""Status  quo  pending  disposal  of  the appeal as  of today  in  the  matter  of reversion  as   a  consequence   of  the judgment  of   the  High  Court.  Future Promotions will be subject to the result of the appeal."" In the  judgment of  the High  Court in  first part  in paragraph 46. it was stated thus: ""We would  further like  to clarify that any order  that may  be passed  in these writ petitions  should  not  effect  any confirmation  or  substantive  Promotion made Prior  to the  filing of  the  writ petitions."" In the  ultimate paragraph  of the  judgment a contrary opinion was expressed stating that any action taken Prior to November 29, 1979 was illegal. It is  stated by the appellant that on his Promotion as Executive Engineer  on July  12, 1979 though initially on ad hoc basis,  he was confirmed and regularised as an Executive Engneer on  June 30, 1980.

The  rights accrued  to the appellant Prior  to the  date of  the  filing  of  the  writ petition would  continue to  be available  to him, since his Promotion and confirmation as such was not quashed.

As many as eight persons were put up for trial before the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Bhabua in Sessions Trial Case No. 285/5 of 1994. By Judgment and Order dated 22nd November, 1995 the Trial Court acquitted as many as six of the accused persons but convicted Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 of the offences under Section 302 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act. Respondent No. 2 was sentenced to death whereas Respondent No.3 was sentenced to imprisonment for life. ...2/- -2- Two separate appeals were preferred by Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 before the High Court of Judicature at Patna being Criminal Appeal Nos. 379 and 406 of 1995 which were heard along with Death Reference No.3 of 1995. The High Court, on a consideration of the evidence on record, came to the conclusion that the Trial Court was fully justified in acquitting six of the accused persons and the evidence of the eye-witnesses did not appear to be reliable inasmuch as even those eye-witnesses who alleged overt acts against some of the acquitted accused persons were not believed. In fact, two of the accused persons against whom overt acts were alleged, were not even named in the first information report. The High Court thereafter considered the evidence of the sole eye-witness, the informant Ayodhya Singh (PW9), and did not rely on his evidence, particularly when the other eye- witness namely Jatau Ram was not even examined by the prosecution. The High Court has noticed the fact that the deceased and the prosecution witnesses are closely related.

It is well settled that if on the same evidence two views are http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reasonably possible, where the Court below takes a view in favour of the accused, the Appellate Court will not set aside the order of acquittal unless it finds the findings to be perverse, highly unreasonable, based on no evidence on record or made in ignorance of relevant evidence on record or for other such reasons. We find that in the instant case, the High Court appreciated the evidence on record and recorded its findings which appear to be reasonable and based on evidence on record. ...4/- -4- We, therefore, find no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the High Court.

" JUDGMENT 2002 (1) SCR 940 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. Jarnail Singh, respondent No. 2 executed two documents of sale (Exs.

P-2 in favour of the first respondent was executed at 10.00 a.m. and it was not shown when Ex. D-l was executed in favour of the petitioner, the High Court, vide its order dated October 25, 2001, in RSA No. 4050 of 1999 confirmed the concurrent finding of the courts below holding that Ex. P-2 prevails over Ex. D-l and thus dismissed the second appeal. It is against the said order that this Special Leave Petition is filed. In view of the provisions of Section 47 of the Registration Act, 1908 it is well-settled that a document on subsequent registration will take effect from the time when it was executed and not from the time of its registration. Where two documents are executed on the same day, the time of their execution would determine the priority irrespective of the time of their registration. The one which is executed earlier in time will prevail over the other executed subsequently. In view of the concurrent findings, referred to above, the High Court has rightly held that Ex. P-2 prevails over Ex. D-l . We find no illegality in the order of the High Court warranting our interference under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.

" THE 26TH DAY OF FEBRUARY, 1998 Present : Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Hon’ble Mr. Justice V.N. Khare Jayant Tripati, Adv. for the appellants Anees Ahmed  Khan, Ms.  Kamakshi S.  Mehlwal,  A.S.  Pundir, Advs. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI, J. We have heard learned counsel and also gone through the evidence and  the judgment  of the  High Court. We find that the findings  recorded by  the High  Court are  correct. The evidence of four witnesses, namely, Nathu, Dilawar, Jameelan and Nanhey clearly establishes that Mahmood died as a result of the  shots fired  by Ali  Ahmad and  Mahmod Sher and that Jameelan and  Nanhey received  injuries as  a result  of the shots fired  by those  two accused.  The manner in which the appellants had  assaulted Nathu  initially  and  chased  him right up  to the  house of Mahmood, their entering the house of Mahmood  and then  firing shots  at him  and his wife and child, when  Mahmood had  protested, clearly  indicate  that both Ali  Ahmad and  Mahmod Sher had acted in concert and it was in  furtherance of  their common intention that they had caused death  of Mahmood and bodily injuries to Jameelan and Nanhey. The  High Court  was, therefore, right in convicting Ali Ahmad  and Mahmod Sher for the offences punishable under Section 302  read with  34 IPC  and Section 307 read with 34 IPC. The  other three  accused were  rightly convicted under Section 324 read with Section 149 IPC only. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed. The appellant  Nos. 2-5  are on  bail.

" O R D E R The  order  under  appeal  is  of  the  High  Court  at Allahabad in revision petitions filed by the Commissioner of Sales Tax  under the  U.P. Sales  Tax Act.  The question for consideration was  whether brass  wire manufactured  by  the assessee was  classifiable as  ’brassware’ as claimed by the Revenue or under a notification dated 6.10.1971 issued under sub-section (2) of Section 3-A which mentioned ""copper, tin, nickel or  zinc, or  any other alloy containing any of these metals"". The High  Court rightly  proceeded upon  the basis that the brass  wire manufactured by the assessee was an alloy of copper and zinc. It, however, rejected the argument that, as such, it  was covered  under the aforementioned entry in the notification. It  emphasized the words ’any of these metals’ in the entry and observed that if an alloy consisted of more than one  of the metals mentioned in the entry, it would not be covered  by it. An alloy, in its view, with copper or tin or nickel  or zinc  would be  covered by  the entry,  but an alloy comprising  more than  one of  these metals was beyond its scope.  The High  Court also  relied upon the subsequent entry in  the notification  and observed that the use of the word ’all’  in that  entry and  its omission in the relevant entry indicated  that the intention was to confine the lower rate of tax only to those alloys which comprised only one of the metals named. On a  plain reading  of the entry, we find it difficult to agree.  Brass is  an alloy.  It contains copper and zinc. It, therefore,  contains a metal mentioned in the entry. The entry applies to an alloy containing any of these metals. It applies, therefore,  to brass.  It is of no consequence that the alloy  (brass) contains  more than  one  of  the  metals mentioned in the entry. The conclusion that we have reached is fortified by the judgment of  this Court  in M/s  Saru Smelting (P) Ltd., vs. Commissioner of  Sales Tax,  Lucknow, 1993 Supp. (3) SCC 97, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 where the  entry was  very similar,  namely,  ’copper,  tin, nickel or  any other  alloy containing  any of  these metals only"". The Court said:- ""The emphasis in the entry is -- either it should be pure copper, tin, nickel or zinc and if it is an alloy  containing   two   or   more metals,  it   must  be   an   alloy containing these metals only"". Since the alloy in question before the Court there contained phosphorous, which  was not  one of  the metals mentioned in the entry, the alloy was held to fall outside the entry. Brass wire,  therefore, falls  within the  entry in the said notification. The appeals  are allowed.  The judgment under appeal is set aside.  The revision  petitions filed  before  the  High Court are dismissed. There shall be on order as to costs.",The High Court at Allahabad dismissed revision petitions filed by the Commissioner of Sales Tax under the U.P. Sales  Tax Act.

Singh, for the petitioner. S.   C. Manchanda and O. P. Rana, for the respondent The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, C. J.--This petition under Art. 32 has been filed  by the three appellants in Civil Appeals No. 2018-2020 of 1968, in which we have just delivered judgment.  In this  petition the  vires  of s. 6, cl. (xvii), of the U.P.  Imposition  of Ceiling  on Land Holdings Act, 1960 (U.  P. Act 1 of  1961)- hereinafter  referred to as the Act-and rule 4(4) of the  U. P.  Imposition  of Ceilings and Land Holdings  Rules,  1961, have  been  challenged.  It is urged that  these  provisions http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 violate  Art.  14,  19(1)(f)  and  (g)  and  31(1)  of   the Constitution.   The learned counsel for the State  contended that  the impugned provisions are protected by Art.  31B  of the Constitution, as the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 is included in the Ninth Schedule as  item  58.  The learned counsel for the  petitioners,  in reply,  urged (1) that the impugned provisions have  nothing to  do with land reform, and (2) that rules made  under  the Act do not enjoy the protection of Art. 318.  It is admitted that the land 720 in  dispute is a ’holding’ within S. 3(d) of the  Act.   The definition reads : ""Holding"" means the land or lands held by  a person  as a bhumidhar, sirdar, asami of  Gaon Samaj or ant asami mentioned in Section 11  of the  Uttar  Pradesh, Zamindari  Abolition  and Land  Reforms Act, 1950, or as a tenant  under the U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, other than a  sub- tenant,  or  as a Government lessee, or  as  a sublessee  of a Government lessee,  where  the period  of the sub-lease is co-extensive  with the period of the lease."" It seems to us that if a statutory rule is within the powers conferred  by a section of a statute protected by Art.  31B, it  is  difficult  to  say that the  rule  must  further  be scrutinised under-Arts. 14, 19, etc.  Rule 4(4) seems to  us to  be a rule which does not go beyond the powers  conferred under s. 6(xvii), read with S. 44 of the Act.  At any  rate, S. 6(xvii) and rule 4(4) are part of a scheme of land reform in U.P. and would be protected from attack under Art. 31A of the Constitution. In  the  result we hold that s. 6(xvii) and  rule  4(4)  are valid The petition accordingly fails.  In the  circumstances there will be no order as to costs. V. P. S.

" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 108 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. Heard learned counsel on both sides. The respondent was working as Assistant Commissioner (Assessments) in the Sales Tax Department of the Government of U.P. By proceedings dated October 28, 1991, he was compulsorily retired from service on the ground that in spite of awarding adverse remarks for several years, the respondent had not improved and that, therefore, he was found to be an officer of bad category. On having been challenged by the respondent in writ petition No. 93 of 1992, the High Court in its judgment and order dated May 5, 1992 allowed the writ petition evaluating the evidence and finding that the order of compulsory retirement was by way of punishment without any opportunity which amounts to his removal from service violating Article 311 of the Constitution. The representation filed by the respondent against adverse remarks of 1989-90, was pending consideration and without its disposal, it cannot be taken into consideration. When disciplinary proceedings were pending, initiating proceedings for compulsory retirement also amounted to arbitrary and illegal exercise or power. We have issued notice to the respondent who appeared through counsel and filed counter affidavit. It is now settled law that the entire service record should be considered before taking a decision to compulsorily retire a government servant exercising the power under Rule 560(j) of the Fundamental Rules. It is not necessary that adverse remarks should be communicated or every remark, which may sometimes be categorised as adverse, be communicated. It is on an overall assessment of the record; the authority would reach a decision whether the government servant should be compulsorily retired in public interest. In an appropriate case, there may not be tangible material but the reputation of officer built around him could be such that his further continuance would imperil the efficiency of the public service and would breed indiscipline among other public servants. Therefore, the government could legitimately exercise their power to compulsory retire a government servant. The court has to see whether before the exercise of the power, the authority has taken into consideration the overall record even including some of the adverse remarks, though for technical reasons might be expunged on appeal or revision. What is needed to be looked into is the bona fide decision taken in the public interest to augment efficiency in the public service. In the absence of any mala fide exercise of power or arbitrary exercise of power, a possible different conclusion would not be a ground for interference by the Court/Tribunal in exercise of its judicial review. In this case, the judgment was delivered on May 4, 1992 and on the same day hardly even the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ink of Judge’s signature dried up, he was reinstated. He is due to retire on his attaining age of superannuation on May 31, 1995. Hardly nine months remain for him to reach superannuation. In this view of the matter, we find that no useful purpose would be served in allowing the appeal. However, it is needless to emphasise that in cases of serious nature, the government should expeditiously pursue the remedy and seek appropriate directions from the court. Leisurely, the appeal was filed on September 18, 1992 after reinstatement. In these circumstances, the appropriate course would be that during the remainder period of service if the respondent indulges in any corrupt practice, it would be open to be appropriate authority to report immediately to the Chief Secretary and the Chief Secretary would pass appropriate orders removing him from service without any notice or enquiry. The appeal is accordingly disposed of but without costs.","The respondent was working as Assistant Commissioner (Assessments) in the Sales Tax Department of the Government of U.P. He was compulsorily retired from service on the ground that in spite of awarding adverse remarks for several years, the respondent had not improved and that, therefore, he was found to be an officer of bad category.",special leave petitions,30.53

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS.4247-4248 OF 2001 Heard Mr. T.S. Doabia, learned senior counsel for the Union of India, and Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, learned counsel appearing for the Union Territory of Chandigarh.  None appears on behalf of the principal respondents-Dr. Jai Dev Wig and Dr. M.S. Sekhon. The challenge in these appeals is to the orders dated 7.8.1998 in CWP No. 12360-C/1998 and 8.7.1999 in CWP 6169-C/1998 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. Despite receipt of notice, principal respondents-Dr. Jai Dev Wig and Dr. M.S. Sekhon are not represented either by themselves or by a counsel.  It was contended that by this time they might have retired from service. Briefly stated the facts are as follows: The respondent-Dr. Jai Dev Wig was working as Additional Professor, Department of Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. The Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Personnel & A.R., issued an Office Memorandum dated 9.4.1981 on the subject of relaxation of upper age limit for departmental candidates in Government departments giving relaxation of a maximum of 5 years in the upper age limit for recruitment to other Group \021A\022 or Group \021B\022 posts through an advertisement by the Commission.  The respondent-Dr. Jai Dev Wig filed an application before the Central Administrative Tribunal claiming benefit of age relaxation provided to the Government servants in terms of the aforesaid office memorandum.  The Tribunal allowed the application. Aggrieved thereby, the Union Public Service Commission filed a writ petition before the High Court as aforesaid.  By the said order the High Court was of the view that the post held by the principal respondent was akin to the Government servant and, therefore, he is entitled to the relaxation.  The High Court was, however, of the view that the provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution of India do not apply to the employees of the Institute.  Before the High Court, it was the case of the Commission that Dr. Wig was overage as on the cut-off-date and he being not in Government service was not eligible for the benefit of relaxation.  The said contention was repelled by the High Court holding Dr. Jai Dev Wig entitled to the relaxation at par with the Government servants. It is not in dispute that the Post Graduate Institute in which respondents-Dr. Jai Dev Wig and Dr. M.S. Sekhon were http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 serving is a creation by an Act of Parliament and as such it is an autonomous body.  However, the services of the respondents were not covered by the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution.  Article 311, as held by the High Court, was also not attracted in their case.  Therefore, in our considered opinion it cannot be held that the respondents are Government servants.  The benefit of Office Memorandum dated 9th April, 1981 giving relaxation of upper age limit for departmental candidates for appointment to Group \021A\022 and Group \021B\022 posts cannot be legally extended to the service conditions of Dr. Jai Dev Wig and Dr. M.S. Sekhon. Thus, the contrary view taken by the High Court holding both the respondents entitled for benefit of relaxation in terms of the aforesaid Office Memorandum is erroneous and cannot be sustained.  The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms. The orders of the High Court as well as the order of the Tribunal granting benefit to the respondents shall stand set aside.  We may clarify that in the meantime if any benefit of the order of relaxation has been given to Dr. Jai Dev Wig and Dr. M.S. Sekhon by the concerned authority, such benefit shall not be withdrawn from them.   No order as to costs.","Dr. Jai Dev Wig was working as Additional Professor, Department of Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS 1585-1587 OF 2008 [ Arising out of SLP [C] Nos.1072-1074 of 2008 ] 1.      Leave granted. 2.      These appeals are directed against an interim order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Letters Patent Appeal No.177 of 2007 with Civil Application No.303 of 2007 in Civil Application Nos.1916 and 1554 of 2007 in Writ Petition No.3079 of 2006.  By the impugned order, the Division Bench of the High Court had modified an interim order passed by a learned single Judge, which was as follows: - ""[i]    As the Company has decided to reinstate the workmen instead of paying dues u/s 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the workmen shall be paid wages at par with unskilled permanent workmen or the statutory minimum wages whichever is higher, from the date of this order. [ii]    If no work is provided to the workmen by the employer, they shall be paid wages @ Rs.2,500/- per month. [iii]   These wages shall be paid by the employer and accepted by the workmen without prejudice to their rights and contentions in the petition. [iv]    The arrears payable to the workmen on account of non- payment of wages @ Rs.2500/- per month, when work was not provided to them, after the order of this Court dated 29.8.2006, shall be paid within a period of four weeks from today."" 3.      This interim order of the learned single Judge was taken in appeal by the Management before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The Division Bench disposed of that appeal by keeping the interim direction Nos. 2 to 4 intact but so far as the interim direction No. 1 was concerned, it was moulded as follows: - ""As the Company has decided to reinstate the workmen instead of paying dues u/s 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the workmen shall be paid last drawn wages or the statutory minimum wages whichever is higher, from the date of this order."" As noted herein earlier, these special leave petitions have been filed against the aforesaid modified interim order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. 4.      We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and examined the two interim orders passed by the learned single judge and the Division Bench. Mr. R.F. Nariman, the learned senior http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 counsel appearing for the respondent submitted on instruction that the management had never agreed to reinstate the workmen and therefore, the question of calling the workmen to work in the company during the pendency of the writ petition shall not arise at all. The learned senior counsel for the appellant, however, submitted that since the management is not willing to reinstate the workmen, they should be paid in compliance with the interim direction No.4 made by the learned single judge, which has been affirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court, that is to say, when no work was provided to the workmen, the workmen shall be paid wages @ Rs. 2500/- per month till the disposal of the writ petition. Such being the stand taken by the parties before us, we dispose of these appeals with the following directions: - i)      The management shall not call the workmen/appellant for work in the company and therefore, the workmen/appellant shall have no obligation to join the company for work but, during the pendency of the writ petition, the management shall go on paying wages @ Rs. 2500/- per month. ii)     The High Court is requested to dispose of the pending writ petition at an early date preferably within 4 months from the date of supply of a copy of this order. 5.

Advs. with him for the Respondents. J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI, J. Both these  appeals arise  out of  the judgment  of the Punjab &  Haryana High Court in Crl. Appeal No. 579/DB/1986. The High  Court acquitted all the accused who were convicted by the  trial court.  Criminal Appeal  No.659/89 is filed by Pohap Singh  P.W.  13,  father  of  the  deceased  Bir  Pal. Criminal Appeal No.660/89 is filed by the State. It was  the prosecution  case is that while Pohap Singh along with  his son  Bir Pal and complainant Umed Singh were passing through  a public  street had reached near the house of Abhey  Singh, they  were attacked  by Abhey  Singh and  6 others in  view of  the previous  enmity. As a result of the said attack  all the  three of  them and four others who had come to  their rescue  rescue  received  injuries.  Bir  Pal succumbed to  the injuries  soon after incident. All of them were, therefore  tried for  offences punishable  under Secs. 148, 302 read with 149, 325 with 149 and read 149 I.P.C. The trial court relying upon the evidence of Pohap Singh, P.W.13 and Hukam Singh, P.W. 12 convicted Abhey Singh and Ram Kumar for the  offence punishable  under  section  302  read  with sec.34 I.P.C.  Rest of  the  accused  were  convicted  under sections 148, 325 read with 149 and 324 rad with 149. The High  Court on  reappreciation of  the evidence  of Pohap Singh and Hukam Singh came to the conclusion that they had not  given a  correct version  regarding the  manner  in which  the   incident  had   happened  Their   evidence  was desbelieved  by   the  High  because  the  medical  evidence disclosed that  the accused  had  received  as  many  as  26 injuries as against 18 injuries received by deceased Bir Pal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and his companions. The High Court has held that the two eye witnesses had  made material improvements while giving their evidence. It  also held  that the  eye  witnesses  have  not explained when  and under  what circumstances  they  started giving blows  to the accused. Only a vague statement made by them that  after they were injured some persons who had come there on  hearing their  cries had  wielded their sticks and that is  how they  received injuries. That version was found by the High Court as improbable and unnatural and therefore, it  recorded   a  finding   that  the  complainant  and  his companions  were  the  aggressors.  They  had  attacked  the accused and  whatever injuries  were received  by them  were caused by  the accused in exercise of their right of private defence. It  is not  possible to  say that the view taken by the High Court is so unreasonable as to call interference by the High Court is so unreasonable as to call interference by Court. The  findings recorded by the High Court are based on evidence and  the   reasons given  by it  cannot be regarded improper of perverse. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.","The High Court acquitted all the accused who were convicted by the trial court.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(1) SCR 103 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave is granted. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Second Appeal No. 1748 of 2000 dated August 20, 2001. We have been taken through the judgment under challenge. It is evident that the learned Judge has disposed of the second appeal unmindful of the amended provisions of Section 100 C.P.C. inasmuch as no substantial question of law has been framed which is obligatory thereunder. Section 100 C.P.C. reads as under : ""100. Second Appeal-(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. (2)  An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree passed ex parte. (3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal. (4)  Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question. (5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question : Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question."" From a perusal of the above provisions, it is manifest that the High Court can entertain a Second Appeal only if it is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. An obligation is cast on the appellant to state precisely the substantial question of law involved in the case in the memorandum of Second Appeal and if the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in the Second Appeal it is required to formulate that question. The appeal has to be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 heard on that question though the respondent is permitted to argue that no such question is involved in the case. Nonetheless, the High Court has power to hear the appeal on any other substantial question of law not formulated by it provided it is satisfied that the case involves such other substantial question and in that event it has to record reasons. This Court reiterated the requirement of Section 100 C.P.C. on a number of occasions. [See : Shankareppa M. Mutanki v. B. M. Mutanki, [2000] 9 SCC 254 and Birendera Mumar Dubey and Anr. v. Girja Nandan Dubey and Ors., [2001] 6 SCC 767. The learned Judge, in the instant case, failed to frame any substantial question of law though he formulated points which arose for his consideration and accordingly decided the appeal. It follows that interference by the High Court in Second Appeal without framing substantial question of law is impermissible and unsustainable. In this view of the matter, we set aside the judgment and order under challenge, restore the Second Appeal (No. 1748 of 2000) to the file of the High Court and remand the case to the High Court for disposal in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Second Appeal No. 1748 of 2000 dated August 20, 2001.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated 15.1.1996  of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal, made in M.P.  No. 3473/95. The respondent was initially appointed as  non-formal  Facilitator  under  a  non-formal  Education Programme, a  scheme sponsored by the Central Government for imparting primary education to the children in the age group of 16  to 12  years. The  State Government issued on October 10, 1990  guidelines  for  appointment  of  Facilitators  as regular primary school teachers. In the said guidelines, the Facilitators have  to complete  three years  of service  and must have  acquired C.T.  training by  31.13.1990. When  the respondent filed  an O.A.  in the Tribunal, the Tribunal had given direction  to  the  appellant  to  consider  his  case according to rules. It is not in dispute that by proceedings dated May  19, 1993,  his case was considered and he was not fund eligible under the rules. The respondent field contempt proceedings in the Tribunal stating that the appellants have deliberately violated  the orders passed by the Tribunal. In the impugned order, it is stated that; ""In the  circumstances,  the  order dated  11.11.1992   be  implemented within 15  days from  the  date  of receipt of  a copy  of this  order. The applicant  be given appointment like  his  juniors  who  have  been given such  appointment. If none of his   juniors   have   been   given appointment, then  the  Respondents would  take   action  as   per  the prevailing instructions  by  giving him   notional    appointment    as Sikhyakarmi in  accordance with the Circular dated  24.9.1992 and after determining  as  Sikhyakarmi,  give appointment  to   him  as   regular primary school teacher, as is being done in cases is Sikhyakarmis."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Calling that  order is  question, this  appeal has been filed. From the  order, it is clear that the Tribunal has gone wrong in  giving direction contrary to the directions issued in the  main order.  Since direction  was issued to consider his case  according to  rules, necessarily,  the  appellants were required  to consider  the claim  of the  respondent in accordance  with   the  guidelines.   Obviously,  since  the respondent had not fulfilled the qualification prescribed in the guidelines,  he could not be appointed. Accordingly, his case was rejected. The impugned direction is contrary to the direction issued  on the  earlier occasion  and  the  rules. Therefore, in a review petition, the Tribunal could not have gone behind the main order and issued fresh directions. When we asked  the learned  counsel for  the appellant  to  state whether any  of the  juniors of  the  respondent  have  been appointed, it  is stated  that none of the juniors have been appointed. Learned  counsel appearing for the respondent has stated that  some of  the persons  who did  not  fulfil  the qualifications are  being appointed  and, therefore,  it  is contrary to the direction issued by the Tribunal. We find no force in the contention. Admittedly, they are not juniors to the respondent  and we  do not know under what circumstances their appointment  case to  be made. But the learned counsel for the  appellants has stated that after the superannuating of  number   of  teachers  some  vacancies  have  arisen;  a seniority list  of teachers  has been  prepared; the name of the respondent  is also  included in the seniority list; his case would be considered as and when the vacancies arise and he would be appointed accordingly.

" O R D E R Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short, ‘the Act’) acquiring an extent of six acres 21  Gunthas of  land for  Hydro Electric  Project  was published on  August 12,  1975. The Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation  at various  rates for  wet  land,  dry land, garden  land and  phot-kharab land. On reference under Section 18,  the Civil  Court enhanced the compensation at a uniform rate  of  Rs.15,520/-  per  acre.  On  appeal  under Section 54,  the High  Court enhanced  the  compensation  to Rs.18,000/- per  acre.  Dissatisfied  therewith,  the  State Government has filed this appeal by special leave. Sri Veerappa,  the learned  counsel for  the State, has contended that  the High  Court committed grave error of law in  recording   a  finding  that  lands  were  possessed  of potential value  for building  purposes. We find no force in the contention.  It is  seen that  when 7,800 tenaments were constructed in  the project  area, it  would be clear that a township had  come into  existence. It  is an  admitted fact that the  land under acquisition is abut the township. It is also an admitted fact that in Ext.A-12 sanction was obtained on September  13, 1973  for conversion of agricultural lands into urban lands of the layout and sale of plots which could not take  place due  to the fact that mud was dumped on this land. Consequently, the sanction came to be cancelled by the Assistant Commissioner. Be that as it may, the High Court on the basis of the rental value had determined compensation at the rate of Rs.1200/- per acre applying the multiplier of 15 and arrived  at the net income at Rs.18,00/- per acre. It is now settled law that the uniform rate of multiplier of 10 is being applied  for the  lands acquired  even in the State of Karnataka. Even  acceding the  multiplier of  12 as  held by this Court  in Special  Land Acquisition  Officer, Davangree vs. P.  Veerabhadarappa and  Ors. [1984  (2) SCC  120],  the claimant cannot  get more  than Rs.14,000/-  per acre. Since http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the State  had not  filed the  appeal against  the  enhanced compensation under Section 26 of the Act, the amount awarded by the  Reference Court  had become  final. Therefore,  this Court cannot interfere with and reduce the compensation less than the  amount awarded  by the  Civil Court.  The enhanced compensation stands  upheld at  the rate  of Rs.15,520/- per acre with  solatium at  the rate  of 15% and 15% interest on the enhanced compensation. The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed  but   in   the circumstances without costs.","Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation at various rates for wet land, dry land, garden land and phot-kharab land.

Three contentions have been raised by the learned counsel  for the  petitioner; firstly, that when the Court had  directed to  consider the  case of the petitioner vis-a-vis others,  the Public Service Commission should have evaluated the  respective  merit  and    found  whether  the petitioner is  more meritorious  over those persons but that was done.  We find  no force  in the  contention. A counter- affidavit has  been filed   by the Public Service Commission in the  High Court  in which  it was  pointed   out that the relevant    merit  of  the  12th  respondent  vis-a-vis  the petitioner was  considered and  she was  found  to  be  more meritorious. The  second  contention  was  that  the  Public Service Commission  having found him eligible, called on the Government to  find whether  there is  an additional  vacant post which  would show that petitioner was more meritorious. There was  an additional  post vacant but the Government had given false  statement that  the post  was not available. We find no  force in  the contention.  Admittedly, having  been sought for  nomination   to   the posts  available in  1991, merit has  to be  considered only  among the  candidates for appointment  to   nine  posts   arose  in  1991.  Therefore, Government have  rightly  did  not  consider  the  case  for selection for  subsequent vacancies  which would  effect the candidates who  became qualified later. It is then contended that 50% of the marks were allotted to the interview and 50% marks were  allotted for  the record.  Allotment of  50% for interview is  arbitrary in view of the law laid down by this Court. We  find no  force in  the contention.  It is not the case  that   any  written   examination  was  conducted  for consideration of the claims of the parties. Accordingly, the Public Service  Commission and  the Government have  applied the principle  of keeping  50% marks  for the record and 50% http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for the interview. Under those circumstances, we do not find any illegality in the order passed by the High Court. The SLP is accordingly dismissed.","Special leave petition filed against the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court made on January 29, 1996 in W.P. No. 4882/95.

" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 259 The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. This appeal filed by the State of Goa and others, is directed against the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court, (Goa Bench). The respondents made an application for a lease for mining mineral boxite in Mopa, Chandal, Warkhan, Kasarwame Villagers of Pernem Taluk in Goa. As this application was not disposed of by the State Government within 12 months as stipulated in Rule 11 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 the application was deemed to have been rejected. Against this order of deemed rejection the respondents filed a revision under Section 30 of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’) to the Central Government in which a direction was issued to the State Government to dispose of the respondents’ application on merits. In pursuance of the direction issued by the Central Govern-ment the State Government decided the application of the respondent and rejected it on 18th August 1987. This order was set aside by the High Court and the State Government was directed to decide the application, afresh, after hearing the respondents and deciding the applicability of the amend-ment to the Act which had come into force with effect from 10th February 1987. The application was heard this time by the Commissioner and Secretary for industries to the Government of Goa who being a delegate of State Government by virtue of notification issued under Section 26 of the Act was empowered to decide the application. The application was rejected in exercise of power under sub-section (3) of Section 10 the Act. Against this order the respondents approached the State Government. The order was set aside by the Minister for Mines and direction was issued to grant the lease. What happened thereafter is not necessary to be narrated. But the order of the Minister was set aside by the Government. Validity of this order was challenged in the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Various issues were raised. They were decided in favour of the respondents. The order of the Government dated 14.1.1993 was quashed and that of the Minister dated 31.10.1991 was restored. It is the correctness of this order that has been challenged by the State. The appeal has been argued at length. Shri Siraj Sait has attempted to support the judgment with industry and precision. But it does not appear necessary to decide whether the finding recorded by the High Court that the order of Commissioner being administrative in nature it could be reviewed by the State Government nor it is necessary to decide whether the Minister could exercise any power where the grant of lease is regulated by the Statute as in our opinion the remedy of revision having been provided by Section 30 of the Act, the proper course for the respondent was to approach the Central Government and not the High Court. Learned counsel for the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 respondent expressed apprehension that the period for limitation provided in rule 54 of the Minerals Concession Rules, 1960 having expired, the revision might not be entertained. The proviso to the rule, however, empowers the revising authority to condone delay if it is satisfied that the revision could not be presented for sufficient cause within time. Since the respondent was pursuing its remedy in High Court bona fide, it would be sufficient cause to condone the delay and we trust that the revision if preferred within four weeks from today shall not be dismissed as being barred by time. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is allowed. The order of the High Court is set aside subject to the observations made above that the respondent shall be entitled to approach the revising authority, namely, the Central Government within four weeks from today which shall decide the same in accordance with law. Parties shall bear their own costs.","The appeal filed by the State of Goa and others, is directed against the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court, (Goa Bench) The respondents made an application for a lease for mining mineral boxite in Mopa, Chandal, Warkhan, Kasarwame Villagers of Pernem Taluk in Goa.

" J U D G M E N T MARKANDEY KATJU, J. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Madras High Court dated 14.2.2002 in O.S.A. No. 275 of 1999. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The case of the appellant is that the testator Singaravelu Nayagar executed a will on 24.9.1986 registered as Document no.66 of 1986 on the file of the Sub Registrar, Purasavakkam.  The testator had two daughters viz. Kausalya, the respondent herein (who is the elder daughter) and one Saraswathi.  The appellant is the eldest son of the said Saraswathi.  Apart from the appellant the said Saraswathi has two more sons viz. Gopi and Manohar.  The testator appointed the appellant as executor under the suit will and as such he alleged that is entitled to get the probate. The respondent filed a written statement contending that the will dated 24.9.1986 alleged to have been executed by Singaravelu Nayagar is a forged one and that the testator had executed a will dated 4.11.1982, much earlier to the execution of the will dated 24.9.1986 where under he bequeathed the property at No.16, Manicka Naicken Street, Purasavakkam, Madras, giving equal share to both the daughters. The question involved in this case is a short one i.e. whether the will dated 24.9.1986 executed by Singaravelu Nayagar was a valid one. A learned Single Judge of the High Court by his judgment dated 25.5.1996  held that the will dated 24.9.1986 was genuine and was not a forged one.  The learned Single Judge took into consideration various factors e.g. that the testator himself presented the will for execution, and there was a dispute between the testator and his elder daughter and hence he wanted to bequeath his properties to his second daughter and the sons born to her, etc.. In appeal the Division Bench of the Madras High Court set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge but without a proper consideration of the various facts and circumstances of the case mentioned by the learned Single Judge in his very elaborate judgment. The Division Bench was evidently influenced by the fact that the elder daughter was deprived of her share in her father’s property. However, the Division Bench has not taken into consideration the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 various considerations which according to learned Single Judge motivated the testator to deprive his elder daughter, the respondent herein. No doubt the Division Bench could have reversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge but it should have done so after considering inter alia the various factors which persuaded the learned Single Judge to decide in favour of the appellant herein.  Since the Division Bench has not done so we are of the opinion that the judgment of the Division Bench cannot be sustained and it is hereby set aside.  The matter is remanded to the Division Bench for a fresh decision after considering inter alia the various facts and circumstances of the case referred to by the learned Single Judge and also the evidence and the various case law on the point. The Division Bench may consider the desirability of an early disposal of the case since it is pending for a long time.  The appeal is allowed.

" Y.K.SABHARWAL J. The appellant has been convicted for the offence under Section 302/34 I.P.C.  by Court of Sessions and sentenced to undergo  life imprisonment.  The conviction and sentence has been  confirmed by the High Court in appeal.  The conviction is  based mainly on the testimony of two eye witnesses  PW-2 and  PW-3.   The incident took place at about 9.00 P.M.   on 21st  March, 1992.  The appellant is said to have given  5/6 dagger  blows  to deceased Triveni when Triveni  was  caught hold  by  Jaleshwar  and Jogender.  These  two  persons  are absconding and, therefore, they could not be prosecuted.  On learning  that his son was being assaulted, PW 2, Dipu  Gope the  informant  went  to  place of  occurrence  and  on  way deceased Triveni joined him.  When they reached the place of occurrence,  Triveni  asked about the son of PW-2  whereupon Triveni was taken to nearby pipul tree and the aforesaid two persons caught hold of Triveni and the applicant gave dagger blows  as earlier stated.  Triveni succumbed to the injuries and  died  on the spot.  The other eye witness PW-3  is  the person  with whom son of PW-2 was taking liquor when he  was assaulted  on  outraging modesty of the wife  of  Jaleshwar. PW-3  has  also  stated to have witnessed  the  incident  of stabbing by the appellant. The  appellant  has  not  been   able  to  shake   the credibility of the eye-witnesses.  No material contradiction in  the case of the prosecution has been shown to us.  Under these  facts  and circumstances, the non-examination of  the Investigating Officer as a witness is of no consequence.  It has  not  been shown what prejudice has been caused  to  the appellant by such non-examination. From  the  evidence  on record it stands  proved  that there  was  sufficient light at the place of  occurrence  to identify  the  appellant.  We are also unable to accept  the contention  of  learned counsel for the appellant  that  the conviction  deserves to be converted to be one under Section 304 I.P.C either Part-I or Part-II thereof because there was no  pre-meditation.   The pre-meditation can develop on  the spot   as  well.   It  all   depends  upon  the  facts   and circumstances  of  the  case.   In  the  present  case,  the deceased  was  given  5/6  dagger blows.   In  view  of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 evidence  on  record  the   contention  for  converting  the sentence as aforesaid cannot be accepted.

" O R D E R Appeals are taken on board. These appeals by special arise from the judgment of the Bombay High  Court, Panaji  Bench made  on March 31, 1995 in C.W.P. No.398/94  and batch. The facts relate to the dispute raised by  the respondents  for two  bills, one for a sum of Rs.99,196/- and  the other  for Rs.71,280/-.  The appellant- Union  of   India  has   taken  the  stand  that  under  the Administrative Instructions issued by it, the dispute cannot be referred  unless the  subscriber approaches the Court and the  Court   gives  the  direction  for  appointment  of  an arbitrator under  Section 7B  of the  Indian Telegraphs Act. Section 7B reads as under : ""7-B Arbitration  of Disputes :-(1) Except   as   otherwise   expressly provided  in   this  Act,   if  any dispute  concerning  any  telegraph and  telegraph  authority  and  the person for  whose benefit the line, appliance or  apparatus, is, or has been, provided,  the dispute  shall be determined  by  arbitration  and shall, for  the  purposes  of  such determination, be  referred  to  an arbitrator appointed by the Central Government either specially for the determination of  that  dispute  or generally for  the determination of disputes under this section. (2) The  award  of  the  arbitrator appointed  under   sub-section  (1) shall  be  conclusive  between  the parties to  the dispute  and  shall not be questioned in any court."" A reading  thereof would  indicate that  if any dispute http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 concerning any telegraph line, appliance or apparatus arises between the  telegraph authority  and the  person for  whose benefit the  line, appliance  or apparatus  is, or  has been provided, the  dispute shall be determined by an arbitrator. Such  determination  shall  be  referred  to  an  arbitrator appointed by  the Central Government either specifically for the determination  of  the  dispute  or  generally  for  the determination of  dispute under  this section.  The award of the arbitrator  shall be  conclusive between  the parties to the  dispute   and  its  correctness  is  prohibited  to  be questioned in  a court of law. It would, otherwise, be clear that any  dispute regarding the billing of the refer and the liability on  a subscriber  thereon when  its correctness is disputed, should  be  referred  to  the  arbitrator  by  the Central Government.  The arbitrator’s  award shall be final. In a recent judgment, considering the provisions of the Act, this Court has explained that when the arbitrator’s award is final, it  would be  subject to  only judicial  review.  The judicial review  by the  High Court  or this  Court would be possible only  when the  arbitrator gives reasons in support of the conclusions he reaches. Be it technical or on factual basis. The  Administrative Instructions  issued by the Union of India  that the dispute shall be referred only when there is a  reference by the Court is obviously in defiance of the language used  in Section 7B. The power to refer the dispute has been  given by  the Parliament  only with  a view to see that the  authority acts  within reasonable  limits and that when  subscriber  disputes  the  correctness  of  the  meter reading or  operation  of  the  apparatus  etc.  instead  of litigating the dispute in a civil Court, it should be denied by arbitrator  under Section  7B. Obviously, the Act intends to limit  operation expeditiously without any undue delay so that the  electrical operation,  envisaged  under  the  Act, recorded to  be one  of the  public revenue,  should not  be postponed due  to the  pendency of  the  proceedings.  Under those circumstances,  we are of the view that the High Court is right  in directing  that the  authority under the Act is enjoined to  make reference  under Section  7B  without  any direction by  the Court  and  if  need  be  it  is  for  the subscriber to approach the Court. The  appeals   are  accordingly  dismissed  with  above directions. No costs.","These appeals by special arise from the judgment of the Bombay High Court, Panaji Bench made  on March 31, 1995 in C.W.P. No.398/94.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned single  Judge of  the Punjab  & Haryana High Court, Chandigarh, made on July 11, 1985 in SA No.2830/80. The admitted  facts are  that  the  respondents  Rattan Singh  &  Daulat  Singh  were  brothers.  Daulat  Singh  had executed a will on January 11, 1974 under Ex. PA bequeathing his property  to Rattan  Singh who died on January 19, 1974. It would appear that the appellant is a predecessor-in title of his  sister, Dayal  Kaur. Rattan Singh & Daulat Singh had three sisters  by name  Rallo, Dayal  Kaur and  Inder  Kaur. Dayal Kuar got mutated the properties to the extant of 1/3rd share to  each of  the sister  in the  mutation proceedings. subsequently, the  respondents filed  a suit for declaration on the  basis of  the will.  The trial  Court dismissed  the suit. On appeal, it was confirmed. As stated earlier, in the second appeal, the High court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit as prayed for, Thus this appeal by special leave. Leraned counsel  for the  appellant has  contended that the High  Court could  not interfere  under Section 100, CPC since the  suspicious features  of the will are questions of facts.  The   trial  Court   and  the  appellate  Court  had considered the  suspicious feature  and were not inclined to interfere. It  is the  duty of the propounder of the Will to establish that  Will was  validly executed  removing all the suspicious features  satisfying conscience  of the Court. In that behalf, the high Court was not justified in interfering in the second appeal as there was on substantial question of law for  decision under  Section 100 CPC. It is seen that it is an admitted position that Rattan Singh, on coming to know that his  brother was  unwell, had gone from Calcutta to see him. After  his coming, the Will came to be executed and the execution of  the Will  also  was  not  disputed.  The  only question is:  whether the  Will came  to be  executed in the normal cirumstances?  The courts below relied heavily on two suspicious features,  namely, the  Will was  not produced at the earliest  point of them, it was produced sometime before the trial.  secondly, the  at testators  were disbelieved on two  grounds,  namely,  that  Hari  Singh,  one  of  the  at testators had  not disclosed  that the Will was not executed http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 when the  mutation was  effected in  his presence.  The High Court has  explained that  the  mutation  was  not  properly removed and  that there  was no  reason to  disbelieve  that fact. The High Court had perused the original as well as the photocopy of  the will  produced in  the trial  Court in the first instance.  The High  Court has  found that there is no interpolation in the original Will. Therefore, the rejection of the  evidence of the attestaor, Hari Singh’s evidence was found to  be not  correct. As  regards the other attestator- witness, by  name Gurdev  Singh, It  was disbelieved  on the ground that  he filed  a suit  in a  litigation against Jeet Singh. It  was hardly a ground to disbelieve the evidence of the attestator’s  evidence. Under  these circumstances, when the courts below had rejected and disbelieve the evidence on the ground  that the  propounder had not properly discharged his duty,  it is  the duty  of the  High Court  to  consider whether  the   reasons  given   by  the  courts  below  were sustainable in  law. In  view of  the above reasoning of the trial Court  as affirmed by the appellate Court, necessarily the High Court requires to go into that question to test the reasons. in  this perspective,  the High  Court has  rightly gone into  that question and found that the reasons given by the courts  below are  flimsy.  Thus  there  is  substantial question of  law that  has arisen  for consideration and the High Court  has rightly  considered  the  question.  We  are entirely agree with the High Court. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.","Daulat Singh executed a will on January 11, 1974 under Ex. PA bequeathing his property to Rattan Singh who died on January 19, 1974.

In view of the order proposed to be passed by us, it is not necessary to enter into the merit of the matter. Suffice, it to say that a large number of employees of the appellant - Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.  filed Original Applications before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed the said Original Applications. Shiv Singh and others  filed writ petition before the High Court which was marked as Writ Petition No. 10135/2000(A).

We may, however, notice that an application for review has already been filed. We may furthermore place on record that the respondents have filed an application for contempt of Court for disobedience of the High Court’s order and by reason of a order dated 12.12.2005 a Bench of this Court had stayed the contempt proceedings before the High Court. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the interim relief sought for by the respondents in the writ petition may also be considered afresh by the High Court. In the meantime, the contempt proceedings may not be pursued. We, furthermore, direct till an appropriate order on the said interim relief is passed by the High Court, Status-quo may be maintained.

" R.C. Lahoti, J. L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J Respondent,  K.  Subramanian was havildar in the rank of non- commissioned officers.  During 1985, a court of inquiry was  held for enquiring into certain irregularities relating to  distribution of ration and accounting during the  period 1981-1984.   The name of the respondent also figured in  the inquiry.   Mainly  it was the lack of supervision  that  was attributed to the respondent.  However, those who were found guilty  were proceeded against by holding court martial.  No such  action  was initiated against the  respondent.   Other persons  were  punished in accordance with the  finding  and sentence  pronounced  by the court martial and confirmed  by the  competent authority.  On 26th July, 1988 the respondent was served with a notice under Section 20(1) of the Army Act read  with  Rule 17 of the Army Rules requiring him to  show cause  why  his  services  should not  be  terminated.   The respondent  gave a reply.  On 4.4.1989 he was ordered to  be dismissed from service. Putting  in issue the order of dismissal, the respondent filed  a  writ petition before the High Court  of  Karnataka which  was  heard by a learned single Judge who  vide  order dated  5.12.1989  directed  the  order of  dismissal  to  be quashed   mainly  on  the   ground  of  non-compliance  with principles of natural justice.  In between on 13th November, 1987  the  respondent  had been directed to be  promoted  as subedar  which order was, however, not given effect to.  The Union  of India preferred a writ appeal against the order of learned single Judge.  The writ appeal was partly allowed on 5.12.1989  permitting a further enquiry being held.  In  its judgment  dated 5.12.1989 the Division Bench observed  inter alia   that  though  the   disciplinary  authority  was  not precluded  from  holding a further enquiry but it seemed  to the  court that regard being had to the facts of this  case indicating  that the petitioner had not much to do with  the disappearance  of  the  stock of food  from  the  government stores  in  relation  to  which an  investigation  had  been conducted  by  the Court of Inquiry the authority  may  well consider  whether  it is just and proper at all  to  proceed http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 with a further inquiry. However, a further inquiry was held.  The members of the previous  Court  of Inquiry were not available and  hence  a fresh  Court of Inquiry was constituted.  The respondent was once again issued a notice to show cause against termination and  vide order dated 29.10.1991 he was once again  directed to  be dismissed from service.  The respondent filed a  writ petition  which  was allowed by learned single Judge of  the high  court who has directed the impugned order of dismissal from  service  to  be quashed.

Thiru Thiruvengadam noticing Thiru Palani came near Thiru  Palani  and  by uttering ""when we  cut  your  brother Ravichandran you went and gave complaint to the police.  Now I  am  cutting you.  Let me see who will give complaint  for this.   You die with this cut"", terrorised him and rushed to cut him over his head.  Thiru.  Palani warded off the attack with  his right hand.  However the knife fell over his right fore-arm  and  caused bleeding injury to him.  Thiru  Palani raised  hue  and  cry.  A huge crowd gathered at  the  spot. Thiru  Thiruvengadam  and  others by brandishing  the  knife terrorised  everyone  at the spot by uttering ""if  any  body comes near we will remove the leg, hand"", and also picked up soda  water bottles from the nearby shop of Thiru Srinivasan and hurled the same against the public.  The bottles fell on the  road  side  broken into pieces and  the  broken  pieces scattered  all  over  the  roadside.  The  public  who  were proceeding  in their vehicles noticed and turned back  their vehicles  in  the same direction from which they came.   The nearby  shop-owners noticed and closed down their shops  and suspended  their  business.  The normalcy in that  area  was totally dislocated.  Thus they have created terror and panic http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 at the spot. In our view, there is no vagueness in the said Detention Order.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(4) SCR 635 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. While considering an application for grant of bail to accused in a criminal case, the High Court made certain observations in the order under appeal against the appellants that they have tried to over reach the process of law by submitting a report under Section 169 Cr.P.C. before the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate to discharge all the three accused for serious offences arising under Section 114, 302 IPC and under Section 25 (1)(c) of the Arms Act. The High Court observed that by filing the cancellation report the appellants had shown scant regard to the proceedings before the Sessions Court and the High Court, as on two occasions the petitions for anticipatory bail were rejected; that, the appellants have not applied their mind in filing such a report under Section 169 Cr.P.C. and have tried to interfere with the administration of justice amounting to serious misconduct: that, the State Government should take serious action, including suspension from service of both the appellants. If at the stage of grant or refusal of anticipatory bail certain aspects of the case are considered but later if the investigating agency files a report under Section 169 Cr.P.C., it is difficult to perceive that such a step would amount to interference with the administration of justice. We have carefully gone through the observations made by the learned Judge of the High Court and we are of the opinion that those observations are neither justified nor called for in the case. Therefore, we direct that the observations made in the order of the High Court from paragraph 16 till the end of the order, except the operative part thereof, shall stand expunged.

It is  not necessary  to  dilate  upon  all  the  facts concerning  the   case.  Suffice   it  to   state  that  the respondents have  challenged the  acquisition of part of the land in Survey No. 249 admeasuring 130 acres 19 Guntas which the respondent  claims to  have purchased.  It would  appear that in  the affidavit filed by the Railway, they have given up the  proposal for the acquisition of the land for Railway purpose.

Wen writ petition was filedby the petitioner, the High Court in the impugned  order dated  December 16, 1996 made  inWrit Petition 12133/93 stated as under: ""We do  not feel  inclinedto quash the orderpassed by  the appellate disciplinary  authority   who   has disciplinary  authority   who   has disposed  of   the appeal of  the petitioner by  setting  aside  the order with-holdingone of the three increments and   has  warned   the petition r that in  future no such act/irregularity will  berepeated byhim  and if  itis  done in that event disciplinary actionwill  be taken against him."" It is   contended by  the  learned  counsel  for the petitioner  that   theHigh  Court  has  misunderstood the operative Dartof theorder of the appellate authority. We find no force in  the contention.  TheWord  ""one increment release"" would mean that the appellate authority is inclined to confirm  thepenalty of  imposing  two  incrementswith cummulative effect  andthereby,  one incrementwas released from the penalty. The High Court, therefore, isnot right in construing that two increments have been  released and one was retained.  Instead,the  reverse isthe intention. Under the circumstances, while clarifying thefactualposition, we do not find that it is a case warranting interference. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The only  legal question sought tobe raised in the SLP is  whether   under  Rule   30(3)  of the  Staff  Service Regulation, the enquiry officer  has to  be higher  inrank than the  delinquent officer. Regulation 30 (3)of the Staff ServiceRegulation postulates thus: ""The enquiry  under this regulation and   the  procedure   with   the exception of  the final  order, may bedelegated  in  case  the  person against whom  proceedings are taken isan  officer, toany officer  who isin  a  grade  higher  than  such officer  and  in  the  case  of  an employee,to   any  officer.   For purpose ofthe enquiry, the officer oremployee  may not engage a legal practitioner."" Thus an enquiry, under Regulation may be delegatedto a person higher  in rankthan the  delinquent officer, in the case of an officer.  But in  this case we donot find any substantial  miscarriage  of  justice  preejudicial  to the petitioner for the reason that though it is always desirable that an officer higher in rank than the delinquent officer should be  directed toconductan  enquiry, the  enquiry is conducted as  a delegate  of  the  disciplinary  authority. Therefore, theultimate decision  is to  be  taken  by the disciplinary  authority.  By  mere  delegatingthe  enquiry whetherthe  enquiry officer  is of  the same  cadre  or  of higher grade  than that of thepetitioner, it did not cause any material  irregularity notresulted in anyinjustice to the petitioner. Under these  circumstances, we do notfind any illegality warranting interference. The special leave petitionis accordingly dismissed.","The petitioner was charge-sheeted for dereliction of the duty under Section 3 of theRegional Rural Banks Act (21 of 1976) Afterinquiry, the disciplinary authority directed with-holding of three increments with cumulative effect.

" JUDGMENT Dr. AR. Lakshmanan, J. The above Special Leave Petition was filed against the judgment and order dt.01.10.2003 passed by the High Court of Delhi Civil Writ petition No. 7454/2001 wherein the High Court dismissed the petition preferred by the Union of India and Others through the Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; the Director General, All India Radio, New Delhi and the Chief Engineer (North Zone), Akashwani and Doordarshan, Jamnagar House, New Delhi. The Delhi High Court has relied upon the order passed by the Calcutta High Court in WPCT No.505/99 dt.08.07.2002 which was challenged by another SLP No......CC 11231/2003. The said SLP was filed by the Chief Engineer (East zone) against P. Bhakta and Ors. The said SLP was dismissed by this Court on 08.01.2004 on the ground of delay. Subsequently, a Review petition was filed by the Chief Engineer (East Zone), All India Radio and Television and the said Review petition was also dismissed by this Court on 12.08.2004. Thereafter, the Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India), Directorate General All India Radio (Planning and Development Unit) by their Order dt.29.9.2004/8.10.04 passed an order pursuant to the Central Administrative Tribunal’s order dt.06.08.1999 passed in O.A.No.114/91 in the matter of Sh.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The  notification   under  Section   4  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894 [for  short, ""the Act""] was furnished on January  22, 1981.  Notices were given under Section 9 of the Act.  The Collector  after conducting an enquiry made an award on April 19, 1984 and allegedly took possession of the land on  the even date. The respondents assert that they are in possession.  The respondents  filed the  writ petition on May 13,  1985 challenging  the notification  under Section 4 [1] of the Act on the ground that dispensing with an enquiry under Section  5-A exercising  power under Section 17 [4] of the Act was bad in law as there was no urgency and the award was, on  the face  of the case, valid in law. The High Court by order  dated May  27,  1985  allowed  the  writ  petition following Dharam Singh vs. State of Haryana [C.W.P. No. 2891 of 1984  decided on 9th November, 1984]. Thus this appeal by special leave. It is  contended by  the appellant that after the award had been  made, the  respondents received  compensation  and also sought reference under Section 18. The Land Acquisition Officer was  competent to  make the  award within  two years under Section  11-A of the Act after the Amendment Act 68 of 1984. The  award came  to be made within that period. So the proceedings under  Section 4 and 6 shall not stand lapsed by operation of Section 11-A of the Act. It is  contended for the respondents that enquiry under Setion 5-A  is a valuable right and a minimum right by which the owner is entitled to show that the land is not fit to be used for  public purpose. It would be open to show that some other land  would be more suitable for public purpose, viz., land  for  market  committee.  Exercising  the  power  under Section 17  [4] dispensing  with the enquiry conducted under Section 5-A  is clearly  illegal. Though  there was delay on the part of the respondents in challenging the notification, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 delay does  not mitigate  to take away the valuable right of approaching the  High Court.  The order of the High Court in Dharam Singh’s  case [supra]  was not challenged. It is open to the appellants to canvass the correctness of the award on that premise, though the award had become final. The question  for consideration  is  whether  the  High Court was  justified in  interfering with  the  award  dated April 19,1984  made by  the Collector  and the  notification under Section  4 [1]. It is seen that the notification under Section 4  [1] and  the declaration were not challenged till May 13,  1985 while  the award  came to be made on April 13, 1984. The  respondents in  fact received  the  amount  under protest but  that fact  was not brought to the notice of the High Court.  It is also not in dispute that at that point of time an  application for reference under Section 18 was made within the limitation provided therein. It would appear that after the  writ petition  was  allowed  the  appliation  was withdrawn. After  the award was made, the Court would not be justified to  quash the  notifcation under Section 4 [1] and declaration under  Section 6 for dispending with the enquiry under Setion 5-A. In these  circumstances, we  think that the appropriate course would  be to sustain the notification under Section 4 [1] and  the declaration  under Section 6 and the award made under Section  11. It  would be  open to  the respondents to make an application under Section 18 within 30 days from to- day to  the Collector  for  reference  to  Civil  Court  for determining the compensation. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed and the judgment of the High  Court under  appeal is  set aside. However, in the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.","Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [for short, ""the Act""] was furnished on January 22, 1981.

" J U DG M E N T (Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.1779/2005) MARKANDEY KATJU, J. Leave granted. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Rajasthan High Court dated 25.8.2004 in Income Tax Appeal No.80 of 2004. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The facts of the case are in a short compass.  The appellant assessee deals in precious and semi precious stones.  In the course of assessment the Assessing Officer noticed the following defects in the books of accounts of the assessee : ""1. The assessee has not maintained and kept any quantitative details/stock register for the goods traded in by the assessee. 2.      There is no evidence on record or document to verify the basis of the valuation of the closing stock shown by the assessee.  The assessee is not able to prepare such details even with the help of books of accounts maintained, purchase bills & Sale Invoices. 3.      Provisions of Section 145(3) are clearly attracted in this case. 4.      The genuineness of purchases to the extent of Rs.42 lakhs (approx.) is not proved without any doubt. 5.      The GP rate declared by the assessee at 13.49% during the assessment year is not a match to the result declared by the itself in the previous assessment years. 6.      M/s. Gem Plaza, engaged in local sales of similar goods declared voluntarily rate of 35% in its assessment for the assessment year 1997098. 7.      M/s. Dhadda Exports, another assessee dealing in same items, but doing export business http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 declared GP rate of 43.8% (even without considering the value of export incentives) in assessment year 1997-98."" Thereafter the books of accounts of the assessee were rejected by the Assessing Officer and he resorted to best judgment assessment under Section 144 of the Income Tax Act.  The Assessing Officer in the assessment order mentioned some comparable cases and was of the view that the case of the assessee is more or less having similar facts as that of M/s. Gem Plaza where the Gross Profit has been taken as 35.48%.  The Assessing Officer estimated the Gross Profit of the assessee as 40%. The Assessing Officer further held that the assessee has shown bogus purchases in order to reduce the Gross Profits. In appeal, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) upheld most of the findings of the Assessing Officer, but reduced the Gross Profit from 40% to 35%. In further appeal, the Tribunal had given further relief to the assessee and reduced the Gross Profit rate to 30%. The counsel for the assessee has submitted before us that the Income Tax Authorities wrongly held that appellant has shown bogus purchases, and the books of accounts were wrongly rejected. In our opinion, whether there were bogus purchases or not, is a finding of fact, and we cannot interfere with the same in this appeal.  As regards the rejection of the books of accounts, cogent reasons have been given by the Income Tax Authorities for doing so, and we see no reason to take a different view. It is well settled that in a best judgment assessment there is always a certain degree of guess work.  No doubt the authorities concerned should try to make an honest and fair estimate of the income even in a best judgment assessment, and should not act totally arbitrarily, but there is necessarily some amount of guess work involved in a best judgment assessment, and it is the assessee himself who is to blame as he did not submit proper accounts.  In our opinion there was no arbitrariness in the present case on the part of the Income Tax Authorities.  Thus, there is no force in this appeal, and it is dismissed accordingly.   No costs.","The Rajasthan High Court upheld most of the findings of the Assessing Officer. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) reduced the Gross Profit from 40% to 35%.

" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice. This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office. This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot in 1989 in the Indirapuram Housing Scheme.  The Respondent paid all dues.  Yet possession was not delivered within the time promised.  As the Respondent was in urgent need of accommodation he asked for refund of his amount with interest thereon.  The Appellants refunded the amount but deducted a sum of Rs.5,800/-.  The Respondent thus filed a complaint stating that this amount should also be refunded with interest thereon. The District Forum held that as the Appellants themselves not delivered possession within the time promised, the Respondent was entitled to the refund of all amounts deposited and the Appellants could not have deducted the sum of Rs.5,800/-.  It therefore directed return of that amount with interest at the rate of 18% thereon. The State Forum dismissed the Appeal. The National Forum has also dismissed the Revision. We are in agreement with the observations of the District Forum. If the Appellants had not delivered possession within the time http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 promised the allottee would be entitled to claim for refund.   Where the refund is claimed due to the faults of the Appellants themselves they cannot deduct any amount and must refund all the amounts received from the allottee.  We therefore see no infirmity in the impugned Order or in the Orders of the District and State Forums.  We are told interest at the rate of 10% has been paid.  The Appellants shall now pay to the Respondent the balance amount of interest.  The interest to be calculated from the date of deposit of each installment till the date of payment.  If any TDS has been deducted the same shall also to be refunded with interest at the rate of 18% thereon.  Along with the payment, the Appellants shall also handover the calculation sheet showing therein how they have calculated the interest amount. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter having been passed on account of the special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment dated March  29, 1996 passed by the division Bench of Orissa High Court  in O.J.C.  No. 1389/96. The admitted position is that the  respondents are  displaced persons and they sought for and  were granted  assignment of  the land  in  reserved forest by the State Government on various dates between 1982 and 1985  for cultivation.  One of  the conditions  for  the grant was  that the  trees standing  on the land allotted to them ""Shell  be the  property of the State Government"" It is clear from  Section 2  of the  Forest Conservation  Act 1980 that it  contemplates restrictions  on the  dereservation of forests or  use of  forest land  for non-forest  purpose and postulates thus: ""Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in  force  in  a  State,  no  State Government or other authority shall make,   except   with   the   prior approval of  the Central Government any order directing- (i)  that any reserved (with in the meaning of the expression ""Reserved forest"" in  any law  for  the  time being in  force in  that State)  or any portion  thereof shall cease to be reserved; (ii) That  any forest  land or  any portion thereof may be used for any not-forest purpose; (iii) that  any forest  land or any portion thereof  may be assigned by way of  lease or  otherwise to  any private person or to any authority, corporation, agency  or  any  other organisation not  owned, managed or controlled by Government; http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (iv) that  any forest  land or  any portion thereof  may be  cleared of trees which have grown naturally in that  land   or  portion,  for  the purpose    of    using    it    for reafforestation."" Having overlooked  these crucial  statutory provisions, the High  Court has  directed, by the impugned order, at the behest of  the respondents,  by way  of  writ  of  mandamus, issuance of  Timber Transit  permits to the respondents. the question is:  whether the  impugned direction  issued by the High court s correct in law? Except with prior permission of the Central  Government, deforestation  is impermissible. It is seen  that it  cannot be  disputed that land are situated within reserved  forest area.  In the  lands assigned to the petitioner, the  trees are  standing. In  terms of the grant made to  them, the  trees belong  to the  Government.  Under those circumstances,  for the  reason that  it  is  reserved forest area since the grant was made only for the purpose of cultivation  the   respondents  have   no  manner  of  right whatsoever to  deforest the  land and  to cut  and carry the trees belonging  to the  Government much  less with  out the permission of the any authority.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  dated April 18, 1995 of the Delhi High Court made in RFA No.217/72. The admitted position is that an agreement of sale  dated April  7, 1969  was executed  to  convey  the property on  the plot  of land  admeasuring 100 square yards situated in  Dayanand Colony,  Lajpat Nagar,  New Delhi  for Rs.16,000/- and  Rs.2,500/- was  paid as  earnest money. The respondent filed  the suit on July 13, 1970 for the specific performance if the agreement and also claimed, alternatively damages for  a sum  of Rs.  12,00/-  with  interest  payable thereon. The  courts  below  have  granted  the  decree  for specific performance. Thus this appeal by special leave. The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  has  fairly contended that  specific  performance  of  the  contract  is within the  discretion of  the Court  and is not a matter of course. The   courts  in granting  the decree  for  specific performance  should   exercise  the   discretion  on   sound principles of law. In the event of working out the equities, the courts  would in  an appropriate case, grant alternative relief,  stead   of  granting   the  decree   for   specific performance. In support thereof, he sought to place reliance on the  judgment of  this Court  in S.Rangaraju  Nidu v.  S. Thiruvarakkarasu [AIR  1995 SC  1769]. He contended that the appellant  is   prepared  to   pay  a  sum  Rs.10  lakhs  as alternative   relief;    though   the   respondent   claimed Rs.12,000/- instead of granting specific performance at this distance of  time which  word  be  unjust,  inequitable  and unfair. It is  contended by learned counsel for the respondents that the  respondent had  secured balance  honey and  he was always ready did willing to perform his part of the contract which inding  was affirmed  by both  the courts  below;  the appellant  had   avoided  execution   of  the  sale    deed; http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 therefore, the courts below have rightly granted the decree; and there  is no  justification for  interference  with  the decree granted by the courts below. Having regards  to the  facts  of  this  case  and  the arguments addressed  by the  learned counsel,  the  question that arises  for consideration is: whether it would be just, fair  and   equitable  to  grant  the  decree  for  specific performance? It  is true  that the  rise in  prices  of  the property during the pendency of the suit may not be the sole consideration for  refusing to  decree the suit for specific performance. But  it is  equally settled  law that  granting decree for  specific performance  of a contract of immovable property is  not automatic.  It is  one of  discretion to be exercised on  sound principles.  When the  court  gets  into equity jurisdiction,  it would be guided by justice, equity, good conscience and fairness to both the parties. Considered from  this  perspective,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the respondent  himself   had  claimed  alternative  relief  for damages, we  think that  the courts  would  have  been  well justified  in   granting  alternative  decree  for  damages, instead of  ordering specific  performance  which  would  be unrealistic and  unfair. Under  these circumstances, we hold that the  decree for specific performance is inequitable and unjust to the appellant. The appeal  is accordingly allowed. The appellant shall not again  sell the property for five years. The respondents will be  paid a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs within a period of three months from to-day. In case the respondents avoid receipt of the amount  within the  stipulated time, it would be open to the appellant  to deposit  the same  to the  credit  of  the plaintiff in the trial Court. In case of default, the decree would stand confirmed. No costs.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment and order dated April 18, 1995 of the Delhi High Court made in RFA No.217/72.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Punjab & Haryana High Court, made on 10.8.1984 in CWP No. 1154/84. The admitted facts are the respondent, while working as a  Small  Pox  Supervisor  in  the  Health  Department,  had tendered his  resignation on  April 23,  1982 to contest the election as  a Member of the State Legislative Assembly. His resignation was  accepted on  May 18, 1982. He contested the election  but   was  defeated.   Thereafter,  he   filed  an application on  May 21,  1982 withdrawing  his  resignation. That was  dismissed. Consequently,  the respondent filed the aforesaid writ  petition in  the High  Court. The High Court observed that  since three  similarly situated  persons  had been given the same relief. Article 14 would apply only when invidious  discrimination   is  meted   out  to  equals  and similarly  circumstanced   without  any  rational  basis  or relationship in  that behalf.  The respondent  has no right, whatsoever and  cannot be  given the relief wrongly given to them, i.e.,  benefit of  withdrawal of resignation. The High Court was wholly wrong in reaching the conclusion that there was invidious  discrimination. If we cannot allow a wrong to perpetrate, an  employee, after  committing misappropriation of money,  is dismissed  from service  and subsequently that order is  withdrawn and  he is  reinstated into the service. Can a  similar circumstanced  person  claim  equality  under Section 14 for reinstatement? Answer is obviously ‘No’. In a converse case,  in the  first instance, one may be wrong but the wrong  order  cannot  be  the  foundation  for  claiming equality for  enforcement  of  the  same  order.  As  stated earlier  for  enforcement  of  the  same  order.  As  stated earlier, his right must be founded upon enforceable right to entitle lion  to  the  equality  treatment  for  enforcement thereof. A  wrong decision by the Government does not give a right decision  by the  Government does  not give a right to enforce the  wrong order  and claim  parity or equality. two wrongs can  never made  a right.  Under these circumstances, the High  Court was clearly wrong in directing reinstatement of the  respondent by  a mandamus  by a  mandamus  with  all consequential benefits. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.  6682   OF 2002 Even on second call, in Court none appeared for the respondent. We have heard Mr. Ashok Bhan, learned senior counsel for the appellant. In a view of the question of law we propose to dispose of this appeal with a short order. On 26.8.1998 the respondent Sh. R.L.Yadav who was appointed on the post of Head of the Department  (Electronic)  was transferred to  Guru Nanak Dev Polytechnic  with immediate effect to look after the work of Principal.  The order clearly stated that he will not be entitled to any additional remuneration for this and also have no claim for regular appointment to the post.  The order reads thus: ""Shri R.L.Yadav Head of Department (Electronic) presently posted at Ambedkar Polytechnic is transferred to Guru Nanak Dev Polytechnic with immediate effect. Shri R.L.Yadav will also look after the work of Principal.  He will, however, not be entitled to any additional remuneration for this and will also have no claim for regular appointment to the post. -2- It appears that the respondent was not paid in the pay scale of Principal. Aggrieved thereby he filed Original  Suit before the Tribunal. The Tribunal directed to pay the respondent in the scale of Principal.  The High Court has confirmed the order of the Tribunal by the impugned order.  Hence, this appeal by special leave. At the outset we may point out that before the High Court the decision of this Court rendered in  Ramakant Shripad Sinai Advalpalkar vs. Union of India and others (AIR 1991 SC 1145) has been referred to.  However, the High Court has followed a decision of this Court in Selvaraj vs. Lt. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Governor of Island, Port Blair and Others reported in (1998) 4 SCC 291 rendered by a two Judge Bench.  The earlier decision is rendered by a three Judge Bench.  We are of the view that the High Court erroneously followed the  decision in Selvaraj (supra). In that case the order of appointment itself stated that the appellant was to look after the higher post temporarily and in an officiating capacity.  In that case the appellant was a primary school Teacher.  By an order passed by the Director of Education he was asked to look after the work of Secretary (Scouts). In the order it was clearly stated that the appellant would be entitled to the salary of the post of Secretary (Scouts).  It is also not disputed that the appellant was drawing the scale of Rs.1200-2040 whereas the scale of pay of Secretary (Scouts) was Rs.1640-2900. In these circumstances since it was made clear in the appointment order that the appellant will be entitled to the scale of Secretary (Scouts), a direction was issued that the appellant be paid in the scale of Secretary during the time that he looks after the work of Secretary. This decision is therefore clearly distinguishable. -3- In the present case, as already noticed above, the appointment  order clearly states in the order appointing the respondent on the officiating post (incharge post)  that he shall not be entitled to any additional remuneration and he will also have no claim for regular appointment to the post.  This is the distinguishing  fact with  the judgments in Ramakant Shripad case (supra) and Selvaraj case  (supra) followed by the High Court. In view of the aforesaid facts, we are clearly of the view that the High Court was clearly in error in following the judgment rendered in Selvaraj (supra). This appeal is accordingly allowed.  The orders of the High Court and the Tribunal are set aside.  No costs.",On 26.8.1998 the respondent Sh.

" CIVIL ORIGINAL  JURISDICTION: Writ Petition No. 1220 of 1979. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution) P. Govindan Nair and N. Sudhakaran for the Petitioner. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 M. M. Khader and V. J. Francis for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,   J.-The  petitioner,  an  aspirant  for admission to  the M.B.B.S.  course in  one or  other of  the medical  college  in  Kerala,  has  failed  to  qualify  for selection  from  the  Kerala  university  pool,  not  having secured high enough marks, and has failed to fall within the Calicut University  pool, not  having been a student of that University. What is  urged, as  a claim  for inclusion, is that had she been  treated as  a Calicut University student her marks would have  been sufficient  to gain admission and since she belongs to the Malabar region, which 830 is broadly  served by  the Calicut University, she should be given  the   benefit  of  Calicut  University  students  and consequential   admission-a    mixture   of    district-wise backwardness and  university-wise preference  to  reach  the desired advantage. We  cannot   agree.  Under  the  existing  scheme,  the classification for  purpose of quota is university-wise, not territory-wise. Belonging  to backward  Calicut District  is not the  same as being an alumnus of the Calicut University. Maybe,  the   State   could   have   classified   candidates university-wise,   backward    region-wise   or   otherwise, separately   or    in   any   constitutionally   permissible combination. We are not here concerned with the prospects of the petitioner  under  any  different  admission  scheme  or reservation  project.  Mystic  maybes  are  beyond  judicial conjecture. Once we hold that the university-wise allocation of seats is valid the misfortune of the petitioner is damnum sine injuria, if we may use that expression in this context. Every adversity  is not  an injury.  Judicial remedy  cannot heal every  wound or cure every sore since the discipline of the law keeps courts within its bounds. We do  not preclude  the State  from taking  any  other pragmatic  formula   or  evolving  any  selection  calculus, constitutionally permissible,  so  as  to  promote  equality against the  backdrop of  social justice. Indeed, we have by our Judgment  in Dr. Jagadish Saran & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.(1),  explained the  parameters, the  criteria and the correct measures  which must  be initiated to marry equality to excellence, solemnised constitutionally. Too long  has the  state been  seeking ad hoc solutions and improvising  remedies where  comprehensive  studies  and enduring recipes  are the desideratum. To keep the education situation uncertain  across  the  nation  and  the  fate  of students of  higher education  tense  or  in  suspense  with annual challenge  in court  or agitational  exercises in the streets is  dangerous procrastination  fraught with negative results where  a creative  undertaking of  responsibility to find an  enduring answer to a chronic problem is the minimum that  the   country   expects   of   the   concerned   State instrumentality. We dismiss this petition subject to the observations we have made  above, leaving  it to  the Kerala  State and  its Universities not  to contribute to the litigative nursery of medical candidates  but to  face the  task of shaping a firm policy governed  by  constitutional  guidelines,  not  other pressures.

" ORDER The  only point for consideration which has been  argued  by the learned counsel for the appellant, is that the  combined reading  of  Sections 48 and 49 of the  Karnataka  Town  and Country  Planning  Act, 1961 envisages a public  enquiry  in which  the citizens of a Municipality are entitled to  raise their  voice  for and against it when varying  a  scheme  on account  of  an  error, irregularity  or  informality  under Section 48 or when revoking or varying such scheme in  terms of  Section 49.  The High Court of Karnataka has  taken  the view  that no such hearing as such claimed by the  appellant is envisaged under sub-section (2) of Section 49 because the action impugned herein has been taken under that  provision. The argument is built by the appellant’s learned counsel  on the relativity of both the sections.  Having considered  the objection from all possible angles and having heard  learned counsel   in   detail,  we  are  of  the   view   that   the interpretation  given by him does not commend to us  on  the plain  language of the provisions employed.  It is  left  to the  discretion  of  the State Government  when  revoking  a scheme  under  sub-section (2) of Section 49  to  make  such inquiry  as  it  deems  fit,  and  such  inquiry  need   not necessarily  extend to the citizens getting any  opportunity of  being  heard.

" JUDGMENT Delivered By: S.C.AGRAWAL S.C. Agarwal, J. This petition  has been  filed  by  the  petitioner  in person. It  has been described as Election Petition-cum-Writ Petition. During  the course  of his  submissions before the Court it  was pointed  out to  the petitioner  that  such  a composite  petition   is  not   maintainable  and  that  the petitioner could  choose to  have the petition treated as an election petition or a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The  petitioner submitted that the petition be treated as  a writ  petition and  that the reliefs sought by him regarding  setting aside  of the  election of respondent No. 1  may be  deleted. As  per the  said statement  of  the petitioner this petition has been treated as a writ petition filed under  Article 32  of  the  Constitution  and  reliefs (a),(d) and  (h) has  been deleted.  The  petition  is  thus confined to  the Challenge to the validity to the provisions of  Sections  5B  and  5C  of  the  Presidential  and  Vice- Presidential Elections Act, 1952 [hereinafter referred to as ’the Act]  as amended  by Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections [Amendment]  Ordinance, 1997  [No.  13  of  1997], hereinafter referred  to as  ’the Ordinance.’ Insofar as the challenge to  the validity of Sections 5B and 5C, as amended by Act 5 of 1974 and as they stood prior to the promulgation of Ordinance  of 1997, has been upheld by a 7-judge bench of this Court  in Charan  Lal Sahu  vs. Neelam  Sanjeeva Reddy, 1978 (1)  SCR 1.  The validity  of Ordinance  was challenged before this Court in     W.P.(C)   Nos.293/97   and   322/97 which have  been dismissed by orders dated June 19, 1997 and July 11,1997  respectively. The  Ordinance has been replaced by  the   Presidential   and   Vice-Presidential   Elections [Amendment] Act,  997 [Act  35 of 1997]. The validity of the said Act  was challenged  in W.P.

" O R D E R This  six   accused-respondents  were   tried  for  and convicted or  offences punishable  under Sections  147, 148, 307 and  302 IPC  (3 counts),  I appeal,  the High Court set aside  their   convictions  and  acquitted  them.  Aggrieved thereby the  appellant, who happens to be the wife of one of the three  deceased and  figured as  an eye  witness to  the incident, filed this appeal after obtaining special leave. On perusal  of the  impugned judgment  we find that the principal reason  which  weighed  with  the  High  Court  in setting aside  the convictions of the accused-respondents is that the  statement (Ext.  01) made  by the  accused persons during the incident) before a Magistrate which was initially recorded as  her  dying  declaration  but  was  subsequently treated as a statement recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. in view of  her survival  and the  report (Ext.  P1)  that  she lodged with  the police  (which was  treated  as  the  first information Report)  contradicted each  other maternally. In our considered  view, this  approach of  the High  Court  in dealing with  the evidence  was patently  wrong. It is trite that a  case has  to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced by  the witnesses  during the trial and any previous statements made  by any of such witnesses can be used by the defence  for   the  purpose   of  only   contradicting   and discrediting that particular witness in the manner laid down in Section  145 of  the Evidence Act. Under no circumstances can such  previous  statements  be  treated  as  substantive evidence as  has been treat by the High Court in the instant case. In  view of  these well settled principles of law, the High Court was first required to consider the statement made by the  prosecution witnesses  during trial  and decide  for itself whether  those statements  should be  relied upon  in view of  their contradictions  (if any)  with their  earlier statements, provided  those contradictions  had been brought on record  under Section  145 of the Evidence Act. The other patent infirmity  in the  impugned judgment is that the High Court discarded  the evidence  of  the  witnesses  who  gave ocular version  of the  incident with a sweeping observation that they  were artificial and unnatural and that it was not possible to  place  any  reliance  upon  their  testimonies, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 without referring, much less discussing the same. For the  foregoing discussion we set aside the impugned judgment and  remand  the  matter  to  the  High  Court  for disposal of  the appeal  in accordance  with law.  Since the matter is  long pending,  the High  Court  is  requested  to dispose  of   the  appeal   as  expeditiously  as  possible, preferably within  a period  of two  months from the date or communication of  this order.

" O R D E R Admittedly, the  petitioner is  in possession  of  land admeasuring about  848.67 sq.mtrs.  being plot  No. 53-A  of scheme No.52,  Worli Estate  in Greater  Bombay as a tenant. The landlady,  Mrs. Jerbanoo  Khurshad Jehangir Cursetji and her husband  Dr. K.J.  Khurshad filed a writ petition in the High Court  for a direction whether petitioner would acquire the land  or surrender possession to them so that they would develop the  land on  their own accord. In the Writ Petition No.1733/94, the  High Court  had  directed  by  order  dated August 16,  1994 to  take a  decision whether the petitioner would proceed with the acquisition. In that event, direction was   given to  the Collector  to take  necessary action for acquiring the  land within  four months from the date of the said order.  Accordingly, notification  came to be published under the  Land Acquisition  Act, 1894  on February 23, 1995 and  award  enquiry  was  conducted.  The  Land  Acquisition Officer in  his award  dated May  30,  1995  determined  the compensation at the rate of Rs.8300/-per sq.ft. for the land in  question  and  determined  the  total  compensation  for Rs.7,57,92,954/- along  with other  compensation  for  other lands with  which we are not concerned. Since the amount was not paid,  the respondents  have taken  motion in  the above writ petition  being motion in the above writ petition being motion  No.156/96.  The  Division  Bench  has  directed  the petitioners to deposit the amount by June 30, 1996, which we are informed, was extended to October 1, 1996. Shri N.N.  Goswami,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the petitioner, sought  to contend  that  the  Land  Acquisition Officer  has   determined  compensation   arbitrarily   and, therefore, it is not a reasonable rate of compensation which the lands  are capable to fetch. Alternatively, he contended that  since   the  petitioners   have  been   continuing  in occupation as  tenants, they  are also  entitled to pro rata compensation for  the tenancy rights held by the petitioners and that  the Land  Acquisition Officer,  therefore, has not properly considered  the same.  As far as the first point is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 concerned, we  find absolutely  no merit.  The award  of the Collector is  an offer  made on  behalf of  the  State  and, therefore,  under   law,  the   State  cannot  question  the correctness of  the award determined by the Land Acquisition Officer. The  State  is  bound  by  the  same.  Under  these circumstances,  they   cannot  impeach   the  award  of  the Collector as  being excessive of the prevailing market value as on  the  date  of  the  notification.  There  is  no  law applicable to the petitioners that they are entitled to seek any reference  under Section  18  as  regards  the  rate  of compensation determined under Section 23(1) of the Act. Only in the  State to  seek reference  under Section  18 (3)  was conferred upon  the Commissioner.  No such  similar  law  is existing under Act 1 of 1894. He states  that the  Government have filed another writ petition which  was dismissed  on August  30, 1996  in which they claimed  the  right  to  compensation  awarded  by  the Collector towards  their tenancy  rights. If  that be so, it would be  open to  them to agitate the remedy in that behalf in an  appeal filed  against that order in the writ petition or in  any appropriate proceedings arising thereunder.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises form the order of the Division  Bench of  the Andhra  Pradesh High Court dated July 7,  1995 made  in Writ  Appeal No.96/94.  The  admitted facts are, that the respondent had a mining lease granted by the Director  of Mines on September 18 1979 to extract mines in the  forest area  for five  years i.e.  upto September 12 1984. The  Forest (Conservation)  Act, 1980 case in to force on October  25 1980.  Therefore by the date of the expiry of the lease the authorities were denuded of the power to grant renewal of  the mining  lease. Lease  is  right  to  extract minerals and  the renewals should  be in accordance with the law in operation as on the date of renewal. Renewal of lease being not  a vested  right the application for renewal; must be disposed  of according to law prevailing as on that date. On expiry  of the  lease period,  on September  13 1989,  an application came to be made for renewal thereof. It would be obvious that  the renewal  was in  violation of Section 2 of the forest  Conservation Acts  since  admittedly  the  prior approval of the Central Government was not obtained. Consequently  the   Forest  Department   in  the  joint inspection made  on  February  7.1990  discovered  that  the respondent was  extracting mines  within the forest area and therefore,  they  issued  directions  canceling  the  lease. Consequently the   respondent  case to file writ in the High Court. After  the  joint  survey  was  conducted  under  the direction of  the High  Court, the  High Court  directed the respondent to  carry on  extraction of  the stacked material form the  forest area, subject to the respondent’s obtaining prior approval  of the  competent  authorities.  Thus,  this appeal by special leave. It is  contended by Shri Subba Rao, learned counsel for the respondent,  that what the respondent had been denied is not making  any fresh  extraction of the mines in the forest area but  only the removing of the stacked minerals form the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 surface of  the earth, that too, with the permission granted by the  authorities: the  direction issued by the High Court in the impugned order, therefore, is correct in law. We find no  force   in  the  contention.  The  learned  judges  have proceeded on  the premise that the respondent is entitled to extract and  remove minerals,  said to  be  stacked  on  the ground that  the lease  is a  valid lease: otherwise he does not get  any right.  The premise on which the Division Bench has proceeded  is obviously  illegal. Section  2 of  the Act prohibits of  mining operations  if the  mines are  situated within the  forest area.  It is a total prohibition,  unless the State  Government grants  mining lease  with  the  prior concurrence of the Central Government. Admittedly, the prior concurrence of the Central Government had not been obtained. Shri Subba  Rao sought  to place  before us  the  guidelines issued  by   the  Department   of  Environment  and  Forest, Government of  India in relaxation of Rules/Guidelines under Forest (conservation)  Act 1980.  Therein the question is of the clearances  of  the  project  by  the  State  Government without obtaining  the prior   concurrence of the Department of Environment  and forest.  In that behalf it was mentioned that the  renewal of  the mining  leases. if they are within particular radius  was directed to be done without any fresh breaking up  of fresh  area and  felling of  the  trees  but subject to  re-forestation. It this case that situation does not arise.  This is  a case  of grant  of renewal in routine way. Under  these circumstances, the direction issued by the Division Bench of the High Court is clearly illegal.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. This appeal is filed against the order dated September 23, 1991 made by the Karnataka High  Court in  C.R.P. No.3019/87.  The facts  are clearly not in dispute. They are stated as under: The appellant  was a tenant prior to 1959. In 1959, the appellant had  entered into an agreement with the respondent to purchase  the premises  for some consideration. Since the appellant claimed  that the  respondent was  not willing  to perform his  part of  the contract,  he laid  the  suit  for specific performance.  In the  suit, the  parties ultimately had compromised  the  dispute  and  agreed  to  enhance  the consideration to  a sum  of Rs.38,000/-/- payable within the specific time. Unfortunately, the appellant had not paid the amount within the agreed time which put an end to the rights asserted by the appellant under the contract. When an  application for  eviction under  Section 21 of the Karnataka  Rent Control  Act was  filed,  the  appellant raised preliminary objection that his tenancy rights had got merged in  his right  as an  agreement-holder and  he was in possession of  the suit-premises  as an agreement-holder and not as  a tenant  and thereby  he disputed  the title of the respondent. The appellant sought for a decision by the Civil Court in  that behalf.  The Controller  negatived it and the High Court  by the  impugned order  affirmed the  same. Thus this appeal by special leave. It is contended by Mrs. Kiran Suri, learned counsel for the appellant  that the  tenancy rights  which the appellant had prior  to 1959  stood  merged  with  the  rights  as  an agreement-holder. The appellant was always ready and willing to perform  his part of the contract and was entitled to the benefit of  Section 53-A  of the  Transfer of  Property Act, 1882. The tenancy rights thereby stood merged with the right as an  agreement-holder and that, therefore, the application http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for eviction did not lie. The Rent Control Court under those circumstances had  no jurisdiction to go into that question. We find no force in that contention. So long  as the  agreement subsists,  it is settled law that the  lesser right  of tenancy  stood merged with larger rights accrued under the agreement. But unfortunately in the compromise itself  it was  recognised that the appellant was to pay arrears of rent till the date of compromise. In other words, the  appellants recognised  the reversion to his pre- existing rights  as tenant  upto the date of the compromise. In other  words, subject  to compliance  of the terms of the contract, his  tenancy rights  continued. The terms have not been complied with and the agreement came to amend. Thereby, the  appellant’s  pre-existing  rights  as  a  tenant  stood revived and  the appellant  and the respondent were bound by the relationship of landlord and tenant. Therefore, the Rent Controller was  entitled  to  proceed  with  the  matter  in accordance with  law. We  do not  say any  further since the matter is  pending before  the Rent  Controller. It would be open to  the appellant to raise all the defences open to him in the Rent Control proceedings. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The appeal is filed against the order dated September 23, 1991 made by the Karnataka High Court in C.R.P. No.3019/87. The facts  are clearly not in dispute.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.23428 of 2005) G. P. MATHUR, J. 1.      Leave granted. 2.      This appeal, by special leave, has been filed challenging the judgment and order dated July 18, 2005 of  High Court of Punjab and Haryana, by which the writ petition filed by the respondent Saroj Bala was allowed and it was directed that her services shall be regularized w.e.f. October 1, 2003 with all consequential benefits. 3.              Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the issue of regularization of service has been recently examined by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. Uma Devi & Ors. (2006) 4 SCC 1 and the judgment rendered by the High Court is not in accordance with law laid down in the aforesaid case.  Learned counsel has further submitted that the award of the Labour Court dated June 2, 2003 passed in favour of the respondent was challenged by the appellants by filing C.W.P. No.13335 of 2005 and the High Court has stayed operation of the award by the order dated August 25, 2005. 4.      Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the Government of Haryana has issued a policy dated October 1, 2003 for regularization of employees, whereunder the respondent is entitled to be regularized.  Learned counsel for the appellants has not disputed the said fact, but has submitted that regularization of service can be done only in accordance with the conditions which are enumerated in the said policy but the respondent does not satisfy the conditions enumerated in the said policy. 5.      Having considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the matter requires a fresh consideration by the High Court in the light of the decision referred to above and also the policy issued by the Government of Haryana. 6.      The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment and order under challenge is set aside.   The matter is remitted back to the High Court for a fresh decision of the writ petition.   It is made clear that this Court is not expressing any opinion on the merits of the claim made by the respondent.","The appeal, by special leave, has been filed challenging the judgment and order dated July 18, 2005 of High Court of Punjab and Haryana.

" J U D G M E N T IN CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 4579-4580/2003 SANTOSH HEGDE,J. While considering the above review petitions in Chambers and while giving liberty of  oral hearing  to the parties we issued notice  on  27.8.2003 to the respondents on these review petitions. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.  Review petitions are admitted. After hearing the learned counsel we think it  appropriate to dispose of  these review petitions finally.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submits while remanding the above  appeals back to the High Court, we had indicated that we will not be expressing any final opinion on  any of the issues involved  in the said appeals.  But while perusing the copy of the judgment parties noticed that in regard to the question of the authority of a single Member of the Company Law Board to decide issues such as one that was involved in the case before the Company Law Board, we had expressed our agreement with the finding of  the learned  single Judge of the High Court which according  to the learned counsel was not intended  since we had decided to remand the matter back to the High Court for consideration of issues not considered by the High Court in the impugned order. The learned senior counsel for the respondents however contended that this question was argued before this Court and the finding given by us  on the said question was not unintended but was a finding given after hearing the parties concerned.  Therefore, there is no need to review the said order. As could be seen from our order under review, the issue that arose  for consideration  before the High Court was not only the question of jurisdiction of a single member of the Company Law Board  to take up the matters sitting singly, but also other issues involving various other questions.  But the High Court decided only the question of jurisdiction of  the single Member of the Company Law Board to entertain a petition without going into the other issues. Therefore, while requiring the High Court to  give a finding  on all other issues also which arose before it in the appeal, we think it was not  correct  on our  part to have expressed our views in regard to the sole issue decided by the learned single Judge.  While this Court  on remand  need not go into the  issue already decided by it, namely, the jurisdiction of the single  member  to entertain a petition, we expect the  High Court to decide the other issues so that the aggrieved party could take recourse to such remedy as is available to them   in law.  In that process, we think the expression of a view by us as to the correctness of the finding of the learned single Judge was unnecessary. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Though this expression of our view may not be an error apparent on the  face of  the record, in the interest  of justice, we think that this issue though it stands concluded so far as  the High Court is concerned,  same should  be kept open to be agitated in  a future proceeding after the High Court decides the other issues involved in the appeal as directed in the above order of ours. Therefore, we in the process of reviewing the order delete the observation as to our agreement with the finding of the learned single Judge on the question  of the authority of a single member of the Company Law Board to decide issues such as one that was involved in the cases before him, and as held  in the original  order  of  ours, the matter  will  stand  remitted to the High Court for deciding the other issues except the one already decided by the  High Court.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 6240 of 1987.  The appellant had challenged the order dated 12.12.1986 (Annexure 4 to the writ petition) passed by the appellate authority under the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act, 1976 (in short the ’Act’) in U.L.C.(Misc.) Appeal No. 241 of 1985 on the ground that the issues are concluded by an earlier order passed in appeal against the draft statement under Section 6 by the competent authority. Though the said point was taken in the objection and mentioned in the writ petition but it was not pointed out that the appellate authority did not consider the same.  In the absence of any such statement the High Court held that it cannot be presumed that the point was urged and the appellate authority had overlooked the same.  Therefore, the High Court refused to interfere in the matter. 2.      Though many points were urged in support of the appeal, the primary point urged was that possession has not been taken pursuant to orders passed by the authorities under the Act.  An affidavit has been filed indicating that the possession of the land has not been taken and the land in question continues to be in possession of the appellant and his sons. 3.      Learned counsel for the respondent-State and its functionaries on the other hand contended that the point regarding earlier adjudication was not urged before the High Court and therefore the High Court has rightly decided that in the absence of any specific plea a new plea cannot be taken before it. 4.      It is to be noted that the Act has been replaced under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1999 (in short the ’Repeal Act’). Admittedly the State of Uttar Pradesh has since adopted the provisions of the Repeal Act by a resolution as required under Article 252(2) of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the ’Constitution’). Repealing Act has since come into force in the State of Uttar Pradesh with effect from 18.3.1999. 5.      Section 4 of the Repeal Act reads as follows: http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ""4. Abatement of legal proceedings- All proceedings relating to any order made or purported to be made under the principal Act pending immediately before the commencement of this Act, before any court. tribunal or other authority shall abate; Provided that this section shall not apply to the proceedings relating to Sections 1!, 12, 13 and 14 of the principal Act insofar as such proceedings are relatable to the land, possession of which has been taken over by the State Government or any person duly authorised by the State Government in this behalf or by the competent authority."" 6.      In view of the affidavit filed by the appellant to which no objection has been filed, undisputed position is that the State has not taken the possession over the surplus land. Therefore, the proceedings have to be treated to have abated under Section 4 of the Repeal Act. 7.      That being so, the appeal deserves to be allowed which we direct.","The appellant had challenged the order dated 12.12.1986 (Annexure 4 to the writ petition) passed by the appellate authority under the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act, 1976 (in short the ’Act’) in U.L.C.(Misc.)

" Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice S. B. Majmuder Hon’ble Mr. Justice M. Jagannadha Rao Munilal Verma,  Sr.  Adv.  Devender  Verma  and  Ms.  Naresh Bakshi, Advs. with him for the appellants. P.N.Puri, Adv. for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard learned  counsel for  the parities.  The grievance of  the appellants  before us is that in an appeal filed by  them before the learned additional District Judge, Ferozepur, in  an application  under Order  XLI Rule  27(b), Code  of   Civil  Procedure  (CPC)  the  learned  Additional district Judge  at the  final hearing  of the appeal wrongly felt that  additional evidence  was required  to produced as requested by  the appellants  way of  examination of a hand- writing  expert.  The  High  Court  in  the  impugned  order exercising jurisdiction under Section 115, CPC took the view that the  order of  the Appellate Could not be sustained. In our view  the approach of the High Court in revision at that interim stage  when the appeal was pending for final hearing before  the   learned  Additional  District  Judge  was  not justified and the High Court should not have interfered with the order which was within the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court. The  reason is  obvious. The  Appellate Court hearing the matter  finally could  exercise jurisdiction  one way or the other  under Order  XLI Rule 27 specially clause (b). If the order  was wrong  on merits, it would always be open for the respondent  to challenge  same in accordance with law if an occasion  arises to  carry the  matter in  Second  Appeal after an  appellate decree  is passed.  But at  this interim stage, the  High Court should not have felt itself convinced that the  order was without jurisdiction. Only on this short question, without  expressing any  opinion on the merits the controversy involved  and on the legality of the contentions advanced  by  both  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties regarding additional  evidence, we  allow this  appeal,  set aside the  order of  the High  Court.  In  the  result,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Additional District  Judge, Ferozepur  shall now  decide the appeal on its own merits.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2624 OF 2002 The short question involved in this appeal is as to whether a Typewriter Instructor is a Teacher or not. We have heard the parties at length. According to the University Calender the Teacher shall include Principal, Lecturer, Lecturer in Physical Education, Tutor, Demonstrator, Instructor and Librarian in the service of a Non-Govt. College. It appears that by a letter dated 12.2.1999 an instruction has been issued to clarify the confusion created with regard to the entitlement of vacations by the category of staff such as SLA/JLA/Typewriter Instructor/Tabla Player and Laboratory Attendant as to whether they are entitled to full vacations like Teaching staff or they are non-teaching staff and like any other Government staff they are entitled only to casual leave or other vacations during the year. Clause (1) of the said instructions clearly states that if any University Rules are contrary to the aforesaid instructions they must be amended accordingly. It is stated that the aforesaid Government Circular has been challenged by the respondent before the High Court by filing a writ petition. The High Court has held that the typewriters are entitled to the benefits available to the teaching staff and, therefore, no amendment has been carried out in consonance with the direction contained in the Government order dated 12.2.1999. Having regard to the peculiar facts that some of the respondents have been enjoying the facilities since more than 13 years in accordance with the University Calender we do not want to interfere with the impugned order. We, however, leave the question of law open. We also allow the appellant State to amend the University Calender in terms of the Government order dated 12.2.1999.  Such amendment if any carried out pursuant to the Government order shall be prospective.  If any such amendment is made it shall cover  all cases of the Typewriter Instructors including the case of the respondents herein. This appeal is disposed with the direction indicated above.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Madras High  Court  in  W.P. No.12533/86 dated  November 24,  1994.  The  respondent  and others challenged the validity of Sections 24 and 25 of Cone Workers  and   Cinema   Theatre   Workers   (Regulation   of Employment) Act  (50 of  1981) (for short ’the Act’) and the notification of  Government of India bearing No.35016 issued by Ministry  of Labour on April 30, 1986. The Division Bench while upholding  the validity of the Act has given relief to the respondent to pay their share of the contribution w.e.f. the date of judgment dated November 24, 1994. The  Union   of  India   has  filed  this  appeal.  The controversy is no longer res integra. This Court in District Exhibitors Association  Muzaffarnagar &  Ors.  v.  Union  of India &  Ors. [(1991) 3 SCC 119] upwells the validity of the provisions and  the rules.  However, it  was held  that  the employer’s contribution  should be  made effective  from the date of  the order setting aside the retrospective operation of the  notification. It can thus be concluded that from the date of  the notification  the owners  of the Cinema Theatre are liable  to contribute  their share  and also  entitle to deduct from  the wages of the workmen towards their share of provident fund  and to  have  it  credited  to  the  account maintained by the appropriate authority in that behalf. It is contended for the respondents that the High Court has granted  the relief  taking into consideration that some workmen had  retired and  it would  be inequitable to deduct from  the   meagre  wages   of   existing   employees   with retrospective period.  Therefore, the  High  Court  directed deduction of  their share  from the date of the judgment. It is needless  to mention  that since some of the workmen have already retired  and from  some existing  workmen  deduction from date  of enforcement  of the  notification would  cause great hardship  to them,  so it  cannot be  made to bear the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 burden of  their contribution with retrospective effect from the  date   of  the  notification  towards  their  share  of contribution. To that  extent, the order of the High Court is upheld. As regards  the liability  of the owners of the theaters who approached the High Court, the operation of the notification had stayed  at their  instance. We  find that the High Court was wholly  unjustified in granting the same relief to these owners/licencees. After their writ petitions were dismissed, they were  to bear  the  liability  from  the  date  of  the enforcement of  the notification  as held  by this Court. It is, therefore,  necessary that  from the  date on  which the respective owners  of the theaters or the licencees, who had filed the  writ petition  in the High Court, are made liable to deposit  their share  of contribution  towards  provident fund account under the scheme. We are  issuing the  order under  Article  142  of  the Constitution. The  order of the High Court to that extent is set aside.  The respondent  and all  the theaters owners are directed to  deposit their  share  of  contribution  to  the provident fund  account from  the respective  dates on which they filed  the  writ  petitions  in  the  High  Court.  The appellants should  intimate all  of them  the date  on which they had  filed the writ petitions and call upon them to pay their share of contribution. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed to above extent. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the Madras High Court in W.P. No.12533/86 dated November 24, 1994.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court allowing the application under Section 401 read with Section 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Code’). 3.      The main grievance in support of the petition is that the appellants were not granted opportunity of being heard before the petition was allowed by the learned Judge. 4.      A brief reference to the factual aspects would suffice. Appellant No.1 is the wife of appellant No.2 who is a doctor by profession. Respondent No.1 filed a complaint alleging commission of offences punishable under Sections 323, 342, 382, 386 read with  Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’). The learned Magistrate dismissed the complaint after recording statements of the complainant and two others. Questioning correctness of the order passed by the learned Magistrate, an application for revision was filed before the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, First Track Court V, Alipore, South 24- Parganas. After hearing the revision petitioner-respondent No.1 herein the said revision petition was dismissed. 5.      Before the High Court the revision petition was treated to be one under Section 482 of the Code, though styled as one under Section 401 read with Section 402 of the Code. The High Court allowed the petition and directed the Magistrate to issue process against the appellants. 6.      Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that before the revisional Court the appellants were heard. Initially in the present petition the appellants were impleaded as parties but at the request of respondent No.1, their names were deleted. Learned counsel for the appellants has further submitted that though the respondent No.1 himself had styled the petition as one under Section 401 read with Section 402 of the Code, the High Court erroneously treated it to be a petition under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Section 482 of the Code.  It is clear from the cause title that the case was registered to be one under the criminal revisional jurisdiction and in view of the bar contained in the code second revision was not maintainable. In any event, appellants were not heard before the order was passed. 7.      Learned counsel for respondent No.1 submitted that in the matter of issuance of process the accused has no right to be heard. 8.      There can be no quarrel with the proposition that at the time of issuance of process and taking cognizance the accused has no right to be heard. But in the facts of the instant case before the Revisional Court the appellants were heard. Further, their names were indicated in the cause title, which at the request of respondent No.1 were deleted. 9.      Above being the position the High Court ought to have heard the appellants before deciding the matter. Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and maintainability of the petition before the High Court, we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law. 10.     The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","Appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court allowing the application under Section 401 read with Section 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

" JUDGMENT ORDER We have heard Mr. Madan Mohan Rai who states that he is the husband of the petitioner herein. Pursuant to the order dated 25.8.2005 Mrs. K. Sarada Devi, Adovcate has been appointed as legal aid counsel for the petitioner. She has also been heard by us. We have also perused the contents of the writ petition and the documents annexed therewith. We are satisfied that the case does not call for consideration in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. We are constrained to observe that a number of cases are being filed in this Court wherein the petitioners claim themselves to be freedom fighters and hence entitled to pension under a scheme framed by the Central Government. In most of these cases, the State Governments have found the petitioners’ not entitled to the grant of such pension and, therefore, their cases have not been recommended by the State Governments to the Central Government. By filing petitions under Articles 32 of the Constitution before this Court the State Governments are being noticed to appear and show cause here and also to produce the relevant documents. We feel that such matters, wherever the petitioners have a genuine grievance, can better be dealt with by the High Court. Filing of such petitions in this Court directly by invoking Article 32 of the Constitution has to be discouraged. The writ petition is dismissed with liberty to the petitioner to file an appropriate petition in the High Court, if so advised.","The writ petition is dismissed with liberty to the petitioner to file an appropriate petition in the High Court, if so advised.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel an both sides. Order dated  November 12,  1993 in  O.A. No.1702/93 and 2206/93 of the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal, Madras is in question  before us.  The  respondent  while  working  as Assistant Section  Officer,  Home,  Prohibition  and  Excise Department had  been placed  under suspension.  Departmental inquiry is in process. We are informed that charge sheet was laid for  prosecution for  the offences  of embezzlement and fabrication of  false records etc. and that the offences and the trial of the case is pending. The Tribunal had set aside the departmental  enquiry and  quashed  the  charge  on  the ground of  delay in  initiation of disciplinary proceedings. In the  nature of  the charges,  it would  take long time to detect embezzlement  and fabrication  of false records which should be  done in  secrecy. It  is not necessary to go into the merits  and record  any finding  on the  charge levelled against the  charged officer  since any  finding recorded by this Court  would gravely  prejudice the case of the parties at the  enquiry and  also at the trial. Therefore, we desist from expressing any opinion on merit or recording any of the contentions raised by the counsel on either side. Suffice it to state  that the  Administrative  Tribunal  has  committed grossest error  in its  exercise of the judicial review. The member of  the Administrative  Tribunal appear  to  have  no knowledge of  the  jurisprudence  of  the  service  law  and exercised power  as if  he is an appellate forum de hors the limitation of  judicial review.  This is  one such  instance where a  member had exceeded his power of judicial review in quashing the  suspension  order  and  charges  even  at  the threshold. We  are  coming  across  frequently  such  orders putting heavy pressure on this Court to examine each case in detail. It is high time that it is remedied. The appeal are accordingly allowed and the order of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Tribunal is  set aside.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the High  Court of Allahabad, made on May 10, 1996 in CR No. 352 of  1995. It  is not  necessary to narrate all the facts relating to  the controversy  in execution. It is now not in dispute that  against the  decree of  the trial  Court,  the appeal has  been filed  in the High Court. The appeal is now pending. When  the respondent had taken out execution of the decree of  the trial  Court, the  respondent had  also filed another Revision  No. 56-95  and the  High Court has granted stay on  May 15,  1995  of  the  execution  of  the  decree. Thereafter without  knowledge, the learned counsel appearing for the  appellant, appears  to have made a statement in the executing Court  as well  as  in  the  High  Court  that  no revision  was   filled  against  the  order  passed  by  the executing Court.  As a consequence, a direction was given in the impugned order to enforce the decree and exemplary costs were  awarded.   However,  the   learned  counsel   for  the respondent has  brought to  out notice  that the  Court  has stayed the  execution of  the decree  and the appellant have under threat of contempt executed the sale deed in favour of the respondent.  In view  of the  act  that  sale  deed  has already been  registered in  favour  of  the  respondent  in execution of  the decree, we decline to go into the question of the  legality of  the execution, in spite of the order of stay granted  by the  High Court  in the aforesaid revision. However, whether  the respondent requires to pay at the rate of Rs.  500/- per  sq. yd.  or at  the rate of Rs. 800/- per sq.yd. is  the subject  matter of the dispute in the pending appeal. Under these circumstances, the execution of the sale deed  will   be  subject   to  the  result  in  the  appeal. Accordingly the  imposition of  the exemplary  costs by  the High Court for a sum of Rs. 25,000/- is not warranted on the facts in this case and is accordingly set aside. The appeal  is accordingly allowed to the above extent. No costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","This appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the High  Court of Allahabad, made on May 10, 1996 in CR No. 352 of 1995.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties. The respondent  was a  driver in  the  service  of  the Punjab Roadways,  Jallandhar. There  was an  accident to the bus he  was driving  on 2.7.86.  Number of  passengers  were injured and the bus damaged. A F.I.R. WAS issued against the respondent under  Section 304-A  of the  I.P.C. and  certain other provisions.  He was  also suspended pending inquiry. A memo of  charges was  issued to  him  proposing  to  hold  a disciplinary inquiry  on the  charges of causing loss to the Corporation by  driving the  bus rashly  and negligently. An Inquiry Officer,  Shri R.S. Sharma, was appointed. White the proceedings were  pending before  the Inquiry  Officer,  the Criminal Court  acquitted the  respondent under its judgment and order  dated 19.10.1988.  After perusing the judgment of the Criminal Court, a fresh disciplinary inquiry was ordered against the respondent for which purpose a different Inquiry Officer  was   appointed.  The   disciplinary  inquiry   was accordingly held  and on  the basis  of the  report  of  the Inquiry Officer  the respondent  was  found  guilty  of  the charges and dismissed from service. The respondent  instituted a  suit in the Court of Sub- Judge, Jallandhar  for  a  declaration  that  the  order  of dismissal  was   void  and  illegal  and  for  consequential benefits. The  learned Subordinate  Judge dismissed the suit but  in   appeal  the  learned  District  Judge  upheld  the respondent’s claim.  The order  of  dismissal  was  declared illegal and  the respondent  was held  entitled to  all  the benefits flowing  from such  declaration. The  second appeal preferred by  the Corporation  and the  State of  Punjab was dismissed in limine by the High Court. The main  ground upon  which the learned District Judge has decreed  the respondent’s  suit is  that inasmuch as the first Inquiry  Officer (Shri  R.S.Sharma) had  submitted his report  which   report  was   also  acted  upon,  no  second disciplinary inquiry  could have  been ordered, particularly after acquittal  by the  Criminal Court.  We called upon the learned counsel  for the respondent before us to show us the evidence or the material on the basis of which the Appellate http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court has  held that the first Inquiry Officer had submitted his report  after the  conclusion of the inquiry and that it was also  acted upon.  We also  asked the learned counsel to clarify that  do the  words  ""the  inquiry  report  of  Shri R.S.Sharma has  been acted  upon  under  Rule  9.1""  in  the Judgment of  the learned  District Judge,  mean. The learned counsel for  the respondent  is  unable  to  point  out  any evidence or  explain the  said observation.  Indeed  in  the written submissions  filed  by  the  learned  counsel,  Shri U.S.Prasad, it  is stated  ""in all fairness I must point out to your Lordships that Inquiry Report and order imposing the punishment is  not available"".  The basis of the judgment of the first Appellate Court thus becomes untenable. We are,  however, not inclined to dispose of the matter finally at  this stage.  We have  not been shown the copy of the judgment  and order of the Criminal Court acquitting the respondent. We  have also  not been  shown  the  proceedings ordering the fresh inquiry or the reasons in which the fresh disciplinary inquiry was ordered, after the acquittal of the Criminal  Court.   These   matters   may   require   further examination. Accordingly  we allow  the appeal and set aside the judgment  of the High Court to request the High Court to admit the  second appeal  preferred by  the appellants’  and dispose it of on merits in accordance with law.","A F.I.R. was issued against the respondent under Section 304-A of the I.P.C. and  certain other provisions.

" THE 28TH DAY OF NOVEMBER 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Vimal Dave, Adv. for the appellant S.C.Patel, Adv. for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered Pragji Anandji  and Damji  Anandji are  brothers. House Nos. 247  & 248  situated in  Anjar  are  the  joint  family properties. It  would appear  that  on  December  18,  1956, Anandji, their  father  and  Damji  the  2nd  defendant  had mortgaged these  properties which  admittedly were  redeemed with their consent as evinced under Ex.27, a compromise. The appellant’s father Pragji had claimed that the consideration for redemption  of the  first mortgage  was their money. The finding recorded by all the courts is that consideration for redemption of  that mortgage  was by  hypothecation  on  the second  occasion   of  the  said  properties  in  favour  of Mansukhlal Ambalal,  the first  defendant. Pragji  had filed Suit No.  66/69 for  a declaration  that the second mortgage dated September  30, 1958 executed by damji and Anandji does not bind him. He also sought partition and possession of his half share  in the  said properties.  He also  set up a plea that after  the redemption  of the first mortgage, there was an oral  partition in  which House No. 248 fell to his share and House  No.247 fell  to the share of Damji. But that plea was negatived  by all  the courts.  The consequence would be that House  Nos.247 are  joint family  properties  in  which Pragji, the  father of  the appellant  and Damji, the second defendant, have  equal share in the properties. The findings recorded by  the courts  below is  that the  mortgage  dated September 30, 1958 binds the parties. In view of these findings, the question is: whether the appellant is  entitled to the partition of the properties in two equal shares and allotment of one such share? In view of the finding that both the houses are joint family properties succeeded by Pragji and Damji, the brothers, they are liable to partition. However, it would be subject to the redemption of the  mortgage under  Ex.  38  dated  September  30,  1958 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 executed in  favour  of  Mansukhlal,  the  first  defendant. Accordingly, there  is a preliminary decree for partition of the houses  in two equal shares and one such share should be allotted to  the appellant.  It is  open  to  the  appellant before executing  the preliminary  decree  and  passing  the final decree  to have  the mortgage  executed,  Ex.  38,  in favour of  Mansukhlal redeemed  by paying  the mortgage debt and then  have  the  properties  partitioned  in  meets  and bounds. In  case the second defendant does not pay his share in the  mortgage debt,  the entire  amount should be paid by the appellant  in which  event the  second defendant  is not entitled  to   his  share   engrafted  in   the  stamps  and registeration  and   the  appellant   may  seek  appropriate direction from the trial Court for payment. The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed.  But,  in  the circumstances, without cost.","Pragji and Damji Anandji are brothers. House Nos. 247 and 248 in Anjar are joint family properties.

" O R D E R Leave granted. These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the High  Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench made  on February 4, 1994 in Civil Misc. Appeal Nos. 294/88 and 311/68. The admitted  position is  that pursuant to a agreement the respondent  are alleged  to have come into possession of the suit  property for  running the  business or a hotel. It is the  case of the respondents their possession and running of the  business. On  the other  hand, it is the case of the appellant  that   it  is  his  exclusive  property  and  the respondents have no manner of right to come into possession. Consequently, the  respondents filed  the suit for perpetual injunction restraining  the appellant  from interfering with their possession  and running of the business. Pending suit, both the  parties came to file  applications. The appellants filed  an  application  under  Order  40,  Rule  1  CPC  for appointment  of   a  Receiver   and  respondent   filed   an application under  Order 39  Rule  1  for  an    ad  interim injunction. Though  the trial Court had refused to issue the direction for  appointment of  Receiver, it  had  issued  an injunction against   the  respondents restraining  them from running the business. But, on appeal, the district Court has set aside   the direction to  run the business and dismissed the application   for  appointment of Receiver which came to be affirmed   by  the High   Court.  The High  Court has set aside the  appointment of  the Receiver  qua  the  property. Thus, these appeals by special leave. In     view  of  the  fact  that  the  respondents  are continuing, as alleged, to be under an agreement, they would obviously  act   as  custodia  legis  pending  the  suit  as Receivers on  behalf of the Court. But any rights accrued or claimed by  them will  be subject to the result in the suit. The claim for enhancement of the rentals cannot be gone into in this  case and  it is  de hors  the relief  in the  suit. Under these circumstances, if it is permissible, appropriate steps may  be taken  by the  appellant  in  any  appropriate proceedings as per law.

" J U D G M E N T G.P. Mathur, J. This appeal, by special leave, has been filed challenging the judgment and order dated 7.5.2003 of High Court of Madhya Pradesh by which the Civil Revision filed by Bhanu Kumar Jain was dismissed. 2.      The election for the Office of Mayor, Municipal Corporation of Indore, was notified on 25.11.1999.  The election was held on 27.12.1999 and the result was declared on 3.1.2000 wherein Shri Kailash Vijayvargiya, respondent No. 3, was elected as Mayor.  One Bhanu Kumar Jain filed an election petition challenging the election of Shri Kailash Vijayvargiya as Mayor on several grounds and the principal ground taken was that he being a sitting member of the Legislative Assembly, was disqualified for holding the Office of Mayor of a corporation under the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956.  The election petition was dismissed by the XII Additional District Judge, Indore, by the judgment and order dated 11.4.2002. Bhanu Kumar Jain then filed a civil revision under Section 441-F of the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 in the High Court, which was also dismissed by the judgment and order dated 7.5.2003, which is the subject-matter of challenge in the present appeal. 3.      The term of a Mayor under the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 is five years and it is fairly admitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the term of Shri Kailash Vijayvargiya has already come to an end.  In these circumstances, no effective relief can be granted in the present appeal and the same has become infructuous by passage of time. 4.      Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that a direction be issued that an election petition challenging the election of a returned candidate should be decided expeditiously by the trial court and the revision petition preferred in the High Court should also be disposed of as expeditiously as possible.  The appellant has not filed copy of the order sheet of the trial court or of the High Court, which could give some indication as to who is responsible for the delay in the final disposal of the matter.  Even the judgment of the trial court has not been filed along with the special leave petition.  In absence of complete material having been placed on record, it will not be proper for us to issue any direction in this regard. 5.      Learned counsel for the appellant has also submitted that this Court should issue directions for an appropriate amendment in the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 so that a person may be debarred from simultaneously holding two elected offices, namely that of a member of the Legislative Assembly and also of Mayor of a Municipal Corporation.  In our opinion, this is a matter of policy for the elected representatives of people to decide and no direction in this http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 regard can be issued by the court.  That apart this Court cannot issue any direction to the Legislature to make any particular kind of enactment.  Under our constitutional scheme Parliament and Legislative Assemblies exercise sovereign power to enact laws and no outside power or authority can issue a direction to enact a particular piece of legislation.  In Supreme Court Employees Welfare Association vs. Union of India (1989) 4 SCC 187 (para 51) it has been held that no court can direct a legislature to enact a particular law. Similarly, when an executive authority exercises a legislative power by way of a subordinate legislation pursuant to the delegated authority of a legislature, such executive authority cannot be asked to enact a law which it has been empowered to do under the delegated legislative authority.  This view has been reiterated in State of J & K vs. A.R. Zakki 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 548.  In A.K. Roy vs. Union of India (1982) 1 SCC 271, it was held that no mandamus can be issued to enforce an Act which has been passed by the legislature. Therefore, the submission made by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be accepted. 6.      The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" JUDGMENT CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6313 of 2001 A.K.MATHUR,J. 1.      This appeal is directed against the order dated 11.7.2000 passed by the  Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court whereby the Division Bench has ordered the compensation in sum of Rs. 1,65,000/- towards dependency and Rs. 10,000/- for the loss of estate & funeral expenses. Aggrieved against this order, the present appeal  was preferred by the appellant for suitable enhancement of the compensation. Brief facts which are necessary for the disposal of this appeal are as under: 2.      That one Hazi Mohammed Haneef died in a motor accident on 30.3.1993 when a tempo bearing No. CAA 6591 dashed   against the motorcycle  (KA-01-H-7054) which he was riding.  He ultimately succumbed to injuries and died.  Therefore, the  claimants (the parents of the deceased) filed MVC No. 1039/1993 claiming compensation of Rs.15,12,000/- under the various heads. The Tribunal allowed the claim petition in part by judgment and award dated 23.9.1996 and held that accident took  place due to  negligent driving of the tempo bearing No. CAA 6591 and held that  claimants were entitled to compensation of Rs.1,75,000/- with interest at 6% p.a. from  the date of petition to the date of realization.    The compensation amount awarded in sum of Rs. 1,65,000/- towards loss of dependency and Rs. 10,000/- towards loss of estate & funeral expenses. 3.      Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the deceased was 20 years of age and  was a bachelor.  His parents were  aged 47 years and 42 years respectively.   The  deceased was studying in First Year B.Com. course and  he was also the proprietor of a business carried under the name  and style of H.S. Traders and  was an income-tax assessee.  The deceased had  an  income of Rs. 31,494/- in his business and had paid the income-tax on that.    The Tribunal had erroneously  deducted 50%  towards his personal, living expenses and the contribution to the family/dependency worked out to   Rs. 15,000/- per annum.  The Tribunal applied multiplier of 11, looking to the age of the parents and  arrived at the total loss of dependency at Rs. 1,65,000/-.    Learned counsel submitted that the assessment made by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court was totally erroneous.  The incumbent was a bachelor,  therefore, he could not spend 50% of his income on himself. But three-fourth of the income was contributed to the family and , therefore, the dependency assessed by the Tribunal and by the High Court for a sum of Rs. 15,000/- was not correct.  It  was also submitted that the multiplier of 11 applied by the Tribunal was also not correct. 4.       After hearing learned counsel for the parties,  we are of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 opinion that the view taken by the High Court & Tribunal is not correct. The incumbent  was a bachelor and he could not have spent more than 1/3rd of his total income for personal use and rest of the amount earned by him would certainly go to the family kitty. Therefore, determining the  loss of dependency by  50%  was not correct. Therefore,  we assess that he must be spending 1/3rd towards personal use and contributing 2/3rd of his  income to his family. Therefore, we work out that Rs. 30,000/- earned by him per annum. The loss of dependency was 2/3rd i.e. Rs. 20,000/- .  The multiplier of  ’11’  applied for loss of dependency was also not correct and as per schedule appended to the  Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 it should  be ’12’.  Applying the multiplier of 12 the total loss of dependency will be Rs. 20,000/-x 12 =  Rs. 2,40,000/- and Rs, 10,000/- towards loss of estate & funeral expenses, the total compensation comes to Rs. 2,50,000/- and  incumbent is entitled for interest @ 9/% per annum from the date of the petition.    The  appeal is allowed with the  aforesaid modification.  If any amount had already been paid to the claimant then that amount  may be deducted from the total amount. Consequently, the appeal is allowed in part with no order as to costs.","Hazi Mohammed Haneef died in a motor accident on 30.3.1993 when a tempo bearing No. CAA 6591 dashed against the motorcycle he was riding.

In   preparation  of   the  inter-se  seniority,  the appellant claimed  seniority over  the  respondents  on  the ground that  he had  completed his  training earlier to them and   as per  Rule 303  (1)(a) of  the Railway Establishment Code, the  seniority has  to be  reckoned from  the date  of completion of  the training  and joining the post. Since the appellant was  sent for training of December 23, 1985 to the respondents. The  Tribunal in  the order  under appeal,  has said that  the respondents, though were selected and seniors in the order of ranking, i.e. merits, since the enquiry into the antecedents  was pending,  they could  not be  sent  for training earlier  to the  appellant. Therefor, the appellant cannot scale a march over them in the order of seniority. Learned counsel  for the appellant contended that as per the Rule then  in  vogue,  there  was  no  option  left  to  the authorities to determine the inter se seniority in the light of Rule 303(1)(a) of the code, but on May 31, 1993, the Rule came to  be amended  amplifying what  latent with  potential mischief for  the arbitrary  exercise of power in picking up and sending  the  candidates  batch-wise  for  training  and giving them  accelerated seniority  over the  candidates who were put  blow in  the order  of select  list by the Railway Recruitment Board  or any  of the  competent authority  that rule cannot  be applied to the case of the appellant and the respondents as  the rule  in vogue  in 1985  alone has to be considered. though  prima  facial  we  found  force  in  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 contention of  the learned counsel for the appellant, but on deeper consideration  of the  legality and  justice, we find that there  is no  force in  the contention.  It is  not  in dispute that the respondent Nos.6 and 7 were selected in the same batch and rank; in the order of merit they were seniors to the  appellant. Under there circumstances, since they had not been  sent for training, necessarily their ranking given in the  list of candidates selected in the order of merit by the recruitment  board cannot  be given  a  go-by  and  they cannot be  given accelerated  seniority to the appellant and the like by picking and choosing the persons as per the whim of the  authorities empowered  to send them for training. It is settled  legal position  that  the  order  of  merit  and ranking given  by the Recruitment Board should be maintained when more  than one  persons are selected, the same inter se seniority should  be maintained for future promotions unless Rules prescribe  passing of departmental test as a condition for confirmation  but was  not passed  as  on  the  date  of determining   of    inter   se    seniority.   Under   these circumstances, the  Tribunal was  justified and right in not directing the  respondent give  seniority to  the  appellant over the  respondents. Therefore,  the order of the Tribunal does not warrant interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The appellant claimed seniority over the respondents on the ground that he had completed his training earlier to them. As per Rule 303 (1)(a) of the Railway Establishment Code, the seniority has to be reckoned from the date of completion of the training and joining the post. The Tribunal in the order  under appeal, has said that the respondents, though were selected and seniors in theorder of ranking, i.e. merits, could not be given accelerated seniority to the appellant.",special leave petitions,29.32
" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil  Appeal No. 322 of 1970. From the  Judgment and  Decree dated  25-3-1969 of  the Madras High Court in Appeal No. 1195 of 1970. U.R. Lalit, P.H. Parekh and Miss Manik Tarkunde for the Appellant. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KOSHAL J.  A preliminary  objection has  been raised by Mr. Rangam to the effect that the certificate granted by the court under sub-clauses (a) and (c) of clause (1) of Article 133 of the Constitution of India, as it then stood, does not conform to legal requirements in as much as- (a)  it does  not specify the substantial question http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of law  which the  High Court  states require determination; and (b)   no reasons in support of the issuance of the certificate appear therein. 949 The preliminary  objection is  well founded  in view of the decisions  of this  Court  in  Sohan  Lal  Naraindas  v. Laxmidas Raghunath  Gadit and  in Sardar  Bahadur  S.  Indra Singh Trust v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal. Faced with  this situation Mr. Lalit wanted us to treat the appeal  as one  by special  leave and  prayed that  such leave be  granted now  after condoning the delay. That would have been  certainly a reasonable course to follow if it was made out  that a substantial question of law really requires determination. We  have gone  through the  impugned judgment and find  that no  such question  is involved  at  all.  We, therefore, refuse  special  leave,  revoke  the  certificate granted by the High Court and dismiss the appeal but with no order as to costs. P.B.R.

" O R D E R We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short,  the ’Act’) was published on July 11, 1953. Successive  declaration under  Section 6  came  to  be published in  the year  1955-56. Thereafter,  as many  as 40 awards have  been passed  determining the  compensation.  In this case  notice was issued by the second respondent on May 15, 1963  under Section  9 of  the Act pursuant to which the petitioner had  filed his  objections. Thereafter, the award came to  be  made  on  13.3.1985.  He  filed  writ  petition challenging the  validity of  the notification under Section 4(1)  and   the  declaration   under  Section  6.    Primary contention  raised   in  the  writ  petition  was  that  the petitioner had  not been  given  notice  under  Section  5-A whereas being a sub-lessee, he was an interested person. The High Court  was not  impressed with the argument. He further contended that  there was  inordinate delay  in passing  the award. On  that account, notification under Section 4(1) and declaration under  Section 6  were required to be set aside. That contention was also negatived. The learned single Judge by judgment  dated February  16,  1996  dismissed  the  writ petition. On  appeal, the  Division Bench  in  the  impugned order dated  June 12, 1996 in Appeal No.423/96 confirmed the same. The learned  counsel for  the petitioner contended that since the  land in  an extent  of 567 acres was acquired for public purpose,  namely, establishment  of IIT, transfer  of 60 acres  of land to NITIE by the IIT by a resolution of the Government, viz.,  95 of  1970,  dated  June  26,  1970  was clearly  a   fraud  on   public  purpose.   Therefore,   the acquisition is  not valid  in law.  In support  thereof, the learned counsel  placed reliance  on the  judgment of Bombay High Court  in The  Industrial Development  & Investment Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. [AIR 1989 Bom.156] and of  Delhi High  Court in Union of India vs. Nand Kishore http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 [AIR 1982 Delhi 462]. We find no force in the contention. It is settled law that the land acquired for public purpose can be  transferred   to  another   public  purpose.   Paramount consideration will  be service  of the  public purpose.  The NITIE is  also one  of  the  public  institutions  imparting technical   education    in   the    region.   Under   these circumstances, the  transfer of 60.8312 acres of land handed over to  NITIE  pursuant  to  the  resolution  made  by  the Government is  not vitiated  by any  error of  law  nor  the notification under  Section 4(1)  and declaration  published under Section  6 become  bad in law. The aforesaid decisions bear no relevance. It is  next contended  that in  view of  the inordinate delay in  passing  the  award,  the  acquisition  should  be required to  be quashed. We find no force in the contention. It is  seen that  in Maharashtra  State, as  per  the  rules prevailing, pursuant  to the  notice   under Section  5-A  a personal hearing  is required to be given to all the owners. In a  massive acquisition  like this, it would be well neigh impossible to the Land Acquisition Officer to pass the award within a  short span  of time.  Under  these  circumstances, necessarily delay  had occasioned in passing the awards. The petitioner had  evoked at  a belated  stage in  1985,  after practically 22 years. The High Court was, therefore, clearly right in refusing to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The SLP is accordingly dismissed.","Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was published on July 11, 1953. As many as 40 awards have been passed determining the compensation.

" O R D E R The Land  Acquisition Officer divided the land into two blocks,  i.e.,   Block  ‘A’   and  Block   ‘B’  and  awarded Rs.25,000/- per  acre for Block ‘A’ and Rs.15,000/- per acre for Block  ‘B’. The  Reference Court  made four  blocks  and awarded compensation  @ Rs.10/- per sq. yard for first Block and  proportionately  decreased  the  value  for  the  other blocks. On  appeal, the  High Court made the uniform rate of Rs.10/- per  sq. yard  for entire  land and  disposed of the appeals accordingly.  Feeling aggrieved,  the appellant  has filed this appeal from that batch by special leave. Mr.  Rohtagi,   learned  counsel   for  the  appellant, strenuously contended  that the  value of  the land  is much more than  what was  given and  it is  a  matter  where  the appellant is  entitled to get higher compensation. We do not find any  force in  this contention.  Whether  the  land  is capable of  fetching higher  market value than @ Rs.10/- per sq. yard depends on pure appreciation of evidence on record. The reference  court and learned Single Judge have gone into the question  and held  that the  land can fetch the maximum price of  Rs.10/- per  sq. yard  for the  entire zone to the extent of  19 Bighas  and 3 Biswas. The State Government did not file  any appeal in this Court of High Court. It being a pure question of fact on appreciation of evidence, we cannot re-appreciate the evidence and come to our own conclusion in the absence of application of any wrong principle of law. It is next contended that the appellant had constructed a house  at  a  cost  of  Rs.20,000/-  but  only  a  sum  of Rs.6,000/- was  awarded and,  therefore, he  is entitled for higher compensation.  This also  is based  on factual matrix and appreciation  of evidence  by all  the courts. We do not think that we would be justified to interfere with the value fixed at Rs.6,000/- for the construction of house. The  appeal  is  accordingly  dismissed,  but,  in  the circumstances, without costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","Land  Acquisition Officer divided the land into two blocks,  i.e.,   Block  ‘A’ and Block   ’B’ The Reference Court awarded compensation @ Rs.10/- per sq. yard for first Block and proportionately  decreased the value for the other blocks.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.8205 OF 2001 This appeal filed by the Union of India has been pending since 2001.  On 16.07.2001 this Court issued notice and stayed the impugned order of the High Court.  On 29.11.2001 leave was granted and stay was ordered to be continued. The matter called on yesterday for hearing. As none appeared for the responent, it was passed over for the day. Today also none appears on behalf of the respondent. In view of the aforesaid reason and having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we propose to dispose of the appeal on merits. Briefly stated facts are : The respondent’s husband late Shri Harishanker Pramanik was working as U.D.C. He died in harness on 11.05.1987. On 18.08.1987 the respondent filed an application for appointment of her second son on compassionate ground on the post of U.D.C. However, the said  application   was withdrawn  on 23.11.1987.  Another application was filed for appointment of her daughter Ms. Kalyani Pramanik. It is not disputed that the first son of Late Harishanker Pramanik is employed in the State Bank of India. Shri Dipankar Pramanik, second son was employed in some organisation but  living separately. The appellant by an order dated 24.08.1988 requested the respondent to submit an affidavit that her son is living separately.  On 08.12.1990 the appellant also issued a reminder to the respondent but the query was never replied.  However, the respondent filed a writ petition in 1991 praying the relief for compassionate appointment.  The writ petition was allowed by the learned Single Judge. On appeal the Division Bench affirmed the order of the learned Single Judge. Hence this appeal by special leave. By now it is well settled principle of law  that the purpose of compassionate appointment on the death of the bread winner of the family is to ameliorate the immediate needs of the economic condition of the family.  In the instant case the husband of the respondent died on 11.09.1987 and the respondent filed writ petition in 1991 after a long gap of four years.  The purpose for compassionate appointment is to ameliorate  the economic condition of the family immediately due to the death of sole bread winner of the family. If the family could survive for so many years there was no need to appoint the member of the deceased’s family on compassionate ground.  It also appears that the first son of the respondent is employed in State Bank of India and second son is also employed in some organisation. This was not denied by the respondent. In view thereof, both the learned Single Judge and Division Bench fell in error in directing the appellant to appoint a son of the respondent on compassionate ground. The orders of the learned Single Judge and Division Bench are accordingly set aside.  This appeal is allowed. No costs. The writ petition filed by the respondent stands dismissed.","The appeal filed by the Union of India has been pending since 2001. The matter called on yesterday for hearing.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NO.1001 OF 2002 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Patna High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants.  The writ petition was filed challenging vires of certain provisions of Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1961 (in short ’the Act’).  The writ petition filed by the appellants was dismissed on the ground that no return was filed, and after preparation of draft statements they could have got opportunity to file objection. It was held that the writ petition was filed challenging vires of an enactment which was included in 9th Schedule of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the ’Constitution’). 2.       In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellants submitted that since the vires of certain provision were being challenged and the amendment to Section 29 of the Act was under challenge, the question of filing return did not arise.  Further it was submitted that the amendment was not included in the 9th Schedule as was observed by the High Court. Earlier, all the writ petitioners were granted exemption under Section 29(2) (a)(ii) of the Act to hold an extra unit required for the purpose of performing religious rites and its maintenance but by the amendment the same was taken away. 3.      Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted that though the amendment was not part of the 9th Schedule to the Constitution, yet the effect of the amendment is that the power to exempt stood deleted with retrospective effect. 4.       Prayers in the writ petition were to the following effect: ""It is therefore, prayed that your Lordships may graciously be pleased to admit this application, issue Rule NISI against the respondents calling upon them to show-cause as to why the Section 2 of the impugned ordinance (Annexure 1) and the directions contained in Annexure 2 be declared ultra http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 vires of the Constitution of India and quashed after hearing the party or parties, rule may be made absolute; And/or ii)     That such order, writ, direction or order may be passed to your Lordships as may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case."" 5.       Subsequently, the prayers were amended in the following terms: ""It is, therefore, prayed that the prayed portion of the writ application be kindly permitted to be amended as followed in the light of the facts stated above:- ""That after first prayer in the writ petition, the following be added:- RULE NISI be also issued against the respondents calling upon them to show cause as to why Section 2 of the impugned Bihar Act 8 of 1997 (Annexure 3 and the directions contained in para 5 (Gha)(vi) of the Annexure 4 be not declared ultra vires the Constitution of India and quashed and after hearing the parties RULE NISI be made absolute."" 6.      Since the High Court has not applied its mind to the challenge raised and has erroneously referred to the 9th Schedule to the Constitution, it would be appropriate to set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh consideration in accordance with law. Since the writ petition is of the year 1995, the High Court is requested to take up the matter early and decide the writ petition as early as practicable, preferably by the end of October, 2008. 7.

Since under the covenant, the  predecessor-in-interest was  entitled toonly one renewal,  after the first renewal, she had  no  right. Rejection of  her application for assignment isquite legal.

" ORDER 1.     The  appellant  is the  daughter  of  the  respondent through  second wife. Admittedly, her mother  inherited  the properties of her maternal grandfather. The appellant is the only  issue to her mother. When her mother  died  intestate, the  respondent-husband  filed the partition suit  No.39  of 1979 in the Court of Special Sub-Judge, Ranchi claiming half the  share  as  class-l heir of his wife.  The  trial  court dismissed  the Suit on the ground that during the life  time of  the  mother  of the appellant, she  had  bequeathed  the properties  to  the  appellant under a gift  deed  and  that therefore,  the decree cannot be granted as she  died  after she was divested of her possession. On appeal, the  District Judge  reversed  the decree and held that the  gift  is  not valid and that the appellant and respondent arc class1 heirs and  decreed  the  suit for partition in  equal  moiety.  In Second  Appeal  No.  1 71 82, by Judgment  of  Decree  dated 9.11.1983  the  High  Coral dismissed the  same.  Thus  this appeal by special leave. 2.     The facts are not in dispute, namely, the  mother  of the  appellant inherited the suit property from her  father. Section  15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 regulates  the succession  to the estate of female Hindus. Sub-Section  (1) provides  that  ""the  property  of  a  female  Hindu   dying intestate  shall devolve according to the rules set  out  in Section 16 ""- (a)  firstly,  upon  the  sons  and  daughters (including  the children of  any  pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband; (b)  secondly,  upon  the  heirs  of  the husband; and so on in the order specified. But  sub-section (2) with non-obstante clause  excludes  the applicability  of Subsection (1). Clause (a) of  Sub-Section (2) provides that; ""(a) any property inherited by a female  Hindu from  her father or mother shall  devolve,  in the  absence  of any son or  daughter  of  the deceased  (including the children of any  pre- deceased son of daughter), not upon the  other heirs  referred to in sub-section (1)  in  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 order specified therein, but upon the heirs of the father;"" (clause (b) is not relevant, hence omitted). 3.     A  reading  thereof clearly indicates  that  for  the property  inherited  by a female Hindu from  her  father  or mother,  in  other  words female’s  paternal  side,  in  the absence of her son, daughter or children of the pre-deceased son  or daughter, the succession opens to the heirs  of  the father  or  mother  and not to class-l heirs  in  the  order specified in sub-section (1) of Section l5 and in the  order of  Section  16.   In  other words,  the  children  and  the children  of the pre-deceased son or daughter of  the  Hindu female  alone  are  entitled to  get  such  property.  Thus, husband stands excluded from the succession to the  property inherited   by   female  Hindu  from  her   father’s   side, Accordingly, we hold that since the mother of the  appellant had  inherited the suit property from her  grandfather,  her husband-respondent stood excluded from intestate  succession to  the  estate left by her The courts below  obviously  had overlooked 20 the  provision in Section 15, in particular Sub-Section  (2) thereof, and illegally granted a decree. 4.     The appeal is accordingly allowed. The decree of  the High Court in the Second Appeal and that the appellate court in  the  First Appeal are set aside.  Though  for  different reasons, the decree of the trial court stands confirmed, but in the circumstances, without costs. 21","When her mother died intestate, the respondent-husband filed the partition suit.

In this case  the contract now sought to be relied upon is only to relieve  distress warrant pending disposal of the dispute in the  High Court.  Therefore, it  cannot be construed that there is  any contract  between the  Union of  India and the Municipality. In  view of the fact that the Municipality has no right  to demand service charges from the Union of India, the demand  made by  the Municipality is clearly ultra vires its power. It is true that earlier W.P. No.2844/92 was filed and was  dismissed by  the High  Court and the special leave was refused by this Court on the ground of gross delay. It is  now settled  law that the summary dismissal does not constitute  res judicata  for deciding  the controversy. Moreover, this  being recurring  liability  which  is  ultra http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 vires the  power, earlier summary dismissal of the case does not operate as a res judicata. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. Writ  is issued as prayed for.  Whatever amount  has been paid by now cannot be recovered from the Municipality, No costs.","The respondent-Municipality had  made  a consolidated outstanding demand for a sum of Rs.1,01,501/ for years 1993- 94,  1994-95.

" JUDGMENT Nanavati,J. This appeal filed by the original owner of th  esuit land  is  directed against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay in Second Appeal No. 221/83. Pursuant to an agreement of sale, the appellant sold the suit land to the respondents  under  a  registered  sale deed.  On  the  basis  of  the  sale  in  their  favour  the respondents filed a suit for possession in the Court of  the Civil  judge, Junior division, khed. The Trial Court decreed the suit in spite of the objection raised by  the  plaintiff that  the  sale  transaction  was  void  as  the  land was a fragment and sale of such and is prohibited under The Bombay Prevention of Fragmentation and  Consolidation  of  Holdings Act, 1947. Aggreived  by  the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court the appellant preferred an appeal to  the  Court of Extra Assistant  Judge.    Pune.    The learned Assistant Judge allowed the appeal as he was of the opinion  that  the sale  transaction was void and therefore the respondents did not derive  any  title  to  the  land   thereunder.      The respondents  approached  the High Court and their appeal has been allowed. The only contention raised by  the  learned  counsel for the appellant is that the land being a agent the sale in favour  of  the  respondents  was  void and therefore it was rightly declared by the first Appellate Court to be so.   We find no   substance  in  this  contention.    The  Competent Authority, on a reference being made  to  it  by  the  Trial Court  under  Section 36B of the Act, had held that the sale is valid.  The High Court was  therefore  right  in  holding that  it  was not open to the First Appellate Court, being a Civil Court, to go behind the order passed by the  competent authority.    Section   36   A   of  the  Act  clearly  bars jurisdiction of the Civil Court to settle,  decide  or  deal with  any  question which is by or under the Act required to be settled, decided or dealt with by the State Government or any officer or authority.

Tunnel by  the beas-Sutlej  Link Project.  The land Acquisition Officer  in his  award dated  June  26;27,  1968 classified the  lands into  9 items  [mentioned at page 4 of the Paper Book] and granted compensation at the rate varying between Rs.2,000/-  to Rs.5,000/-  per bigha.  On reference, the Additional  District Judge  confirmed the  award of  the Collector.  On   appeal,  in  the  impugned  judgment  dated December 31,  1982,  the  Division  Bench  in  RFA  No.19/70 confirmed the same Thus, this appeal by special leave. Admittedly, the  appellant’s claim  is for compensation at the  rate of Rs.15,000/- per bisha. The classification of the land  and the  amount awarded  by  the  Collector  would indicate that  in respect  of Kohli I, Begicha and Abadi Deh lands, he granted 2,000/- per bigha; in respect of the lands B-1, he  granted what  was asked  for, namely  Rs.1500/- per bigha. For  Konli- II  he granted  Rs.1250/- per  bigha; for item 5  B-II, he granted Rs.1000/- per bigha; for banjar and uncultivated lands, he granted Rs.500/- per bigha. It is one of the  rarest cases  where the Land Acquisition Officer has granted fair  compensation. The  question, however,  arises: whether it  is a case For further enhancement? The appellant relied upon  five sales  instances of a small extent of land ranging between  6 biswas  and 18  biswas spoken  to by  the witnesses as  discussed by  the High  Court. These lands are situated in  the Abadi,  namely, village itself. Under those circumstances, those  sale deeds  do not form any reasonable basis to  determine higher  compensation for the vast extent of 221  bighas of  land. The test that the Court is required to adopt  is whether a willing prudent purchaser in the open market would  be prepared  to offer compensation at the rate which the  Court  proposes  to  determine  in  a  compulsory acquisition. In  this case,  the  courts  have  adopted  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 correct standard  and were  not  inclined  to  come  to  the conclusion that  the lands  would fetch higher than what was determined by  the Land  Acquisition  Officer.  Under  these circumstances, the courts below have nov committed any error of  principle   of  law  in  determining  the  compensation, warranting interference.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE,  JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal  No.  225  of 1961. Appeal  from the judgment and order dated October 24,  1958, of the Bombay High Court in No, 50 of 1958, 575 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Ganpat Rai, for the appellant. M.   S. K. Sastri and M. S. Narasimhan, for the repondents. 1962.  April 30.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR,  J.  This is an appeal on a certificate of  the  High Court under Art. 133(1) (e) of the Constitution against  the judgment  and  order  of  the High  Court  of  Bombay.   The appellant was the judgement-debtor and the decree-holder  is the respondent. The decree was passed in August 26, 1931 in Summary Suit No. 3437  of  1930  by the High Court of  Bombay  against  three defendants  who were resident & of Parbhani district in  the former State of Hyderabad.  Before the decree was passed the appellant  had  applied for leave to defend  and  leave  was conditionally  granted  on his depositing  Rs.  5,000/within four weeks.  This, he did not do and on his failure to do as an ex-parte decree was granted for Rs. 52,032-7-0  including costs  and future interest at 6% per annum.   The  appellant did  not  file  any  written  statement.   The  decree   was transferred  for execution to the District Judge,  Bhir,  in Hyderabad States.  The respondent took out execution on June 18, 1954 in the Court of the District Judge, Bhir, to  which objection  was  taken by the appellant, inter alia,  on  the ground that he had not submitted to the jurisdiction of  the Bombay  High Court which was a foreign court  and  therefore the decree was a foreign decree and could not be executed in the  Court at Bhir.  This objection was overruled.   Against that  order  appeal was taken to the High Court and  it  was held  by that Court on July 29, 1958 that the appellant  had submitted  to the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court  and the  appeal  was therefore dismissed and the  order  of  the Executing Court upheld.  The 576 Letters Patent appeal against that judgment was dismissed in limine  on October 24, 1958.  It is against that order  that the  appeal has been brought on the certificate of the  High Court under Art. 133(1)(c). A  person  who  appears in obedience to  the  process  of  a foreign  Court  and  applies for leave to  defend  the  suit without  objecting to the jurisdiction of the Court when  he is  not  compellable by law to do so must be  held  to  have voluntarily  submitted to jurisdiction of such Court  Shaikh Atham Sahib v. Davud Sahib(1).  Therefore it cannot be  said that  this decree suffered from the defects which a  foreign ex-parte  decree without such submission would suffer  from. The  order for transfer was made at a time when  the  Indian Code  of Civil Procedure became applicable to the  whole  of India  including the former territories of Hyderabad  State. The order of transfer was therefore valid and effective  and the decree could therefore be executed. The  appeal,  in  our  opinion,  is  without  merit  and  is therefore dismissed with costs.

" 336 ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition NO. 844 OF 1991. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India) WITH S.L.P.NOS. 16475 & 17635 of 1991. N.S.   Hegde,  Amrendra  Bal  and  J.R.  Das   for   the Petitioners. Soresh  Roy,  Ms. Kirti Mishra and P.N. Mishra  for  the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA, CJ. We have already dismissed the writ  petition and special leave petitions by our order dated 5.12.1991. We would, however, like to make a suggestion to the authorities for their consideration that some preference might be  given to  in-service candidates who have done five years of  rural service.   In  the  first place, it  is  possible  that  the facilities for keeping up with the latest medical literature might not be available to such in-service candidates and the nature of their work makes it difficult for them to  acquire knowledge  about  very  recent medical  research  which  the candidates  who  have  come  after  freshly  passing   their graduation  examination might have.  Moreover, it might  act as an incentive to doctors who had done their graduation  to do  rural service for some time.  Keeping in mind  the  fact that  the  rural  areas had  suffered  grievously  for  non- availability  of  qualified doctors  giving  such  incentive would   be  quite  in  order.   Learned  counsel   for   the respondents  has,  however,  drawn  out  attention  to   the decision  of a Division Bench of two learned judges of  this Court  in Dr. Dinesh Kumar & Ors. v. Motilal  Nehru  Medical College, Allahabad & Ors., [1986] 3 SCC page 727 at 740.  It has been observed there that merely by offering a  weightage of  15  per cent to a doctor for three years  rural  service would not bring about a migration of doctors from the  urban to  rural areas.  They observed that it you want to  produce doctors  who  are MD or MS, particularly surgeons,  who  are going  to  operate  upon  human  beings,  it  is  of  utmost importance  that  the selection should be  based  on  merit. Learned  Judges  have gone on to observe that  no  weightage should be given to a candidate for rural service rendered by him  so  far  as admissions  to  post-graduate  courses  are concerned (see para 12 at pate 741). In  our  opinion, this observation certainly  does  not constitute the ratio of the decision.  The decision is in no way dependent upon these 337 observations.    Moreover,   those   observations   are   in connection  with All India Selection and do not  have  equal force when applied to selection from a single State.   These observations,  however,  suggest that the  weightage  to  be given  must  be  the  bare  minimum  required  to  meet  the situation.  In these circumstances, we are of the view  that the authorities might well consider giving weightage upto  a maximum  of  5  per cent of marks in  favour  of  in-service candidates  who  have done rural service for five  years  or more.  The actual percentage would certainly have to be left to the authorities.  We also clarify that these  suggestions do  not  in  any way confer any legal  right  on  in-service students who have done rural service nor do the  suggestions have  any application to the selection of the students  upto the end of this year.

Thus, appeal by special leave. It is now well settled legal position in law that under the Requisitioning  and Acquisition  of  Immovable  Property Act, there  is no  provision to  pay enhanced  solatium  and interest; and  Amendment Act,  I.e.

The District Court has no  jurisdiction to  amend  the  award  and    to  grant Sections 151 and 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is a case of  inherent lack  of  jurisdiction.  The  High  Court, therefore, has  committed manifest  error of jurisdiction in not removing the error committed by the Tribunal.

" O R D E R We have heard learned counsel on both sides. Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the High  Court of  Kerala at  Ernakulam made on October 27, 1992 in  CRP No.1399/87.  The admitted  facts  are  that  K. Moideenkutty, the  declarant under  the Kerala  Land Reforms Act, 1961  was found to be in possession of 3171.53 acres of excess land in Thiruvampadi village. This finding came to be recorded by  the Taluk  Land Board,  Kozhlkode in  its order dated March  29, 1985  under the  Act .  That  order  became final. Subsequently,  the  Taluk  Land  Board  reopened  the matter and  by order dated August 5, 1986 found that the 877 tenants were  in occupation of an extent of 1726.90 acres of land  and   that  1444.63   acres  was   a  private   forest Consequently, K. Modieenkutty was not in excess of the land. That order dated August 8, 1986 came to be challenged in the revision. The  learned single  Judge dismissed  the revision upholding the  order of the second order passed by the Taluk Land Board. Thus, this appeal by special leave. We think  that the  view of  the High  Court is  wholly illegal and cannot be sustained. From the order of the Taluk Land Board  it is  not clear  as to what extent of the lands was in possession of each tenant and whether it was prior to the Act  came into  force or  was any  purchase  certificate given to  them etc.  All the  details were kept delightfully vague by the Taluk Land Board. The High Court had not looked at this aspect of the matter and chose to confirm the order. Further 1444.63  acres of said land were found to be private forest with  the finding that the settlement officer had not taken possession  of the  land. This  finding also is wholly illegal. It  was open  to the  declarant  K.Moideenkutty  to challenge the  original order passed by the Taluk Land Board on March  29, 1985  declaring that  he was  in excess of the land; but  he did  not challenge the order. Was it right for http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Taluk  Land Board  to go  behind that  order and declare that the  declarant was  not in  excess of  the land for the reason that possession of the land admeasuring 1444.63 acres was not  taken and  so it  is of  private forest. Failure to take possession  of excess land is one facet and declaration of the  said land  as private  forest is another. Failure to take possession  of the  land does  not ipso facto establish that the  lands are private forest lands. It was open to the owner to  challenge it  but was not done. Unfortunately, the High Court  also had  not gone into this aspect nor examined that aspect  from the  purview of  the Land Reforms Act. The orders of  the High  Court and  the Taluk Land Board are set aside. The  matter is  remitted to  the High  Court  to  the extent of  land covered by the land said to be in possession of 877  tenants, The  High Court  is requested  to call upon Taluk Land  Board to  issue  notice  to  all  the  so-called tenants  and  the  appellant  and  after  giving  reasonable opportunity to  them determine as to who are said tenants in possession of the land and to what extent and when they came into possession  etc.  The  Taluk  Land  Board  should  give opportunity to  the appellant  to rebut the evidence adduced by the  so-called tenants and transmit the recorded facts to High Court.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned Single  Judge of  the Himachal  Pradesh High Court, dated  June 16,  1980 in  RSA No.  138/79. The  trial Court had  decreed the  suit and appellate court allowed the appeal and  dismissed the  suit. In  the second  appeal, the High Court reversed the judgment and decree of the appellate Court and confirmed that of trial Court. Thus, this appeal. The admitted  facts are  that the  suit  properties  of various Khasra  nos, admeasuring 12.4 bighas and 22.4 bighas situated in  Mohal Kanyarka  Pargana Churah Tehsil Bhattiyat District Chamba  in the  State of Himachal Pradesh, belonged to the  respondent. She  had filed  a  suit  for  possession against the appellant pleading that the he is a licensee and had agreed  to cultivate the lands or her behalf as licensee and, therefore,  he is  liable to  be ejected by a decree of eviction in  the suit.  It is the case of the appellant that though the  parties are  related, he is only a tenant giving the produce  to the  respondent-landlady for  her as  he was looking after her. The admitted position is that the Revenue records for the appellant had been shown as ’Gar Marusi’. It would appear  that it  means ""tenant at will"" Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act defined lease thus: ""A lease of immovable property  is a  transfer of  a right to enjoy such property made  for  a  certain  time,  express  or  paid  or promised, or  of money,  a shore  of crops,  service or  any other thing  of value,  to be  rendered periodically  or  on specified occassions  to the  transferor by  the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms"". It is not necessary that lease  should always  be reduced  to writing.  What  is necessary is  transfer  of  a  right  of  enjoyment  of  the property made for certain time, expressed or implied and for consideration of the price, paid or promised, the transferee must have been put in possession of the demised property. It is also  necessary that an agreement can be entered into for rendering periodical  service and  for consideration thereof and on transfer of the land to the transferee and acceptance thereof, either  orally or  in writing, the lease comes into existence. It  is seen  that when  the name of the appellant has successively  founded place  in the   records for period http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 from 1951-52  to 1971-72  as ""tenant at will"", the necessary conclusion is  that he  is tenant at will liable to eviction according to  law. The  theory that he is a licensee, as has been accepted  by the  High Court  and the  trial Court,  is untenable. A  licensee has  no right in the property, not to speak of  any right  to  the  exclusive  possession  of  the property and  animus of  possession always  remains with the licensor; the  licensee gets  the possession  only with  the consent of  the licensee  and is  liable to  vacate when  so asked.  In  this  case,  since  the  appellant  remained  in uninterrupted possession  and  enjoyment of the property for over 20  years, it  is unthinkable to conclude that they are only  licensee.   The  High   Court  and  the  trial  Court, therefore, were  clearly in error in reaching the conclusion that the  appellant is  only a  licensee. On the other hand, from the  facts, it is  clear that the appellant is a tenant and he  will be liable for ejectment only in accordance with law. If  he is  otherwise entitled  to tenancy  right of the property, the right can be had in accordance with law and it is open him to work out the same in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed in the light of the above facts and circumstances. No costs.","The High Court reversed the judgment and decree of the appellate Court and confirmed that of trial Court.

" JUDGMENT Nanavati. J. The respondent has been convicted under Section  304 Part I IPC and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven  years.  The  State  has  filed  this appeal as he was acquitted under Section 302 IPC. The High Court  has  recorded  a  finding  that  the incident  took  place  at the spur of a moment. There was no motive for committing the offence. The respondent had  given only one blow in the sudden quarrel which took place between him and the deceased. After   taking   into    consideration    all    the circumstances,  the  High  Court convicted him under Section 304 Part I IPC.  Considering the facts and circumstances  of the case, it cannot be said that the High Court was wrong in acquitting him under Section 302 IPC and convicting him only under section 304 Part I IPC.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel for both the parties. This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Special Appeal No.292/92 dated April 26, 1994. The undisputed facts are that respondent was appointed for a period of three months or till the regularly selected candidate assumes office. He was appointed on January 28, 1988 and his appointment came to be terminated on November 19, 1988. When the writ petition was filed, the learned single Judge held that since he had completed more than 240 days, the termination is in violative of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, ‘the Act’) and directed to make fresh appointment of the respondent. When appeal was filed against the latter part of the order, the Division Bench set aside the latter part of the order and directed reinstatement with back wages. As against the order altered by the Division Bench, the present appeal came to be filed. The controversy now stands concluded by a judgement of this Court reported in M. Venugopal vs. Divisional Manager,LIC., [(1994) 2 SCC 323]. Therein this Court had held that once an appointment is for a fixed period. Section 25F does not apply as it is covered by clause (bb) of Section 2 (oo) of the Act. It is contended for the respondent that since the order of the learned single Judge was not challenged, the termination became final. Consequently, the appellant would be liable to pay back wages on reinstatement. In our considered view, the opinion expressed by learned single Judge as well Division Bench are incorrect in law. When the appointment is for a fixed period, unless there is finding that power under clause (bb) of Section 2 (oo) was misused or vitiated by its mala fide exercise, it cannot be held that the termination is illegal. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In its absence, the employer could terminate the services in terms of the letter of appointment unless it is a colourable exercise of power. Unfortunately, neither the learned single Judge nor the Division Bench recorded any finding in this behalf. Therefore, where the termination is in terms of letter of appointment saved by clause (bb), neither reinstatement or fresh appointment could be made. Since the appellant has not filed any appeal against the order of the learned single Judge and respondent came to be appointed afresh on June 27, 1992, he would continue in service, till the regular incumbent assumes office as originally ordered. The question then is whether the respondent is entitled to payment of back wages. Since the order is found to be in terms of letter of appointment, respondent is not entitled to back wages. The Division Bench was incorrect in directing payment of back wages. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicates above. No costs.","This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Special Appeal No.292/92 dated April 26, 1994.

These appeals by special leave  are directed  against  the judgment of the  Gujarat  High  Court dated  4.8.1972 quashing the declaration under s. 6  of  the Land Acquisition Act, Act 1 of 1894, on the ground that  the same  made on 18th of January, 1969, was issued beyond  rea- sonable time. The short facts are: The preliminary notification  under s. 4(1) of the Act was made on 26.7.1963. On 16/18,  1,J969, the declaration under s. 6 was duly notified. On 17.1.1972 a writ  petition was filed in the High Court  challenging  the declaration. The High Court took notice of the Land Acquisi- tion (Amendment & Validation) Act of 1967 but relying upon a Division  Bench  judgment of the same High  Court  in  Valji Mulji  v.  State, 11 GLR 95 held that the  period  of  5-1/2 years  from  the date of the  preliminary  notification  was unreasonable delay for making of the declaration under s.  6 of the Act. The  validation provision came into force on 20th  Janu- ary,  1967.  Two judgments of this Court dealing  with  this aspect  being Gujarat State Transport Corporation  v.  Valji Mulji Soneji & Ors., [1979] 3 SCC 202 and State of Gujarat & Anr. v. Punjabai Nathubhai & Ors., [1986] 2 SCC 478 have now concluded  the position with reference to the provisions  of the  Validation Act and on the ratio of these judgments  the decision  of  the Gujarat High Court on which  reliance  was placed  by  the  High Court in disposing  of  these  matters cannot  be sustained. We accordingly allow the appeals,  set aside the decision of the High Court and sustain the  decla- ration  under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act  dated  18.1. 1969.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated July 28, 1993 made in Writ Appeal No.752/92. The Director of Settlement by  his order  dated October  25, 1990  suo  motu exercised power  under Section  5(2) of  the Andhra  Pradesh (Andhra Area) Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari Act (26  of 1948)  (for short,  the ’Act’) and set aside the order of  the Settlement  Officer  dated  February  7,  1983 granting ryotwari  patta under  Section 11(a)  of the Act to the respondent.  When that  order was  challenged by  way of writ petition,  the learned single Judge set aside the order holding that  the exercise  of the power after long lapse of time was  arbitrary; there  was no material produced to show circumstances under which the power came to be exercised and that, under those circumstances, the order setting aside the grant of ryotwari patta is illegal. It is  seen that Section 5(2) of the Act gives power as under: ""Every Settlement  Officer shall be subordinate  to  the  Director  and shall  be  guided  by  such  lawful instructions as  he may  issue from time  to  time;  and  the  Director shall also  have power to cancel or revise any  of the  orders, acts or proceedings   of   the   Settlement Officer other than those in respect of which  an  appeal  lies  to  the Tribunal."" It is  settled law  that the power of suo motu revision can be  exercised within  reasonable time.  When it  is held that the  power may  be exercised  from time  to time,  what would be  the reasonable  time depends  upon facts  of  each case. It is seen that in this case the orders were issued by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Settlement Officer contrary to the provisions and it was not known  till an  enquiry was  held and  until it  came to light that  the exercise  of power by the Settlement Officer under Section 11 (a) of the Act was clearly in contravention of the provisions of the Act. Under those circumstances, the Director was  constrained to  exercise the power. It is also seen that  when the  record was  called for it came to light that the  record was destroyed. It would be obvious that the persons behind  the scheme  had  managed  to  see  that  the records were destroyed. Considered from this perspective, we are of  the view that the High Court was clearly in error in interfering with the order of the Director of Settlement. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  orders af the single Judge  and the  Division Bench are set aside and that of the Director of Settlement stands restored. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated July 28, 1993 made in Writ Appeal No.752/92.

" JUDGMENT 2002 (3) SCR 224 The following Order of the Court was delivered The Tribunal was concerned with whether making trusses, columns and purlines amounted to manufacture. The Tribunal followed an earlier decision in the case of Aruna Industries, Vishakhapatnam v. C.C.E., Guntur (1986) 25 ELT 580. It did not follow another decision in the case of Structurals and Machineries (Bokaro) Pvt. Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise. (1984) 17 ELT 127. It is submitted on behalf of the Revenue that there are conflicting views taken by the Tribunal and that such conflicting views have been taken even after the impugned order. In one of these subsequent judgments, in the case of Richardson and Cruddas (1972) Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, [1988] 38 ELT 176, the case of Aruna Industries (supra) has been considered and found to be applicable to a situations where the assessee was erecting the structures at the constructions site and fabricating materials on the spot; it was therefore found that this could not be considered to be fabrication in a factory. Now, in the instant case, the Tribunal noted that it had been found as a fact by the Collector that the assessee had undertaken fabrication work at site. This was a case, therefore, to which the decision of Aruna Industries (supra) applied and the Tribunal’s order cannot be faulted. The appeal is dismissed.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition has been filed against the order of  the  High  Court  of  Punjab  &  Haryana  made  on 29.5.1996 in C.M.No.933/96 in LPA No.60/96. Admittedly, the petitioner had claimed reimbursement of medical  expenses   spent  in  private  hospital  for  heart disease. Ultimately,  the amount  came to  be  disbursed  on August 28,  1991 but there was delay in Payment thereof. The petitioner filed  the writ  petition. The  High Court in LPA directed payment  of the  amount but  disallowed interest at 12% as claimed by the petitioner. He filed a review petition and the  same came  to be dismissed. Thus this special leave petition. It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the petitioner that  in several  cases, the  Division Bench  had directed payment  of interest,  but in  this case, they have departed from  the above  principle. When  a  special  leave petition was  filed by  the State,  this Court had dismissed the same in limine. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to the payment of interest. We do  not find any force in the contention. lt is true that but  for the  benefit of  reimbursement of  the  amount granted by  the Government,  the petitioner  has no right to claim reimbursement.  The question is: Whether on account of delay in  reimbursing the  amount incurred  towards  medical expenses, the State should be liable to pay also interest on the  delayed  payment?  We  are  of  the  view  that  it  is inexpedient and  not proper  to  direct  the  State  to  pay interest for  delay in  payment of the reimbursement amount. lt  requires  verification  of  the  amounts  spent  by  the petitioner and  similar person.  His right  only is  to  get reimbursement and  it does  not follow that for the delay in the payment  of medical  reimbursement, he  should  also  be entitled to interest thereon. The order passed by this Court on an  earlier occasion  was to the effect of dismissing the special leave  petition In  limine. Therefore  it  does  not furnish  any   for   following   the   same.   Under   these circumstances, we  do not  think that  it would be proper to direct payment  of interest  on the delayed reimbursement of the medical expenses incurred by a Government servant. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.",Petitioner claimed reimbursement of medical expenses   spent in private hospital for heart disease.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Though the  respondents  have  been  served  twice  and respondents 1,  2 and  6 were  again served on September 22, 1995, they  are not  appearing either  in person  or through counsel. Acknowledgments from respondents 3, 4 and 5 for the second occasion  have  not  been  received.  We,  therefore, declare that they are deemed to have been served. The only  question is: whether the respondents are entitled to  the  proportionate  reduction  of  the  minimum guaranteed amount  for non-supply  of the electricity due to disruption by  trippings load sheddings and power cuts etc.? Clause [13] of the contract entered into, provides that they are entitled  to make an application in such a situation and the Board would consider and pass appropriate orders in that behalf. Admittedly,  the respondents  had not  made such  an application, but  straightway approached  the High Court for the relief.  The High  Court in  the  impugned  order  dated August, 16,  1988 in  C.W.J.C. No. 1480 of 1988 directed the appellant  to   grant  them   proportionate  reduction.  The controversy is  no longer  res integra.  This Court in Bihar State Electricity  Board & Anr. vs. M/s. Dhanawat Rice & Oil Mills, [(1989)  1 SCC  452] arising from the appellant-Board itself had held that under Section 49, an agreement had been entered into  by the  consumer with  the  appellant  to  pay minimum guarantee  of charges  to the  Board. On  failure to consume the  minimum guaranteed  level of electricity due to non-supply of  electricity by  trippings, load  sheddings or power cuts,  the consumer  would  be  entitled  to  make  an application  for  proportionate  reduction  of  the  minimum guarantee.  Since   respondents  had   not  made   such   an application,  the   High  Court   was   not   justified   in straightaway allowing  the writ  petitions and directing the grant of  the proportionate  reduction.  The  order  is  set aside.

Heard Mr.T.L.V.Iyer, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Gp.Capt.Karn Singh Bhatti, learned counsel for the respondents. We have perused the order impugned in this appeal. According to the appellant, he is retired from service on 30.11.2005. He is facing a departmental inquiry and the same is pending for a very long time without being finally disposed of.  He has also challenged the charges framed against him and the said case is also pending before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderbad.  Before the High Court, he also made a prayer for expeditious disposal of the matter pending before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The High Court directed the Central Administrative Tribunal to consider the request made by the appellant and dispose of the matter at an early date.  Thereafter, an application was filed before the Tribunal to expedite hearing which was disposed of on 20.03.2006 stating that there were large number of matters pending prior to the OA filed by the appellant and, at that stage, it was not inclined to grant early hearing in the matter and that the applicant may renew his request for early hearing after three months.  This order was passed by the Tribunal on 20.03.2006. The reasoning given by the Tribunal for not taking up the matter at an early date is not acceptable to us.  The appellant has already superannuated on 30.11.2005. We, therefore, direct the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad to take up OA No.788/2005 on priority basis and dispose of the same within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this Order from this Court. The High Court also while disposing of the Writ Petition directed the respondent herein to pay the pension during the pendency of inquiry.  It is stated by the learned counsel for the appellant that the said direction has not been complied with.  We, therefore, direct the respondent to immediately arrange to pay the entire arrears of pension after retirement and continue to pay the same. Learned counsel for the appellant states that even though a request has already been made to travel abroad, i.e., to U.S.A. to see the members of his family but the same was not accepted during the pendency of the proceedings.  If the matter is not disposed of within two months as directed by us now, the appellant may also make an application to the Tribunal seeking permission to travel abroad and if such an application is filed, the same          shall be disposed of on merits and in accordance with law.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted.  Heard both counsel. 2.   The  tribunal  has  erred in law in  holding  that  the respondent   employee  ought  to  have  been  heard   before transfer.   No law requires an employee to be  heard  before his transfer when the authorities make the transfer for  the exigencies of administration.  However, the learned  counsel for the respondent, contended that in view of the fact  that respondent’s  children are studying in school, the  transfer should  not  have been effected  during  mid-academic  term. Although  there is no such rule, we are of the view that  in effecting  transfer,  the  fact  that  the  children  of  an employee  are  studying should be given due weight,  if  the exigencies  of  the  service are not  urgent.   The  learned counsel appearing for the appellant was unable to point  out that  there  was such urgency in the present case  that  the employee  could not have been accommodated till the  end  of the  current  academic year.  We, therefore,  while  setting aside  the impugned order of the Tribunal, direct  that  the appellant should not effect the transfer till the end of the current  academic year.

The suit for specific performance of agreement dated  January 29,  1986 for  the sale of 4840 sq. ft.of land  in Madras  city, laid  by  the  respondent,  was decreted ex-parte.  The appellants  had filed an application to set  aside the ex-parte decree which was dismissed by the trial Court  and confirmed  by the  High Court  in revision. Thus, this appeal by special leave. A reading of the facts leaves us with no doubt that the advocate has  derelicted his  duty to  inform the  client by registered post  if there  was any non-cooperation on behalf of the  appellants. Consequently,  when the suit had come up for trial,  he has  withdrawn his vakalatnama without notice to the  respondents. The  trial  Court  set  the  appellants exparte and  decreed the  suit for specific performance. The application for  condonation of  delay of 40 days was filed. The Court  refused to  condone the  delay. In  view  of  the above, we  find that  she is  well justified  in filing  the application with  the  delay.  The  delay  is    accordingly condoned. The ex-parte decree is set  aside. The trial Court is directed  to give opportunity to the appellants to cross- examine the  witness examined by the respondents of the suit and also  adduce evidence  on her behalf.

The High Court confirmed the conviction  of Ganga  Singh but acquitted Anmol sing and Rup Narain., It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant  that   the  courts  below,  having  accepted  the evidence of  PW-10, as  regards  the  assault  made  on  his father, Chedi Singh, ought to have convicted Asharfi Ram and Rup Narain  also along with Ganga Singh as all the three had assaulted his  father together  and caused  his death.   The High Court considered the evidence of PW-10 and held that he has not truly stated the manner in which Amrit Singh and his father were  assaulted.   The High  Court also held that his evidence was  not consistent  with the  medical evidence  on record.   We, therefore,  agree with the finding recorded by the High  Court that  Ganga Singh  had  taken  part  in  the assault  on   Chedi  Singh  but  it  is  not  proved  beyond reasonable doubt  that Asharfi  Ram and  Rup Narain also had assaulted his father and Amrit Singh. As rightly  conceded by  the learned  counsel  for  the appellant and  the State,  Anmol Singh,  PW-10, is  the only eye-witness in  this case.   We find that in the FIR, he had named only  three persons  as the assailants, even though he had also stated that there was a mob of about 50-60 persons. His version  in the FIR was different from the version given by him  in the  court.   Even though, in the FIR, he did not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 name the  assailants of  Amrit Singh and Janardhan, he named them specifically  while giving  his evidence.   Thus,  this only eye-witness  had  made  material  improvements  in  his evidence.   If, for  this reason,  his evidence has not been believed by  the High Court, it cannot be said that the High Court has  not correctly appreciated his evidence.  As we do not find  any infirmity  in the  appreciation of evidence or the  reasons   given  by  the  High  Court,  the  appeal  is dismissed. The Bail Bonds are cancelled.","Anmol Singh, the original informant, filed an appeal against acquittal of the respondents, Asharfi  Ram and Rup Narain.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Heard learned counsel for the parties. 2.      It appears that vide an interim order dated 12.1.2001, the High Court granted ad interim injunction and a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court refused to interfere. 3.      A brief reference to the factual aspects would suffice: 4.      The respondent filed a suit claiming that she is a film actress of good standing. Certain articles were published in the magazine published by the appellants called \021Stardust\022.  A suit for damages of Rs.20 crores alleging that the articles are defamatory in nature and would affect her career and for injunction restraining the appellants from publishing defamatory articles was filed. Notice of motion for interim injunction was taken out. Learned Single Judge was of the prima facie view that the articles deal with the personal life and are defamatory in nature and granted interim injunction. The interim injunction reads as follows: ""Therefore, as directed in the case of Indian Express Newspapers (supra), a modified injunction is hereby granted restraining the defendants from republishing the three articles and/or from writing and publishing any defamatory article in the nature of the three articles alleging that the plaintiff is having relationship with other actors or a married man, which will operate till the disposal of the suit.\024 5.      The said order dated 12.01.2001, as noted above, was challenged in appeal. 6.      Before the Division Bench, the stand was that the interim injunction granted was beyond the prayer made in the notice of motion. The High Court noted that in notice of motion, the prayer was in the following terms: ""That pending the hearing and final disposal of the suit, this Hon’ble Court be pleased to issue an order and injunction restraining the defendants from in any way or http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 manner carrying our defamatory, allegations and imputations in future against the plaintiff"". 7.      The Division Bench was of the further view that the Learned Single Judge had not granted interim protection beyond what was prayed and was covered by the prayer. 8.      The other stand before the Division Bench was that moment justification is pleaded, there can be no interim protection. This plea was also rejected stating that a person cannot be defamed by allowing such publications in future. Justification shall be required to be established at the time of hearing of the suit by leading evidence. 9.      There were certain other stands relating to lack of pleadings about the reputation and character. The Division Bench found that also to be without substance. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. 10.     Learned counsel for the appellant reiterated the stand taken before the Division Bench. Mr. Bhattacharye, learned counsel for the respondent supported the order. 11.     We find that the matter relates to an interim order and while granting leave, the prayer for grant of interim relief was refused. In other words, interim order passed by learned Single Judge as upheld by the Division Bench continues to be operative. Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, we think it proper to dispose of the appeal without interference.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (ARISING OUT OF SLP (CRIMINAL) NO.4672 OF 2007) Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court was not right in cancelling the bail in a Miscellaneous Criminal Case filed by some other accused persons particularly so when the State has neither moved an application for cancellation of the bail of the accused-appellants before the Sessions Court nor has preferred revision before the High Court for cancellation of the same.  This Court has held in Raghubir Singh and Others vs. State of Bihar, (1986) 4 SCC 481 that bail can be cancelled where the accused (i) misuses his liberty by indulging in similar criminal activity, (ii) interferes with the course of investigation, (iii) attempts to tamper with evidence or witnesses, (iv) threatens witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would hamper smooth investigation, (v) there is likelihood of his fleeing to another country, (vi) attempts to make himself scarce by going underground or becoming unavailable to the investigation agency, (vii) attempts to place himself beyond the reach of the sureties, etc. For the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court whereby the bail of the accused-appellants has been cancelled. The accused- appellants shall be released on bail  on their furnishing personal bonds in the sum of Rs.25,000/- each with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Sessions Court.

" O R D E R This appeal  arises from  the order  of the Bombay High Court made on September 1, 1979 in Special Civil Application No.3045 of 1973. The only  question  in  this  appeal  is:  whether  the appellants are entitled to two more units under Section 6 of the Maharashtra Agricultural Land [Ceiling of Holdings] Act, 1961 [for short, the ’Act’]? In the High Court it was stated that the Tribunal ought to have condoned the delay in filing the review petition and the failure  to condone  the delay  was an error apparent on the face  of record.  The High Court did not agree with that contention. On merits, no challenge was made to the order of the  Tribunal   before  the  High  Court.  Mr.  K.  Rajendra Chowdhary, learned counsel for the appellants contended that in his return filed under Section 12 of the Act on April 25, 1962, in  the verification  he had mentioned that apart from himself  he   had  three   sons  and   three  daughters.  In computation of the ceiling area, a family of five members is entitled to  one unit  and if  two more  members are  in the family, each  is entitled to one unit separately. If that is considered, the  finding of  the Tribunal is not correct and that the  appellants are not in excess of 30.4 acres of land but within  the ceiling limit. Therefore, the High Court was not right  in dismissing  the  matter.  In  support  of  the contention that the appellants had three daughters, he seeks to place on record the school certificates said to have been issued by the Head-master concerned. The only  question is:  whether the High Court is right in its  above-stated conclusion.  The counsel  appearing for the appellants  did not  press anything on merits. He merely argued that  the refusal  to condone the delay in filing the review petition constitutes an error of law. It is seen that the condonation  of delay  is discretion  of the Tribunal or the Court, as the case may be. Whether to grant or to refuse http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 condonation of delay being within the discretionary power of the Court and the Tribunal, we find no compelling reasons to disagree with the findings and the conclusion reached by the authorities. The  question whether  the first  appellant has two members  as three daughters are said to be there, it was open  to   him  to   press  before   the   authorities   but unfortunately he  did not  raise any plea neither before any of the authorities or before the High Court. In these  circumstances, it would be very difficult for this Court  to rely upon the certificates produced before us without any  investigation  or  a  finding  thereon  by  any authority under  the Act  and to  act upon  the same at this distance of  time. We  find no  merit in  this  appeal.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","This appeal  arises from the order  of the Bombay High Court made on September 1, 1979 in Special Civil Application No.3045 of 1973.

Aggrieved against the direction to deposit 50% of the enhanced amount along with the proportionate amounts towards solatium, additional market value and the interest thereon, the appellant through its General Manager preferred the above Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No.2471/2007. We have perused the grounds of appeal and also heard the arguments advanced by learned ASG for the appellant and learned counsel for the respondents.  Since the appeal is pending before the High Court, we are not expressing any opinion on the merits of the rival claims.  However, in our opinion, the order of the High Court ordering deposit of 50% of the enhanced amount  with liberty to withdraw needs modification.

" O R D E R Though notice  was sent to the legal representatives of the contesting  respondents, the acknowledgment has not been received. Therefore, it must be deemed to have been served. The only  question for  consideration is:  whether  the respondent should  be appointed as a headman under Section 5 of the  Santal Parganas  Tenancy (Supplementary  Provisions) Act, 1949  (Bihar Act  14 of  1949) (for  short,  ‘Act’)  by virtue of  hereditary right  or by election? It is seen that the village  headman, by  name Hari Hembrom, had resigned in 1950 as  a headman  and, thereafter,  no appointment  of the headman was  made. In  the meanwhile, the village has become khas village within the meaning of Section 1(ix) of the Act. Resultantly, when  an application was made by the Raiyats of the village,  the Assistant  Commissioner  had  directed  to conduct the election in which the appellant was declared the successful candidate.  When the  respondent  challenged  the election before  the authority,  a remand  order was passed. The appellant  filed a revision before the Commissioner. The Commissioner accepting  the contentions of the appellant set aside the order of appointment. When writ petition was filed against that order, the High Count by the impugned order had held that  appointment should  be made  as far  as  possible under the hereditary principle. In case the candidate in the line of  succession on  hereditary principle is unavailable, them  the  election  requires  to  be  done.  The  question, therefore, is  : whether the view taken by the High Court is correct in  law? Section  4(ix) defines ""Khas village"", as a village in which there is no mulraiyat (headman) nor for the time being any village headman irrespective of whether there was not  previously a  mulraiyat or  village headman  in the village. Section  5 provides  that on  an application  of  a raiyat or  of landlord  of any  Khas village  and  with  the consent of  at least  two-thirds of the jamabandi raiyats of the village ascertained in the manner prescribed, the Deputy Commissioner may declare that headman shall be appointed for the village  and shall  then proceed to make the appointment in the prescribed manner. The question  then is:  whether a person from different village can  contest the  election for  headman? It  is seen http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that a  reading of  the provisions  does not indicate that a stranger to  the village  is intended  to be  elected  as  a headman. In  this case,  the appellant  is  right  that  the principle of  hereditary succession does not arise. It would arise only  with the  incumbant dies  and his  successor  is available; in such a situation, under the scheme of the Act, the headmanship  is required to be given to his son. In this case, since  Hari Hembrom  had already resigned voluntarily, the  question  of  hereditary  succession  does  not  arise. Admittedly, the  appellant is  not from  the  same  village. Therefore, he  cannot claim  the right  of appointment.  The Commissioner, therefore,  is  directed  to  hold  a  regular election in  accordance with  prescribed procedure  and read with Section 5 of the Act. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.","The village headman, by  name Hari Hembrom, had resigned in 1950 as a headman. The village has become khas village within the meaning of Section 1(ix) of the Act.

" JUDGMENT O  R  D  E  R [ Arising out of SLP {C} No.11875 of 2005 ] 1.      Delay condoned. 2.      Leave granted. 3.      This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 2nd of November, 2004 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in C.W.J.C. No.9602 of 2004. 4.      At the relevant point of time, the appellant was working as an officiating Vice Principal in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan [ for short ’the Sangathan’ ].  After retirement, he made representations before the authorities for consideration of his prayer for promotion to the post of Principal in the Sangathan.  An approach was made before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna, [ for short ’the Tribunal ] for a direction to the authorities to consider the said prayer of the appellant. By an order, the Tribunal directed the authorities to consider his prayer for promotion to the said post of Principal.  The representation filed by the appellant was considered and rejected by the authorities against which, the Tribunal was approached again which rejected the prayer of the appellant. Feeling aggrieved, a writ petition was moved before the High Court which also affirmed the order of the Tribunal.  The present appeal by grant of special has been preferred against the aforesaid order of the High Court. 5.      Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and after going through the materials on record, including the order passed by the Tribunal and the impugned order dismissing the writ petition, we do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court in the exercise of our power under Article 136 of the Constitution.  It is not in dispute that while the appellant was in service, he did not raise any objection for not selecting him for promotion to the post of Principal in the Sangathan.  Challenge was made by the appellant only after his retirement.  The Tribunal, while rejecting his prayer for promotion to the post of Principal in the Sangathan, on consideration of the material on record, held that no irregularity or illegality was committed by the Selection Committee while considering his prayer for promotion as Principal in the Sangathan.  In the impugned order, the High Court concurred with the finding of the Tribunal that the appellant had failed to point out any violation of the statutory rules or Article 14 of the Constitution by denial of promotion to him.  The High Court also held that only because a different view could be taken, it was no ground to reconsider the matter as urged on behalf of the appellant.  We do not find any reason to interfere with these findings of the High Court or the Tribunal mainly on the ground that the Tribunal was approached by the appellant after his retirement from service and even while in service, the appellant had not challenged his supersession by other http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 junior members. 6.      Since the appellant had already retired and in view of the findings of the High Court, with which we are in full agreement, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court. The appeal, thus, fails.  There will be not order as to costs.","This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 2nd of November, 2004 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in C.W.J.C.

" O R D E R The controversy  involved in  this case  relates to the terms of  the offices  of  the    President  and  the  Vice- President of  the Board  of the  Committee.  It  is  not  in dispute that the election to the Baroda District Cooperative Milk Producers’  Union Ltd.  was held  on June  25, 1982 and thereafter proviso  to Section 74 of the Gujarat Cooperative Societies Act was amended on July 17, 1984 providing for the rules of  rotation  in  the  matter  of  retirement  of  the members. Subsequently,  the election  to the  Committee  was held on  May  16,  1994.  A  meeting  was  convened  by  the Collector for  election  of  the  President  and  the  Vice- President.  Calling   that  action  of  the  Collector,  the petitioner had filed a writ petition which was dismissed. On appeal, viz.,  L.P.A. No.473/97,  by judgment dated February 25, 1997, the Division Bench has confirmed the same. It is  contended for  the petitioner for the petitioner that under Section 74-C read with sub-section (2) of Section 145 of  the Gujarat  Cooperative Societies  Act, the term of the Committee is three years and, therefore, the term of the President and  the Vice-President  is co-terminus  with  the term of  the Committee.  As a consequence, the notice issued by the  Collector to  conduct the  meeting for  electing the President and  the Vice-President  is without  authority  of law. We find no force in the contention. It is  true that  under Section  74-C read with Section 145(2), the term of the elected Committee is three years but the bye-law 40.1 provides thus: ""The first  meeting of the Board of Directors after  the Annual General Meeting shall  be called within one month   of   the   Annual   General Meeting. All  the  members  of  the Board present  as its meeting shall elect  its   President  and   Vice- President  for  the  year  and  the President and  Vice-President shall hold  the   office  until   a   new President or  Vice-President as the case may be is/are elected."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A reading  of its  clearly  indicates  that  the  first meeting of  the Board of Directors, after the Annual General Meeting shall be called by the Collector within one month of the Annual  General Meeting.  Thereon all the members of the Board as  would be  present at  its meeting  shall elect its President and  Vice-President for the year and the President and  Vice-President  shall  hold  the  office  until  a  new President or  Vice-President  as  the  case  may  be  is/are elected. Thus it is clear that though the terms of the Committee is three years, the term of the President or Vice-President, as the  case may  be, elected  at meeting  of the  Board  of Directors,  shall  be  only  for  one  year  until  the  new President or  Vice-President, as the case may be, is elected again. The  collector has  been conferred  with the power to call the  meeting to  elect the  President/Vice President in accordance with  the bye-laws.  His action, therefore, is in accordance  with   law.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 7617-50 OF 1996 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos.27604-37 of 1995) O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. By order  dated December 4, 1995, this Court had issued notice and  directed interim  stay of  the execution  of the awards, subject  to the  condition that  the appellant would pay 50%  of the  enhanced compensation.  We are  informed by Shri Goswami, learned senior counsel for the appellant, that the order  has been  complied with. On the other hand, it is contended for  the respondents  that the  deposit 50% of the amount was  not in  terms of  the decree  of  the  reference Court. Be it as it may, the appellant is directed to deposit 50% of the enhanced compensation as awarded under Section 26 of the  Land Acquisition  Act, 1894  in the decree and award which is  the subject  matter of  the present  appeals.  The respondents are  at liberty  to withdraw  the  same  without furnishing any security. The withdrawal of 50% of the amount will be  subject to  the result  in the  appeal. In case the appeals are  allowed, to  that extent  the respondents shall restitute the amounts withdrawn. Pursuant to  the order passed by this Court on December 4, 1995, an enquiry was held into the allegation made by the respondents in their counter affidavit, in particular by one Mr. B.S.  Hans S/o Rattan Singh that one B.K. Mehta, dealing clerk  of   the  Defence   Estate  Office,   Gopinath  Bazar approached the Claimants and asked them to pay 2% commission promising that  the decretal  amount will  be deposited  one R.K. Sharma,  Director,  Defence  Estate,  Western  Command, Chandigarh came to be appointed as an Enquiry Office. In his report dated  December 26,  1995 in paragraph 28, he came to the conclusion  that there  is no  evidence in regard to the allegation made by the Hans and members of the Bar. On going through the  report submitted  by him,  we are  at a loss to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 understand his conclusion in the face of the material placed before him.  However, Mr. Goswami informed us that a regular enquiry has  been ordered  and it would be conducted in this matter. It  is needless  to say that the report submitted by R.K. Sharma  is not  even worthy  of salt to look at and was not stemmed  with a  sense of responsibility but with a zeal to shield  the corrupt  and the  reasons are not far to seek and  ex   facie  eloquent.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 1360-1363 OF 2001 This appeal preferred by the plaintiff is directed against the judgment and order dated 19.11.1999 passed by the High Court in Second Appeal Nos. 48, 49 and 61 of 1998. We have heard the parties. Plaintiff \026 appellant’s suit for permanent injunction in respect of land measurin g 4 acres out of 11 acres and 99 cents in Survey No. 254/2 of village Mevalurkuppam, Thandalam Firke of Sriperumbudur Taluk was decreed by the trial court.  The First Appeal filed by the defendant, respondent       herein, was dismissed by the appellate court.  Aggrieved thereby, the defendant filed the aforesaid Second Appeal before the High Court under Section 100 C.P.C.  The High Court reversed the concurrent finding after re-appreciating the finding of facts recorded by the two Courts below in the Second Appeal. By now it is a well settled principle of law that a Second Appeal, filed under Section 100 C.P.C., can only be considered purely on a substantial question of law. In the present case the High Court has framed the following alleged substantial questions of law:- 1.Whether the lower appellate court completely misconstrued Exs.A13 and A14 and failed to note that the particulars in columns 12 and 13 of Ex.A13 are wholly inconsistent and contradictory to the particulars in column 26? 2.Whether the courts below erred in their approach and appreciation by placing the burden of proof on the defendant? 3.Whether the lower appellate court having held that the civil court has jurisdiction to go into the question of title inspite of the issue of a patta, failed to ascertain the extent of Paimash Nos. 520/1 and 520/3 and also to ascertain how there has been an excess of extent of nearly 8 acres in S.No.254/2? Exhibit A13 and A14 are the Survey and Settlement Registers in which list of properties taken over by Inam Abolition Act, 1948 has been listed.  Apart from the properties listed, their identity was admitted by the defendant in his written statement vide paragraphs 4 and 5 thereof.  As regards question No.2, it is well settled that burden of proof loses relevance when both sides have led evidence. Question No. 3 framed by the High Court relates to questions of fact and, in Second Appeal the High Court cannot sit over the findings of fact of the Courts below by re-appreciation of evidence and by re- examining the findings of fact already recorded by the two Courts below. That the disputed land consists of 4 acres out of 11 acres and 99 cents has been admitted by the defendant in his written statement. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of his written statement, the defendant had clearly stated that his interest is in the suit property measuring 4 acres out of the total extent of land measuring 11 acres and 99 cents. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The so called substantial question of law framed by the High Court was answered by the High Court in paragraph 24 of its judgment.  This is what the High Court has stated in paragraph 24 of the judgment:- ""The courts below have failed to note that there is clear evidence to show the extent of Paimash Nos. 520/1 and 520/3.  the extent of Paimash No.520/1 is 0.140.0 kanis which is equivalent to 1.17 acres, while the extent of Paimash no. 520/3 is 2.0.0 kanis, equivalent to 2.65 acres.  Thus the total extent would come to about 3 acres 82 cents.  Adding the 4 acres, at best it may come to only about 8 acres."" A reading of the findings recorded in paragraph 24 of the judgment of the High Court in Second Appeal clearly shows that the High Court has re-appreciated the findings of fact already recorded by the two Court below which had recorded concurrent findings of fact. This is not permissible under Section 100 C.P.C. For the reasons aforestated, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside. The order of the trial court and the first appellate court is restored.  The suit of the plaintiff stands decreed. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.669 OF 2008 (arising out of SLP(C)No.3023/2006) Leave granted. Heard the parties. We propose to dispose of this appeal with this short order. The respondent was working as Headmistress in Kamla Nehru Kanya Vidyalaya, Nandurbar. She was dismissed from service by an order dated 25.05.2000 preceded by an inquiry.  Aggrieved thereby, the respondent approached the School Tribunal. It appears that in the proceedings before the Tribunal, the Tribunal directed the appellant to furnish  a copy of the inquiry report, the inquiry records and documents relied on during the inquiry. Despite the repeated requests the appellant failed to produce the required documents and, therefore, the Tribunal allowed the appeal and set aside the order of dismissal. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant approached the High Court by way of writ petition which met with the same fate.  The High Court noticed the reasons recorded by the Tribunal and dismissed the writ petition.  Hence this appeal by special leave. ...2/- : 2 : This Court on 13.09.2007 directed the parties to produce the report of the enquiry dated 08.05.2000, show-cause notice dated 19.05.2000 and the reply dated 23.05.2000. Pursuant to the aforesaid direction, it appears that the inquiry report and other documents have now been produced and are available on record.  In our view, since those documents which have been produced pursuant to our direction dated 13.09.2007 have neither been considered by the Tribunal or the High Court, it would secure the ends of justice if the orders of the Tribunal and the High Court are set aside and the matter is remitted to the School Tribunal for a fresh decision after examining the inquiry report and the documents that are now available pursuant to our direction.   Accordingly, the matter is remitted to the School Tribunal for a fresh decision in accordance with law after considering the documents now made available. As the matter is pending since 1997, the Tribunal is directed to dispose of the appeal afresh within three months from today. The appellant is directed to produce records of the inquiry in original in its entirety before the Tribunal. We clarify that we set aside the orders of the Tribunal and the High Court for the reason being that the documents now available were not considered by the two courts below and any observation made herein shall not be construed as expression of opinion on the merit of the case.

B. Datta, ASG. and Ms. S. Relan for the Petitioner. The following Order was delivered This  Special Leave Petition has been filed  beyond  the period  prescribed by the Rules for filing a  special  leave petition. The petitioner has flied an application for condo- nation of delay in filing the special leave petition.  There are  no grounds made out in the application for  condonation of delay and the only material set out in the application is the  list of dates as starting from the date of  receipt  of the certified copy of the judgment upto the dates of  filing of  the Special Leave Petition. It appears from the list  of dates that the certified copy was received by the  Collector of Central Excise on 22nd July, 1984 (wrongly http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 368 mentioned as 22nd July, 84) and it was after a period of two months, on 29th September, 1984 that the certified copy  was despatched by the Collector of Central Excise to the  Minis- try of Finance. The Ministry of Finance referred the Case to the  Central Agency Section on 15th October, 1984.  But  the Central Agency Section sent back the case to the Ministry of Finance with the remark that the same should be sent to  the Ministry  of Law. This process of realisation that the  case should have been referred to the Ministry of Law and not  to the  Ministry of Finance took about 24 days and  thereafter, again, some time was taken up at the subsequent stages.  The learned  Additional  Solicitor General gave his  opinion  on 18th  December, 1984 that the special leave petition  should be  filed.  But even thereafter, there was a delay  of  more than  a  month and a half and on 7th July, 1985,  a  special leave  petition was filed without offering  any  explanation for  this  delay  at three stages.  The  Learned  Additional Solicitor General requested us to give him an opportunity to file  a supplemental affidavit explaining the delay  at  the three stages. But we do not see why any further time  should be granted to the petitioners to file a supplemental affida- vit.  The application for condonation of delay was  made  on 7th  January, 1985 and we are now in November 1986  and  the petitioners  thus  had a period of about one year  and  nine months to rectify the defect by filing a supplemental  affi- davit  but the petitioners have failed to do so. We  do  not under the circumstances find any justification for condoning the  delay and the application is therefore rejected and  so is the Special Leave Petition.

" THE 25TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 1997 Present: Hon’ble Dr. Justice A.S.Anand Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.Srinivasan Prem Malhotra, Adv. for the appellants Ravindra Bana, Adv. for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R Delay condoned. In this  appeal which  is directed against the judgment and order  of the High Court, dated 25.3.1985, notice issued by this  Court was  limited to  the question of solatium and interest only. Notification under  Section 4  of the  Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter the Act) was issued on 7.10.1971.  The Land Acquisition Collector  made an  Award giving compensation of the acquired  land @  Rs. 200/-  per marla.   The respondent sought a  reference under  Section 18 of the Act against the award of  the Land  Acquisition Collector  and  the  learned District Judge,  Gurgaon, vide  an Award,  dated  10.10.1978 allowed compensation  @ Rs.  10/-  per  square  yard.    The respondent challenged the award of the District Judge in the High Court.  A learned Single Judge, vide judgment and order dated  28.1.1981   allowed  the   appeal  and  enhanced  the compensation from  Rs. 10/-  per square yard to Rs. 12/- per square yard.   The  respondent took  the matter  further  in appeal to  the Division  Bench.   The Division Bench further raised the  compensation to  Rs. 15/-  per square yard.  The Division Bench also held the respondent entitled to solatium @ 30%  on the  increase of  Rs. 3/- per square yard, besides interest @  9% per  annum for  one year  from  the  date  of possession of  the land  and @  5% per annum thereafter till the date  of payment.   The  Division Bench  pronounced  the judgment on March 25, 1985.  Hence, this Appeal. Mr. Prem  Malhotra, learned  counsel for the appellants submits  that   the  Award  of  solatium  @  30%  under  the provisions of  Section 23(1-A)  of the Act, as introduced by the Amending  Act,  could  not  have  been  granted  to  the respondent in  view of  the judgment  of this  Court in K.S. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Paripoornan vs.  State of  Kerala & Ors. (1994 (5) SCC 593). It is  also submitted that since the Award was made prior to 1982 and  even the  District Judge disposed of the reference under Section 18 of the Act prior to 1982, interest @ 9% and 15% was  not admissible to the respondent.  Reliance in that behalf is  placed on  K.S. Paripoornan  (II)  Vs.  State  of Kerala & Ors. (1995 (1) SCC 367). The submission  made by  Mr. Malhotra  is well founded. Both the  issues are  squarely  covered  by  the  judgments, noticed above, we, therefore, accept this appeal in part and set aside  the judgment  and order  of the High Court, dated 25.3.1985 and  hold that the respondents are not entitled to grant of any solatium and that the rate of interest shall be confined to  6% per  annum only.   With this modification in the judgment  and order  of the  High Court dated 25.3.1985, the appeal  is disposed  of.   There shall,  however, be  no order as to costs.","The appeal was directed against the judgment and order of the High Court, dated 25.3.1985.

" J U D G M E N T P.K. BALASUBRAMANYAN, J. 1.              The appellant was born a Maharashtrian Barhmin.  She married one Naresh Kumar Thakur who is a Namdev by caste.   In the election to the Municipal Corporation of Gwalior, the appellant filed her nomination for election for the post of a Corporator for Ward No.50, a ward reserved for backward communities.   The appellant was declared elected.   The defeated candidate - the respondent herein challenged the election of the appellant in an Election Petition.   The District Judge held that the nomination paper of the appellant was wrongly accepted and that her election was liable to be set aside since she could not contest the seat reserved for backward communities.   The appellant filed a revision before the High Court.   The High Court after consideration of the relevant aspects confirmed the decision of the District Court.   The court overruled the contention of the appellant that the Circular dated 12.0.3.1997 issued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh was restricted to employment or admission alone and did not apply to elections to local bodies.   The High Court also noticed the decisions of this Court in Valsamma Paul vs. Cochin University and others  ( 1996 (3) SCC 545 ), N.E. Horo vs. Smt. Jahan Ara Jaipal Singh (AIR  1972  SC 1840 ) and Kailash Sonkar vs.  Smt. Maya Devi ( AIR  1984  SC 600 ). 2.              In the light of the decision in Valsamma Paul vs. Cochin University and others (supra) and our decision rendered today in Civil Appeal Nos.4413-14 of 2003, which were heard along with this appeal, it must be held that the appellant, who by birth did not belong to a backward class or community, would not be entitled to contest a seat reserved for a backward class or community, merely on the basis of her marriage to a male of that community.   Therefore, it is not possible to accept the argument that the appellant was entitled to contest a seat reserved for a backward community merely because of her marriage to a person belonging to the Namdev community or caste.  We also see no reason to differ from the High Court in its view that the Circular dated 12.0.3.1997 was not restricted in its operation to employment and admission to an educational institution, but was also relevant and applicable in elections to local bodies.  It is, thus, found that both the reasons given by the High Court for affirming the decision of the District Judge setting aside the election of the appellant are sustainable.   In view of this we have no hesitation in confirming the decision of the High Court and in dismissing this appeal.   Hence, we dismiss this appeal with costs.","The appellant was born a Maharashtrian Barhmin. She married one Naresh Kumar Thakur who is a Namdev by caste.

" J U D G M E N T WITH CRIMINAL MISC.PETITION NO.4562 OF 2007 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant. The appeal was filed by the appellant against the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Sirsa convicting him for offence punishable under Section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (in short the ’Act’) and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- with default stipulation. 2.      Appeal before the High Court was disposed of in the absence of learned counsel for the appellant. The order itself noticed that with the assistance of learned counsel for the State, learned Single Judge perused the records and delivered the judgment. 3.      From the order of the High Court it appears that notice was issued to the appellant for engaging another counsel as the High Court noticed that he was not represented. It is noted in the order that there was no evidence to show that the notice was served on the appellant or not, yet the High Court disposed of the matter ex parte. 4.      In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that no notice was received by the appellant regarding non-appearance of his lawyer. In any event the lawyer who was earlier appearing had withdrawn form the case without any intimation to the appellant. 5.      Though several other points are raised in support of the appeal, it is not necessary to refer to them. Since the High Court itself was not sure whether notice was served or not, it should not have taken up the matter ex parte. The matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration on merits. As the matter is pending since long before the High Court, let the parties appear before the High Court without further notice on 16th July, 2007.

" O R D E R This appeal  arises from  the judgment  dated July  23, 1984 of  the Division  Bench of the Delhi High Court made in RFA No.281 of 1979. Notification  under   Section  4   [1]  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894 [for  short, the  ""Act""] acquiring  a large extent  of land  was published  on March  8, 1957. The land of  the appellant  admeasuring one  biga and  14 biswas formed part  of that  land.  Reference  Court  relying  upon judgment of  the High  Court in  A.N. Bhandari  v. Union  of India [LPA  No.81 of  1979 decided  on May  1, 1990] awarded compensation @  Rs.10/- per  square yard.  On appeal, it was confirmed. The  High Court relied upon a single sale deed in similar case  in which market value had been fixed @ Rs.12/- per square  yard. Therefore, the appellant also claimed that rate. Since  he was  not awarded the rate claimed by him, he has filed  appeal in  this Court  challenging  the  impugned judgment of the High Court. Shri  Juneja,   learned  counsel   for  the   appellant contended that  the High Court, having found that the market value of  the land  in question  could fetch was Rs.12/- per square yard,  would have  granted compensation at that rate. Though prima  facie we  find the  contention  plausible  and acceptable, in  view of  the legal  position that  at  least 1/3rd  of  the  market  value  has  to  be  deduced  towards development charges  and that the said consideration was not adopted in  the case  on which  reliance is placed, the fact boils down  that if  the award is to be interfered with, the appellant would  get less  than what has been granted to him by the  High Court.  However, since  the State has not filed any appeal  and in  the facts and circumstances of the case, we are  of the  view  that  it  is  not  a  case  warranting interference. The appeal under Section 54 of the Act would not lie to this Court.  A reading  of Section 54 would clearly indicate that the  appeal shall  lie in any proceedings under the act http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 only to  the High  Court against the award and decree of the reference Court  and further  appeal to  this Court would be under Article  136 of the Constitution read with Section 11, CPC. by way of special leave and not under Section 54 of the Act. Accordingly, this  appeal cannot  be treated  to be  an appeal under  Section 54 of the Act but one by special leave under Article 136. In either case, we do not find any ground warranting interference.  Hence the  appeal is dismissed. No costs.","The appeal  arises from the judgment  dated July  23, 1984 of the Division  Bench of the Delhi High Court made in RFA No.281 of 1979.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R [ Arising out of SLP [C] No.12079 of 2006 ] TARUN CHATTERJEE, J. 1.      Leave granted. 2.      This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 3/2/2006 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court at Hyderabad in second appeal No. 536 of 1994 and second appeal No. 561 of 1994. By the impugned judgment, the High Court has allowed the two appeals filed by the respondent and set aside the judgment of the appellate court thereby restoring the judgment and decree passed by the trial court decreeing the suit of the respondent. 3.      In our view, on a short question and without going into the merits, the judgment under appeal is liable to be set aside, as we find that the High Court, while entertaining the second appeal, has failed to frame the substantial question of law which is a mandatory requirement under section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code (for short \023CPC\024). It is true that the substantial question of law which arose for consideration, as observed by the High Court, was whether the lower appellate court was just and proper in throwing the burden against the plaintiff in O.S. No. 318/1981 to prove Exhibit \021B.1 agreement of sale executed in his favour. In our view, it was the duty of the High Court to specifically frame the question of law at the time of admission of appeal and thereafter, at the time of hearing of the second appeal, the question so framed should have been decided by the High Court. In our opinion, the question that was formulated at the time of hearing of the second appeal cannot be termed as a substantial question of law. (See Thiagarajan & Ors. V/s. Sri Venugopalaswami B. Koil & Ors (2004) 5 SCC 762) 4.      In any view of the matter, the substantial question of law referred to by the High Court in its impugned judgment was not a substantial question of law that could justify interference of the High Court under Section 100 of the CPC. 5.      For the reasons aforesaid, we have no alternative but to set aside the judgment of the High Court on the short question posed before us. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside. The High Court is directed to frame the substantial questions of law before the second appeal is taken up for hearing and after framing such substantial questions of law, the High Court shall dispose of the same within a period of 3 months from the date of supply of a copy of this order after giving hearing to the parties and without granting any unnecessary adjournments to either of them. For the reasons aforesaid, the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.

The Respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court which was allowed by the High Court by its impugned judgment and order. We have perused the judgment of the High Court. Apart from other reasons recorded by the High Court, we find that the link evidence adduced by the prosecution was not at all satisfactory. In the first instance, though the seized articles are said to have been kept in the malkhana on 20th May, 1995, the Malkhana register was not produced to prove that it was so kept in the malkhana till it was taken over by PW-6 on June 5, 1995. We further find that no sample of the seal was sent along with the sample to Excise Laboratory, Jodhpur for the purpose of comparing with the seal appearing on the sample bottles. Therefore, there is no evidence to prove satisfactorily that the seals found were in fact the same seals as were put on the sample bottles immediately after seizure of the contraband. These loopholes in the prosecution case have led the High Court to acquit the respondent. ...3/- -3- We find no error in the judgment of the High Court.

This  appeal is preferred against the judgment  of  the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissing the appeal preferred by the appellant under Section 269 (occurring in Chapter  XX-A) of the Income Tax Act. 3.The  appellant  purchased  a house at  Bhopal  under  a registered   sale  deed  dated  February  13,   1973.

" ORDER Admittedly,  the execution petition was filed by  Rajeshwari Amma,  Sukumara  Pillai  and  Neelamma  Pillai,  the   legal representatives  of the deceased Kolappa Pillai.  After  the execution  petition  was ordered by the  Court  of  District Munsif at Kuzhithurai in EP No. 274 of 1981 in OS No. 14  of 1961 dated 12-8-1981, the respondents carried it in revision to  the  High  Court.  Therein  only  the  deceased  Kolappa Pillai,  Rajeshwari Amma and Sukumara Pillai were  impleaded as  respondents omitting Neelamma Pillai.  In  other  words, the  order  of  the executing court  directing  delivery  of possession which was executed and possession taken in favour of  the  three  persons  was  challenged  against  only  two persons.   The  order  in favour of  third  person,  namely, Neelamma Pillai became final.  The execution petition  being of the same property which is undivided between the  decree- holders,  the  question emerges whether the High  Court  was right  in allowing CRP No. 2747 of 1982 by order dated  1-7- 1985 as against the unimpleaded respondent and whether  that order also comes in aid to the appellants.  On going through the record we find that there is some force in the arguments of  Shri G. Viswanatha Iyer, the learned Senior Counsel  for the  appellants.  Since the order of delivery-of  possession in  favour of the decree-holders is common  and  inseparable and since it has become final as against Neelamma, the  High Court  was not right in setting aside the order  as  against the  appellants.   No doubt, as rightly pointed out  by  the learned counsel for the respondents this contention was  not raised before the High Court.  But being a question of  law, it is open to be raised- and can be considered as the  order is an inseparable one.  Since the order against Neelamma had attained  finality,  we think that the High  Court  was  not right  in  reversing  the order of the  executing  court  as against two respondents.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel for the appellant and also parties-in-person. Notification was  issued calling  for the  applications for allotment  of houses  and the respondents had applied on April 20,  1993. the  last date  for making applications was May 31,1993.  After necessary  steps were taken and scrutiny was made,  lots were  drawn  of  June  7,  1994.  Since  the respondents remained  unsuccessful in  the lots, the earnest money deposited  by them refunded on July 20,1994 within one month. The question, therefore, is: whether the unsuccessful applicants would  be entitled to payment of interest for the period from the date of deposit till the date of refund? One of  the  condition  imposed  in  the  notification  inviting applications for  allotment was ""No interest shall be on the money of  the applicant for the period for which the same is lying  with   the  Authority.""  Having  accepted  the  above conditions, while applied for allotment, the respondents are not entitled  to the  payment of  interest  for  the  period during which the deposit was lying with the Authority. It is true that  there was an interlude of around one year between the date  of calling  applications and  the date  of draw of lots. It is obvious that the draw of lots was delayed due to administrative exigencies  and not  on account  of any  mala fide action  of any  individual; nor  is there  any absolute indifference on the part of the appellant in not drawing the lots. However,  it is  made clear that the appellant being a statutory authority  is expected  of perform  its duties  as expeditiously  as   possible  and  have  the  actions  taken quickly.

" ORDER Delay condoned. Shri Pramod  Swarup,  Advocate  takes  notice  for  the respondents. Leave granted. We have  heard the  counsel on  either side. The appeal arises from  the order  of single  Judge of  Allahabad  High Court  dated 28.2.1994 made in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 11535 of  1991. The  appellant in its planned development of urban areas, pursuant to U.P. Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, had engaged the respondents on daily wages in the project on  hand. They filed a writ petition claiming parity in appointment  and pay  with the regular employees and also for regularisation  of their  services.  The  single  Judge, while  negating   the  relief   of   regularisation,   given directions to  follow the  principles in  ss. 25F and 25G of the Industrial Disputes Act. Objention taken  by the  appellants is that ss. 25F and application. It  is stated that as regards the State of U.P. there is  a local Industrial Disputes Act and the provisions therein would be attracted, if Industrial Disputes Act is at all applicable  to the  appellant. It  is contended that the appellant is  not  an  industry  and  that,  therefore,  the principles contained in pari materia provisions in the local Act have no application. We have  gone through  the judgment  of the High Court. The learned  judge did  not intend  to  lay  down  that  the appellant is  an industry  and that the principles contained in the  Industrial Disputes  Act, Central  or the  State Act stands attracted.  What the  learned Judge  appears to  have intended to  lay down  is that  so long as the appellant has work on  hand, it  appellant has  no power  to terminate the contingent employees  engaged on daily wages and that in the event the  appellant needs  to terminate  their services the principle of  last come  first go  should be followed and in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the event  of there being need for re-employment, preference be given  to the displaced respondents. The observation made by the learned Judge is consistent with the well-established principles of  natural justice and equity, justice  and good conscience. Therefore,the learned Judge had rightly extended those principles  with regard to the persons employed by the appellant on daily wages. It is  stated that by implication of the order there is need for the appellant to keep engaging the respondents even though there are no projects on hand. That apprehension also does not  appear to  be correct. The appellant needs to take the services  of the persons according to the requirement in the projects on hand. On completion of the existing projects in which  the respondents  are  working,  if  the  appellant undertakes any fresh project, instead of taking the services of fresh  hands  at  the  place  of  the  new  project,  the appellant  needs  to  take  the  services  of  the  existing temporary daily  wage  respondents.  In  the  event  of  the appellant not  having any project on hand, the obligation to pay daily  wages to the respondents does not arise. However, the appellant  shall maintain  the order of seniority of the daily wage  employees and  shall take  the services  of  the senior most  persons in  the order of seniority according to the requirement of work. Since they  are temporary daily wage employees, so long as there  is no regular posts available for appointment, the question of  making pay  on par  with the  regular employees does not  arise. But the appellant should necessarily and by implication, pay  the minimum  wages  prescribed  under  the statute, if any, or the prevailing wages as available in the locality.

" J U D G M E N T HANSARIA, J. The petitioner  has  prayed  for  transfer  of  divorce proceedings pending  before  the  Family  Court,  Bombay  to Palanpur in the State of Gujarat. 2.   Being seized with a matrimonial matter, we thought that we should  make efforts to see if the parties can reconcile. For this  purpose we desired appearance of both the parties- in-person. Both  of them  came of  29th October and we heard their views.  It appears  to us  that reconciliation  is not presently possible for one reason or the other. 3.   Insofar as  the prayer  for transfer  is concerned,  we have not  felt inclined  to grant the same for the following reasons:- (a)   The  husband-respondent is  a medical practitioner and so his  absence from  Bombay would  cause difficulty  to his patients also. (b)  His old  and ailing mother lives with him at Bombay who needs frequent medical check-up and constant care. (c)   The witnesses in the case are principality from Bombay as would  appear  from  the  list  of  witnesses  which  was produced to us for our perusal. (d)  Petitioner-wife, has some near relations in Bombay. The petitioner, when  asked about this fact, did not really deny the same.  She, however, stated that they are not very close relatives and  accommodation with  them is insufficient. As, while coming  for the  trial, she  would be required to stay for a  day or  two only  at Bombay,  this is  not a material objection. (e)  The husband  has  undertaken  to  bear  the  travelling expenses of  the wife  as and  when she  would  travel  from Palanpur to Bombay to attend court proceedings. Let him also bear the expenditure of an escort. (f)   Palanpur  is well  connected  by  train  with  Bombay, because of  which the petitioner would not have to face much difficulty in undertaking the journey. 4.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short,  the ’Act’)  was published on January 23, 1965  acquiring about  14,000 bighas of land in Kalkaji, Tughalakabad for  planned development.  The dispute  in  the present proceedings  relates to  38 bighas,  5 biswas of the land. The  District Collector  awarded  compensation  @  Rs. 700/- per  bigha for lands with deep pits of 8 to 10 ft. The reference Court  enhanced the  compensation @ Rs. 4000/- per bigha.  The   High  Court   enhancing  the   compensation  @ Rs.7,000/- per bigha for land with pits and for the levelled hand, Rs.  17,000/- per bigha and deducted 1/3rd towards the development  charges   and   determined   the   compensation accordingly. Shri Mukul  Mudgal, learned  counsel for the appellant, contended  that   the  High   Court  having   enhanced  that compensation to  Rs. 40,000/-  per bigha for the levelled up land in  a similar case, compensation @ Rs.7,000/- per bigha for the  land with  pits of  a depth  of 8  to  10  feet  is illegal. It  is contended, on the other hand, by the learned counsel for the respondents that the compensation awarded by the High Court @ Rs.7,000/- per bigha for the land with deep pits of  8 to  10 feet  is just  and adequate.  There is  no warrant to enhance the compensation. He also states that the High Court had granted compensation for the levelled up land @ Rs.  40,000/- per bigha and deducted 1/3 but the  lands in question is  not on  the same  parity. The lands are clearly required to  be developed to bring on par with levelled land and huge  amount is  required for  development. Under  those circumstances, there  is no  warrant to  further enhance the compensation. In view  of the  rival contentions,  the  question  for consideration is: whether the grant of Rs. 7,000/- per bigha for the land, admittedly, with the deep pits of an extent of 8  to   10  feet   requires  further   enhancement  of   the compensation ?  It is  not in  dispute that the compensation granted @  Rs. 40,000/-  per bigha  was only in respect of a small piece  of land.  In all  the other case compensation @ http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Rs. 7,000/-  per bigha  of the  land in which there are deep pits of  the depth  8 to 10 feet has been awarded and become final. The lands require development and expenditure in that behalf is  needed. The  High Court  has considered  all  the relevant facts and found that uniform rate of Rs.7,000/- per bigha for  the land  with deep  pits of  8 to  10 feet depth would be  the proper  compensation. In  the absence  of  any compelling material, nor the High Court refused to advertto, we cannot  enhance the compensation from that awarded by the High Court  which was  not challenged by the Union of India. Under these  circumstances, we  do not find any circumstance warranting any interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the learned counsel on both sides. This appeal by special leave arises from the  judgment and decree  of the  High Court  of Bombay  in   First Appeal No.829 of  1982 made  on August  24, 1992.  The notification under Section  4 (1) was published in  respect of 2 acres of land covered  in Survey  No. 339/B  on October  30, 1965 and Survey No.339/A2  of 1 acre 34 gunthas on March 11, 1971 for the purpose  of  establishing  Market  Committee.  The  Land Acquisition Officer  awarded compensation  at the rate of 25 paise per sq. ft. in respect of B land acquired in the first notification and  35 paise  in respect of A land acquired in the second  notification. On reference under Section 18, the District Judge enhanced the compensation to the land covered under second notification at the rate of Rs.2.50 per sq. ft. and confirmed  the market  value determined by the Collector for the  land  covered  under  the  first  notification.  On appeal,  the   learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court,  while confirmed the  compensation determined  in respect  of lands covered   by   the   second   notification,   enhanced   the compensation to  Rs.1.20 per  sq. ft.  in respect  of  lands acquired by the first notification. The claimants have filed this appeal  for further  hike in compensation whereas State has not come up in appeal. It is  settled by series of this Court’s judgments that determination of  the compensation  in respect  of the lands acquired  on  the  sq.  ft.  basis  is  an  obvious  illegal principle being  adopted by  the courts  only to inflate the market value  and no  reasonable prudent  purchaser would be willing to purchase the land on the sq. ft. basis when large extent of  land is  offered for  sale. Same is the case when land is acquired for public purpose. The courts are required to considers  sitting  in  the  arm  chair  of  the  prudent purchaser acting in normal conditions prevailing in the open market, whether,  when offered  to purchase  the land  by  a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 willing vendor,  he would  purchase  the  same  in  an  open market. The  Court on  that touchstone  should evaluate  the market value.  No feat  of imagination is necessary to cloud the consideration lest it runs into arena of misconduct. The courts, therefore,  have proceeded  on  illegal  premise  in determining the  compensation on  sq. ft.  basis. It is seen that the  High Court noted that there is no development from 1968 to  1971. It  is true that the High Court has proceeded on wrong  footing of the date of notification of 1968. There appears  to   be  some   confusion  with   regard  to  first notification  dated   October  30,   1965  and   the  second notification dated  March 11, 1971. In view of the fact that there is  no hike in the value of the land and no sale deeds have been  produced, it  would be  obvious that  there is no appreciation of  the value  of the  lands. So  it is  highly hazardous to  rely upon oral evidence wherein witnesses have stated that  prevailing market  value ranges  from Rs.4/- to Rs.5/- per  sq. ft.  Under these  circumstances, we  are not impressed with any evidence warranting further increase. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the single  judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur Bench, made on 28.10.1996 in W.P.. No.4472/96. A charge-sheet  has been given to the petitioner on the allegation  that   he  sanctioned   loan  for   non-existing fictitious persons  and got  disbursement of  demand  drafts mentioned in the charge-sheet within two days, i.e. December 10, 1990  and December  11,1990 in  favour of M/s. Sudarshan Trading Co.  of  Bhopal  for  Rs.2,80,000/-.  on  the  basis thereof,  the   respondents  imputed   that  the  petitioner committed the  misconduct. An enquiry had been initiated and is now  being proceeded  against him he filed an application for permission  to engage  the services  of an advocate. The permission  was   refused.  In   the  writ   petition,.  the petitioner contended  that the chargesheet was filed against him in the criminal court for the self-same offence. in view of the  fact that  the matter  is pending  in  the  criminal Court, an  assistance of  the advocate  is necessary.  Since presenting officer  of the Bank is a law graduate, denial of the assistance of the advocate is violative of principles of natural justice.  The High  Court has  held that  since  the facts are  not complicated and the presenting officer of the Bank is  not a  legally trained  person,  assistance  of  an advocate is  not mandatory in the domestic enquiry. On these simple facts, he could himself or through any other employee defend the  case without  the assistance  of an advocate. On that  basis,   the  High  Court  has  held  that  denial  of assistance of  an advocate is not violative of principles of natural justice. Learned counsel  for the petitioner contends that since the chargesheet has already been filed and criminal trial is pending,  any   enquiry  conducted  against  the  petitioner himself or  any of the officer, as notified in para 19.12 of the bi-partite  settlement, would  prejudicially affect  the petitioner’s  case   and  therefore,   the  denial   of  the assistance of  an advocate is violative of the principles of natural justice. we find no force in the contention. As per the Rule 19.12 of the bi-partite settlement, the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 permission to  defend himself  with the  assistance  of  the advocate is  one of  the option  to be given by the Bank. We have perused the chargesheet in the enquiry now sought to be proceeded against  the petitioner . The allegations are very simple  and   they  are   not   complicated.

" ORDER The respondent  filed a  petition under  Section of the West Bengal  Land Reforms  Act for  preemption in respect of two sale  deeds executed  by the  vendors on  22nd and  23rd February 1977  transferring 1.70  acres of land in two plots in favour  of the  appellant. The  appellants  resisted  the respondent’s claim  for preemption  on the  ground that  the respondent need  to have  been a  co-sharer in the land sold and since he claims to have purchased sometime in the past a portion of  a plot, which was purchased sometime in the past a portion  of a  plot, which  was described  in the  revenue records as  a ‘tank’,  it was  not ‘land’  as defined in the Land Reforms  Act and  therefore he was not a co-sharer. The trial court  found  that  the  pre-emptor  had  purchased  a portion of  a plot which was a ‘doba’ and since ‘doba’ was a tank, it  was outside the definition of land provided in the Land Reforms  Act. The  appellate court  concurred with that view. The  High Court,  however, in second appeal up set it. To adjudge the correctness of the View of the High Court are the present appeals at the instance of the vendees. Miss Aruna  Banerjee, learned counsel appearing for the appellants has  placed before  us the English translation of the deed  of sale  in favour of the respondent together with the copy  of the  original deed  in Bengali.  There the land sold to  the pre-emptor  has been  described as ""Matsyasheho Pushkarini"" which in English means a tank/pond full of fish. The learned  Single Judge  of the High Court in relying upon an earlier decision of the that Court in Niranjan Das Versus Lakshmi Mani  Dasi, 1986  Calcutta Weekly Note 318 has taken the view  that ‘doba’  does not  come within the mischief of the word ‘tank’ as is apparent from the Wilson’s Glossary of words. We  have caused a copy thereof to be placed before us and we  find therefrom that the word ‘doba’ in Bengali means immersed, low  and swampy  or inundated  land. The  depth of such land  perhaps comes  to cause  a distinction  between a ‘doba’ and  a ‘tank’.  Apparently the  High Court was of the View that  if surface  waters be shallow, then the land even though inundated  will retain  the character  of  the  land, bearing at the back of its mind that paddy crop can be grown in puddled  lands. correspondingly,  if the  depth  is  more http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 which prevents  the land  being put to agricultural use then it would  be ‘tank’ for the purposes of the West Bengal Land Refors Act  and in  particular Section  2(7) thereof,  which defines ‘land’  to  be  agricultural  land,  tank  being  an exception there  to. Now here the land has been described as ‘Matsyasheo Pushkarini’  which apparently  would mean a pond with sufficient water abounding in fish and seemingly it was so  described   in  the  deed  of  sale  in  favour  of  the respondent. Thus  the area  owned by  the respondent did not come within the ambit of the word ‘land’ for the purposes of Section 2(7)  of the  West Bengal  Land Reforms Act 1995 and therefore the  respondent was  dis-entitled to claim himself as co-sharer  in the  land in  order to maintain a claim for pre-emption. In  our view  the High  Court was  in error  in proceeding on  the basis  that the  land  purchased  by  the respondent was  put to  agricultural use in the manner which entitled the  respondent to  a  decree  in  his  favour.  We therefore, upset  the judgment  and order  of the High Court and order  restoration of the judgment and and decres of the Courts below but without any order as to costs.","The High Court was of the View that if surface  waters be shallow, then the land even though inundated will retain the character of the land.

" ORDER 1.   Special leave granted. 2.   Heard  counsel  on  both  sides.   The  respondent  was visited  with the punishment of dismissal from service.   He filed  a  departmental appeal which came  to  be  dismissed, whereupon he moved the High Court by way of a writ petition. The High Court quashed the order of the appellate  authority on the ground that no personal hearing was given before  the appeal  was dismissed.  The matter was, therefore,  remitted to  the appellate authority to dispose of the  appeal  after hearing  the delinquent personally.  It is against the  said order that the present appeal is filed. 3.   No  rule  has  been  brought  to  our  attention  which requires  the  appellate  authority  to  grant  a   personal hearing.   The rule of natural justice does not  necessarily in  all  cases confer a right of audience at  the  appellate stage.   That  is what this Court observed in  F.N.  Roy  v.

But that was not a case of a departmental inquiry, it was one emanating  from Article  324 of the Constitution.

We,  therefore, set aside the impugned order and  remit the  matter back to the High Court for disposal of the  writ petition  on  the  other  grounds  and  contentions   raised therein.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI. J. The appellants  have been  convicted under  Section 302 read with 34 IPC for causing death of Ranbir Singh. The deceased was the son-in-law of appellant No.1 Mange Ram, and  husband of appellant No.2 Somwati. Both the courts below believed  the dying decelerations made by the deceased before the  Investigating Officer  and Dr.  Tiwari, and they have been  made the  basis of  his conviction.  We have gone through the  evidence of Dr. Tiwari who was the first person to record  the dying declaration. He was stated that when he inquired from  the patient how he had received burn injuries he had stated that at about 9.10. p.m. he was in his in-laws house and  his father-in-law  Manger Ram  and his  wife  put kerosene oil on him and set him of fire. The defence was not able to  take out  anything in  his cross  examination which could  create   any  doubt  regarding  truthfulness  of  his evidence. A.S.I.  Harpal Singh (P.W. 24) who had gone to the hospital on  receiving information about admission of Ranbir Singh in  the hospital has stated that he recorded the F.I.R of Ranbir  Singh at  about 11.45  p.m. Therein  also  Ranbir Singh has stated that his father-in-law and his wife had set him on  fire. Both  these dying declarations have been found reliable and  consistent by  the courts  below and we see on reason to  differ from  the finding. The learned counsel for the appellant  was not  able to  suggest any  good reason to disbelieve the  evidence of  Dr. Tiwari  and  A.S.I.  Harpal Singh. He, however,  drew our attention to the statement, made by appellant  No.1 Mange  Ram when  he  was  examined  under Section 313  of the  Criminal Procedure  Code wherein he has stated that he was not residing in House No.80, which though belonged to  him was  in occupation of his daughter and son- in-law and  that he  had gone  to that  house after  he  was informed about  the incident.  He also drew our attention to the evidence  of P.W.  8 Hari Singh who has also stated that Mange Ram  had come there after the neighbors had collected. He then submitted that as the version given by Mange Ram was supported by  a prosecution  witness it  ought to  have been accepted and  it should  have been  held that he was falsely http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 involved by  the appellant.  P.W. 8  has stated that when he had gone  inside the house he had seen Ranbir Singh lying on a cot  and groaning  in pain.  He was under the influence of liquor. But the evidence of doctor does not show that Ranbir Singh was under the influence of liquor. On the contrary his evidence is that, when he was brought to the hospital Ranbir Singh was under the influence of liquor. On the contrary his evidence is  that, when  he was  brought  to  the  hospital, Ranbir Singh  has in  full senses  and  was  able  to  speak clearly. It clearly appears that P.W. 8 being a neighbor was trying  to   help  the  appellant  by  deposing  like  that. Therefore, no reliance can be placed upon his evidence. As we  do not  find any  substance in this appeal it is dismissed. The  appellants were  released on bail during the pedency of this appeal. Their bail is cancelled and they are ordered to  surrender to  custody to serve out the remaining part of their sentence.","The deceased was the son-in-law of appellant No.1 Mange Ram, and the husband of appellant.

No.2130 of 1980 Notification under  s.4(1) of  the Land Acquisition Act was published  on November  13, 1959 acquiring 1876 Bighas 9 Biswas land  situated in  Jwalaharior planned development of Delhi. The  Land Acquisition  Collector classified the lands as A,B,  C block  and awarded @ Rs. 1400/- and Rs.1000/- per bigha respectively.  On reference under s.18 of the Act, the Additional District  Judge by  his Award  and  Decree  dated September 8,  1979  further  enhanced  the  compensation  to Rs.4250/- 3200/- and 2150/- per bigha respectively. The High Court, on  appeal,  further  enhanced  the  compensation  to Rs.5250/-  4000/-   and  3000/-   respectively.  Not   being satisfied with the enhanced compensation awarded by the High Court, the  claimants have filed these appeals under s.54 of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Act     claiming enhanced  compensation @ Rs.9.000/- per bigha. The  High   Court  found   that  there   are  no   sale transactions in  the village  Jwalahari other  than one sale transaction in  village Madipur which is said to be adjacent to the  village Jwalahari that sale deed was dated April 20, 1959 just  before the Notification. An extent of 1472.22 sq. yards was  sold in  Khasra No.828  for  a  consideration  of Rs.7726/- which  worked out  at Rs.5250/-  per bigha.  Based thereon, the High Court has enhanced the compensation. It is now a  settled principle that the price of a small extent of land cannot  form the  sole basis  for  fixation  of  higher compensation when  a large  track of land is acquired. Since the State  did not  file any appeal. we need not go into the correctness of  the finding  recorded  by  the  High  Court. Suffice it  to state  that there  is no  other  evidence  on record for us to further enhance the compensation. It is  next contended that the High Court having made a distinction between the owner and the mortgagee and enhanced 25% extra compensation to the owner, committed a grave error of law  in not  awarding the same to the appellants. We find no discernible  principle made  by the High Court to further enhance 25%  more to  the owner  while awarding  the  market value to the mortgagee. Under these circumstances, we do not find any  legal principle  warranting further enhancement of 25%  extra   compensation.  The   appeals  are   accordingly dismissed but, in the circumstances, without costs. All application  for  substitutions  consolidation  and reduction of security are allowed. C.A.

Admittedly, the suit  lands are  governed by  the provisions of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition  and Land  Reforms Act, 1951 [for short, ’the Act’].  The appellant  had raised  the objection to the jurisdiction of  the civil court in his defence in the trial court. He pleaded thus : ""The suit  is barred  under the provisions of Section 331  of U.P. Zamindari & Land Reforms Act.  The   sale  is  not  barred  under  the provisions of  Section 168-A of Z.A. Act. The plaintiff’s suit  is liable  to be  dismissed with costs."" In the  appellate court  also the  same point  has been reiterated but negatived. The second appeal was dismissed by the High Court in limine. Thus this appeal by special leave. This Court  in Chandrika  Misir &  Anr. vs.  Bhaiya Lal [1974 (1)  SCR 290]  had to  deal with the same question. It was held that:- ""Sections  209  and  331  of  U.P.  Zamindari Abolition and  Land Reforms  Act, 1951,  when read together,  showed that  a suit, like the present one,  had to  be filed  in a  Special http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court created  under the  Act within a period of limitation  specially prescribed under the Rules   made   under   the   Act,   and   the jurisdiction of  the ordinary Civil Courts to entertain the suit was absolutely barred. Since the  Civil Court  which entertained the suit  suffered   from  an  inherent  lack  of jurisdiction because of special provisions of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1951,  the present  appeal filed  by the appellants had to be dismissed."" The above  ratio applies  to the facts in this case. As pointed out earlier, the lands are covered by the provisions of the  Act and  express objection as to the jurisdiction of the civil  court was raised. The appellant had purchased 0.7 acres of  land out  of 2.17  acres. The abadi site comprises one Kachha  Kotha and  Ghar having boundary walls. Since the lands are  admittedly covered  by the provisions of the Act, the Civil  Court inherently  lacked jurisdiction  to go into the question of title. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed and the suit stands dismissed in  so far  as it  relates to  0.7. acres  of land purchased by the appellant. No costs.","Mr. K.K.

" WITH SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION [C] NO. 19030 OF 1996 [CC - 4204/96] O R D E R These Special  Leave Petitions  have been filed against the orders  passed in  W.P. No.5196/89 on March 12, 1990 and W.P. No.1552/96  on April  26, 1996.  There is absolutely no merit for  condonation  of  delay  in  the  the  first  writ petition. As regards the second writ petition, the facts are not in dispute. Way back in 1974, notification under Section 126(4) of  the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act [""MRTP Act"", for short] was issued after the approval of the Scheme by  the   State  Government,  for  acquiring  the  land  for utilisation thereof for the stated Scheme. Pursuant thereto, an award  came to  be passed by the Land Acquisition Officer under Section  11 of  the Land  Acquisition Act,  1894  (for short, the ""Act"") on November 11, 1977. Possession was taken earlier on  October 21,  1974. After  the utilisation of the land, surplus  land was  sought to  be used for allotment to some of  the Councilors  and the  employees of  the Kolhapur Municipality. Consequently,  the first writ petition came to be filed  which was  dismissed on  merits on March 12, 1990. Thereafter, the  petitioners filed  a suit  challenging  the acquisition and suit came to be dismissed as withdrawn being not maintainable.  Writ Petition  No.  1552/96  came  to  be filed. That  writ petition  was also dismissed on the ground that the  earlier order in the writ petition operated as res judicate. Therefore, the second writ petition was held to be not maintainable. Shri Naik,  learned senior  counsel appearing  for  the petitioners, contended that in the second writ petition, the petitioner sought  restitution of the possession pursuant to the Resolution  of the  State Government  dated October  10, 1973 under  which Government  directed that the surplus land was to be utilised first for any other public purpose and in the alternative  it was  to be  given back  to the erstwhile owners.  Since   he  had  sought  enforcement  of  the  said Government  Resolution,  the  writ  petition  could  not  be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 dismissed on  the ground  of constructive  res judicate.  He also seeks  to rely  upon certain  orders said  to have been passed by  the High  Court in conformity with enforcement of the Government  Resolution. We  do not think that this Court would be  justified in  making direction  for restitution of the land to the erstwhile owners when the land was taken way back  and   vested  in   the  Municipality   free  from  all encumbrances. We  are not concerned with the validity of the notification  in   either  of  the  writ  petitions.  It  is axiomatic that  the land acquired for a public purpose would be utilised for any another public purpose, though use of it was intended  for the  original public  purpose. It  is  not intended that  any land  which remain  unutilised, should be restituted  to   the  erstwhile   owner  to   whom  adequate compensation was  paid according  to the  market value as on the date of the notification. Under these circumstances, the High Court was well justified in refusing to grant relief in both the writ petitions. The special leave petitions are dismissed.","Special Leave Petitions have been filed against the orders passed in W.P. No.5196/89 on March 12, 1990.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the Division Bench  judgement  of  the  Allahabad  High  Court,  made  on November 9, 1995 in Special Appeal No. 302/95. The admitted position is that the respondent came to be appointed on  daily wage basis on February 14, 1985 as Class IV employee,  Nursing Orderly, in the Medical College be the Medical Superintendent.  When the  respondent filed  a  writ petition in  the High  Court  for  his  regularisation,  the learned single Judge pointed out that the respondent has not brought to  the notice  of the   Court,  any statutory  rule under which  the respondent  could be  regularised,  on  the basis of the service rendered by him as a daily wage earner. Even the method of recruitment adopted by the Superintendent was not proper inasmuch as the did not call application. The Division reversed  the decision  of the learned single Judge and had  give direction.  It is  now settled  legal position that there  should exist  a post  and either  administrative instructions or  statutory rules  must be  in  operation  to appoint a  person to  the post.  Daily wage appointment will obviously be  in relation  to  contingent  establishment  in which there  cannot exist  any post and it continues so long as the  work exists.

" The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K.   JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.- Special leave granted. 2.   The appellant was tried for an offence punishable under Section  302 IPC and has been ultimately found guilty  under Section 304 Part II IPC and sentenced to undergo four years’ RI  and to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 in default of payment  of which to further undergo one year’s RI. 3.   The facts of the prosecution case are that on April  2, 1986  at  about 2 p.m. the appellant came in  front  of  the house  of Jia Lal, deceased and there was a quarrel and  the appellant  kicked the deceased on his testicles as a  result of which the deceased fell down.  The appellant again kicked on the testicles of the deceased.  The wife and daughter  of the deceased intervened and they removed the injured to  the house and later he was shifted to the hospital only on April 4,  1986.   The  doctor found a  diffused  swelling  on  the scrotum  and penis and skin over the scrotum and  penis  was found to be blackening and gangrenous and he was treated  in the hospital.  Because of the gangrene the deceased died  on April 5, 1986.  A case was registered under Section 302 IPC. Dr  Naveen Sabharwal, PW 8 conducted the postmortem  and  he opined  that  the death was due to toxemia  because  of  the gangrene  which  could be the result of the  injury  to  the testicles.   PW  6,  another doctor  again  gave  a  medical opinion that the duration between injury and the death could not  be given because the cause of death was toxemia due  to gangrene.  The doctor also admitted that because of the lack of immediate medical help, the gangrene developed. 4.   Both  the  courts below have accepted  the  prosecution case   that  the  appellant  kicked  the  deceased  on   the testicles.   The High Court held that by giving such  kicks, the appellant had knowledge that he was likely to cause  the death  and accordingly convicted him under Section 304  Part II IPC. 5.   Having  regard to the medical opinion,  admittedly  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 injury  to the testicles was not the direct cause of  death. No treatment was given for two days and it is only on  April 4, 1986 that the deceased was admitted in the hospital. but, unfortunately,  in the meanwhile gangrene developed.   Under the circumstances the offence only amounts to one punishable under  Section 323 PC. In the result, the conviction of  the appellant under Section 304 Part 11 IPC and the sentence  of four years’ RI awarded thereunder are set aside.  Instead he as convicted under Section 323 IPC and sentenced to  undergo seven  months’ RI. the sentence of fine with default  clause and  the direction that the whole amount should be  paid  to the  heirs of the deceased, are confirmed.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(2) SCR 489 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Crl. A. No. 708/2001. The respondent Nihal Singh is a convict under Section 302 IPC sentenced by Court Martial to undergo imprisonment for life and incarcerated in civil jail, Sangruru (Punjab). Nihal Singh filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana seeking to be classified as Class-B prisoner and being allowed the facilities available to such prisoners in accordance with para 576-A of the Punjab Jail Manual. Punjab Jail Manual is a compilation of statutory provisions, rules and executive instructions, referrable to prison and prisoners, issued from time to time and is meant to guide the jail administration and the jail officers. Para 576-A contemplates classification of convicted persons into 3 categories, namely, Classes A, and C and catalogues the factors which would be relevant for classification and enumerates the benefits and facilities to which the prisoner would be entitled depending on the classification. The petition came up for hearing before a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana, who formed an opinion that the classification of prisoners into Classes A, B and C was violative of Articles 14 and 15 (1) of the Constitution, and therefore, declared such classification ultra vires of the Constitution, Consequent upon such declaration the petition filed by the respondent was directed to be dismissed. It is pertinent to note that the question of vires of 576-A of Punjab Jail Manual was not raised by anyone before the High Court. The High Court also, before formulating its opinion as expressed in the impugned order, did not give any indication of its mind that adjudication upon the constitutional validity of the provision was proposed. None was put on notice. Nobody was afforded an opportunity of bringing on record material relevant for adjudication upon such validity. The Advocate General of the State was not put on notice. The procedure adopted by the High Court while invalidating para 576-A of the Punjab Jail Manual was wholly unsatisfactory and unsustainable. For the short reason as abovesaid and without expressing any opinion on the merits or otherwise of the finding arrived at by the High Court, the judgment under appeal is set aside. The writ petition filed by the respondent shall stand restored on the file of the High Court for hearing and decision afresh and in accordance with law. The appeal stands disposed of. Crl. A.

A. No. 708/2001. The occasion for filing these two appeals by special leave arose because the judgment delivered by the High Court in the case of Nihal Singh was circulated by the State Governments to jail authorities in the States of Punjab and Haryana - both. Acting upon the said judgment the jail authorities in State of Haryana withdrew the facilities extended to the prisoners based upon classification as per para S76-A of Punjab Jail Manual which was adopted for administration of jails in the State of Haryana also. In as much as the judgment of the High Court in the case of Nihal Singh has already been set aside, these appeals have become infructuous and are accordingly disposed of.","Nihal Singh filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana seeking to be classified as Class-B prisoner.

" J U D G M E N T This appeal has been preferred by the State of Kerala against the order of acquittal dated 18th February, 1999 recorded by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in Criminal Appeal No.407 of 1998. The sole accused was the respondent herein who was charged of the offence of murder for having caused the death of Lakshmi Amma in order to commit theft of a pair of ear-studs and a gold chain on the evening of September 3, 1992. The case of the prosecution is that he beat her with a spade and thereafter buried her dead body in his land. The case rests purely on circumstantial evidence. There is no direct evidence to prove that the respondent had either assaulted the deceased or had buried her dead body. In order to prove its case, the prosecution relied upon three main circumstances. The first circumstance is that PW-3 was shown two ear tops by the accused at the bus stop. ...2/- -2- Secondly, the respondent had mentioned about the ear tops and chain to PW-2 though he had not shown them to him. In his statement to the police he had mentioned only about the chain and not about the ear- studs. Lastly, it was the case of the prosecution that the respondent had buried the dead body of the deceased in his own field and the said body was recovered on the basis of the disclosure statement made by the respondent himself. The High Court found the circumstances either not established or insufficient to prove the case against the respondent. So far as PW-3 is concerned, the High Court found it wholly unnatural for the respondent to go to him at the bus stop and show him two ear tops without any reason. This witness was examined by the police in the course of investigation one year after the occurrence. The High Court did not find this part of the prosecution case to be reliable. The second circumstance namely that the accused had talked about the ear tops and chain to PW-2 was also not found believable particularly when PW-2 was not even shown those ear tops and chain. In fact the ear tops and the chain were never recovered and therefore, not produced at the trial. ...3/- -3- As to the most important circumstance namely the recovery of the dead body at the instance of the respondent, the High Court found the evidence relating to the same to be unacceptable. The evidence on record disclosed that a part of the dead body was exposed and had come out from the grave and was visible. The second reason for disbelieving the disclosure statement was that even before the body http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was exhumed, a large number of persons had already collected there, which itself established that the fact was known to everyone in the village, and the body was really not discovered at the instance of the respondent. We have gone through the material placed before us but we find no reason to disturb the findings recorded by the High Court, particularly in an appeal against acquittal. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.","The appeal has been preferred by the State of Kerala against the order of acquittal dated 18th February, 1999 recorded by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in Criminal Appeal No.407 of 1998.

" THE 24TH DAY OF APRIL, 1998 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Hon’ble Mr. Justice S.P. Kurdukar P.P. Malhotra, Sr.Adv., Rajiv Nanda, Arvind Kumar Sharma, Ms. Sushma Suri, Advs. with him for the appellants. Ms. Sarla Chandra, Adv. for the Respondents. J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI . J. Delay condoned. Special leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The only  question which  arises for  consideration  in these appeals is whether the Central Administrative Tribunal was right  in allowing  the application  of the  respondents directing the  appellants to step up their pay so as to make it at  par with  the pay of B.C. Mishra who was their junior but getting a  higher pay. It is  held by  the Tribunal  that the  respondents and Mishra belonged  to the same cadre and their pay scales were also the  same in  the lower posts and,  therefore, they are entitled to  the benefit  of stepping  up .  But,  what  the Tribunal has  failed  to  take  into  consideration  is  the Circular dated  4.11.1993 issued by the Government of India, Department of  Personnel &   Training which clearly provides that the  anomaly for granting benefit of stepping up of pay should be  directly  as  a  result  of  the  application  of fundamental rule  22-C and  that if a junior officer draws a higher pay  in the  lower post  either  because  of  advance increments or  on any  other account  then the  provision of stepping up  would not  apply in  such a  case. Moreover  in paragraph 2(c) of the Circular it is, further, provided that if a  senior joins  the higher  post, later than the junior, for whatsoever  reason, whereby  he draws  less pay than the junior, in  such a  case senior cannot, claim stepping up of pay at per with the junior. In this case what had happened was that the respondents and Mishra  were appointed  as typists  clerks on  different dates but   were  promoted to  the post of Welfare Inspector http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Grade   -III on  the same date. Mishra was promoted to Grade II earlier  than the  respondents on  ad hoc  basis. He  was promoted as Welfare Inspector Grade II on 1.2.1981 on ad hoc basis and worked continuously on the higher post upto 1.1.84 on which  date the  two respondents and Mishra were promoted as Welfare  Inspectors Grade  II on  regular basis.  At that time he  was getting  a  higher  pay  than  the  respondents because of  his earlier  ad hoc  promotion. Mishra was again promoted as  Welfare Inspector  Grade I  on ad hoc basis and worked on  that post  continuously from  28.7.86 to 13.1.93. On 13.1.93 the respondents and Mishra were promoted to Grade I on  regular basis.  On that date also Mishra was getting a higher pay  because of  his  ad  hoc  promotion  as  Welfare Inspector Grade  I. It was for that reason that Mishra, even though  was   a  junior,  was  getting  more  pay  than  the respondents. In  view of these facts, the Circular governing stepping up  of pay  issued by the Railway Board and the law laid down  by this Court in Union of India & Others Vs. O.P. Saxena (   1997   (6)   SCC   360 ) the respondents were not entitled to  the benefit  of stepping up. The Tribunal, thus committed  an   error  in   granting  that  benefit  to  the respondents.   We ,  therefore, allow  these appeals and set aside the impugned orders of the Tribunal. No order as to costs.","B.C. Mishra was promoted to Grade II earlier than the respondents on  ad hoc  basis.

" JUDGMENT With arising outS.L.P.(C) No. 21676/2001 P. Venkatarama Reddi, J. Leave granted in S.L.P.(C) No. 21676/2001. 1.              The respondents were appointed as Conductors/ Drivers on daily-wage basis in the then Madras State Transport Department (MSTD). Their services were regularized one or two years later. When the Pallavan Transport Corporation and Kattabomman Transport Corporation were formed, they were sent on deputation to the said Corporations which were bifurcated subsequently and they were permanently absorbed in the service of the said Corporations after calling for options from the respondents. By G.O.No. 1028 (Transport) dated 23.9.1985 read with G.O.No. 284 (Finance) dated 31.3.1980, the cutoff date for the purpose of eligibility to pension in respect of the erstwhile State Transport Department employees was fixed as 1.5.1975. Later on i.e., by G.O.MS.No. 250 (Transport) dated 18.11.1996 the crucial date was changed to 15.9.1975. If the date 1.5.1975 or 15.9.1975 is to be taken into account, the respondents will become eligible for pensionary benefit only if their service was counted from the date of initial appointment, otherwise, they would not be completing ten years of qualifying service by 15.9.1975. As the appellants took the stand that the daily-wage service will not count in reckoning the qualifying service as per the Tamilnadu Pension Rules, the respondents filed writ petitions seeking direction to calculate their qualifying service in the MSTD from the date of their initial appointment as daily- wage employees instead of counting it from the date of their absorption on regular basis in Government service. 2.              Writ appeal No. 545 of 1998 which is the subject matter of S.L.P.(C) No. 21676 of 2001 filed by the respondents herein was allowed and directions were issued to calculate the writ petitioners’ qualifying service from the date of their initial entry into service and to sanction and release the pensionary benefits accordingly. Writ appeal No. 1411 of 1994 which has given rise to Civil Appeal No. 494 of 2002 filed by the State of Tamilnadu against the order of the learned single Judge allowing the writ petition was dismissed. 3.              It becomes practically unnecessary to go into the question whether the daily-wage service should also be counted towards qualifying service for the reason that by a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 judgment pronounced today in Civil Appeal Nos. 1444- 1445/1999 etc., we have held, affirming the view of the High Court that the fixation of the cutoff date as 1.5.1975 or 15.9.1975 is unconstitutional and we directed that the eligibility to pension should be assessed with reference to the cutoff date 1.4.1982. If that date is taken into account, indisputably, the respondents will be having sufficient qualifying service to earn pension as per the State Government rules, even if the daily-wage service is excluded. 4.              The appeals are therefore disposed of in terms of directions given in our judgment pronounced today in Civil Appeal Nos. 1444-1445/1999 etc. No costs.","The respondents were appointed as Conductors/ Drivers on daily-wage basis in the then Madras State Transport Department (MSTD) Their services were regularized one or two years later.

J. The appellant has been convicted under  Section  25 of  the  Arms  Act  and Section 5 of the TADA Act as he was found in possession of one DBBL gun.  12 bore and five live cartridges on 17/18.3.1992.  The trial court  relying  upon the  evidence  of  ASI - Balbir Singh and P.W.4 - Man Singh who were the members of the Police party held that  it  was proved  by  the  prosecution  that  the  appellant  was  in possession of those articles.  The trial court further held that as the gun was found loaded, it can be  presumed  that it was in working order.  Taking this view it convicted the appellant, as stated above. Admittedly,  no evidence was led by the prosecution to prove that the gun was in working condition and that the cartridges  which  were  found  from  the  person  of   the appellant were live cartridges.  Neither ASI - Balbir Singh had stated so nor any report from an expert was obtained to establish  that  the  gun was in working condition and that five cartridges were live.  What was found in the gun  were two  empties and not live cartridges and, therefore, it was not proper to presume that it was in working condition.  In absence of any evidence to that effect, the  conviction  of the appellant under both these aforesaid Sections cannot be upheld.   We,  therefore,  allow this appeal, set aside the judgment  and  order  passed  by  the   Additional   Judge, Designated  Court,  Sangrur,  in  Special Sessions Case No. 55/92 and acquit the  appellant.

" J U D G M E N T I.A. 3 OF 2006 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7797 OF 2003 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. By this application, the applicant who was the respondent in the appeal has prayed for clarification of the order dated 2.8.2005 in the concerned Civil Appeal No. 7797 of 2003. It is stated that the applicant (respondent in the civil appeal) is living in penury, has no means to pay back the amount which is sought to the recovered.  The pension amount has already being attached and the balance is now being sought to be recovered. Learned counsel for the appellant-Corporation on the other hand submitted that in the guise of application for clarification, review of the judgment is being sought for. By order dated 2nd August, 2005 it was held that the learned Single judge and the Division Bench had erroneously granted the benefits of increment notionally to the applicant during the period when he was out of service. The petition is in essence and substance seeking for a review under the guise of making an application for clarification apparently being fully aware of the normal procedure that such applications for review are not, unless Court directs, listed for open hearing in court, at the initial stage at least, before ordering notice to the other side and could be summarily rejected, if found to be of no prima facie merit. The move adopted itself is unjustified, and could not be countenanced also either by way of review or in the form of the present application as well. The nature of relief sought, and the reasons assigned are such that even under the pretext of filing a review such an exercise cannot be undertaken, virtually for re-hearing and alteration of the judgment because it is not to the liking of the party, when there is no apparent error on record whatsoever to call for even a review. The said move is clearly misconceived and nothing but sheer abuse of process, which of late is found to be on the increase, more for selfish reasons than to further or strengthen the cause of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 justice. The device thus adopted, being otherwise an impermissible move by mere change in nomenclature of the applications does not change the basic nature of the petition. Wishful thinking virtually based on surmises too, at any rate is no justification to adopt such undesirable practices. If at all it should be for weighty and substantial reasons. It is to be noted that a review application can be filed under Article 137 of the Constitution read with Order XL of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 (in short the Rules). Rule 3 of Order XL is significant. It reads as follows:- ""Rule 3 - Unless otherwise ordered by the Court an application for review shall be disposed of by circulation without any oral arguments, but the petitioner may supplement his petition by additional written arguments. The Court may either dismiss the petition or direct notice to the opposite party. An application for review shall as far as practicable be circulated to the same Judge or Bench of Judges that delivered the judgment or order sought to be reviewed."" In Delhi Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban and Ors. (2000 (7) SCC 296), it was held that by describing an application one for ""clarification"" or ""modification"" though it is really one of review a party cannot be permitted to circumvent or bypass the circulation procedure and indirectly obtain a hearing in the open Court. What cannot be done directly cannot be permitted to be done indirectly. The court should not permit hearing of such an application for ""clarification"", ""modification"" or ""recall"" if the application is in substance a clever move for review. The application cannot be maintained and is rejected.","The petition is in essence and substance seeking for a review under the guise of making an application for clarification.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the Central  Administrative Tribunal,  Shimla Bench  made in O.A. No.619/95  and the  review order, The admitted position is that  the Director of Eduction issued a notice for Junior Basic Teachers’ Training. The criteria for selection was 100 marks  based  on  the  percentage  of  marks  based  on  the percentage  of   marks  obtained  in  matric  or  equivalent examinations, 20  marks for candidates belonging rural areas and 10  marks for candidates belonging to backward panchayat were  allotted.   Similarly,  10  marks  were  allotted  for candidates belonging  to IRDP families. Though the appellant claimed to  belong to  IRDP family, the authorities have not considered her claim and consequently did not award 10 marks as required under the criteria. When the appellant filed the writ petition,  the High  Court dismissed  the same  holding that the  appellant had  not produced  the certificate along with the  application and, therefore, she is not entitled to the above  status. When we directed the appellant to produce the record,  she made  the certificate a part of the record. Unfortunately it  does not  bear the  date of  issue; but we find that  she has  been given  serial number  of  the  IRDP family. In  view of the fact that serial are ascribed to all the candidates  in the  order, we  are of  the view that her failure  to   furnish  the   certificate  along   with   the application does  not disentitle her to claim the status for consideration of 10 marks. Pursuant to the interim direction granted by  this Court,  the appellant  has already appeared for the  examinations conducted  but her result has hot been announced. Therefore, the  appeals are  allowed; the  order of the Tribunal stands  set aside.  There shall  be a  direction to declare the  result and  her case  for appointment  will  be considered in accordance with the rules, if she is selected.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Special  Leave  Petition (Civil) No. 5775 of 1990. From  the  Judgment and Order dated  30.11.1989  of  the Allahabad High Court in C. Misc. W.P. No. 2431 of 1989. 737 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 Dr. L.M. Singhvi and Pramod Dayal for the Petitioners. T.S.  Krishnamoorthy  lyer and D.M.  Nargolkar  for  the Respondents. The following Order of the Court was delivered On the facts and circumstances of the case including the facts set out in the counter affidavit filed by R.B. Sahi we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the Allahabad High Court. Very  briefly stated respondent No. 1 is the owner of  a Petrol Pump which is set up on a site in Dehradun, of  which respondent  No. 1 is the lessee. The ’No Objection  Certifi- cate’  granted for conducting the said Petrol Pump.was  can- celled  by  respondent  No. 5, the  District  Magistiate  of Dehradun, and that order was upheld by the Commissioner. The Division  Bench of the Allahabad High Court by the  impugned judgment  set aside the order of the Commissioner. The  spe- cial leave petition is directed against the said order as we have already observed we see no reason to interfere with the actual order passed by the Division Bench but we would  like to make a clarification regarding the interpretation of Rule 151 of the Rules framed in 1976 under the Petroleum Act. Rule 144 of the said Rules deals with the issue of a ’No Objection  Certificate’  for  a new license  for  running  a Petrol Pump. Rule 151 deals with the cancellation of the ’No Objection Certificate’ and the said rule reads as follows: (1)  ""A  no objection certificate granted under  Rule  144 shall be liable to be cancelled by the District Authority or the State Government, if the District Authority or the State Government  is  satisfied, that the licensee has  ceased  to have any right to use the site for storing petrol;  Provided that  before  cancelling  a no  objection  certificate,  the licensee  shall be given a reasonable opportunity  of  being heard. (2) A District Authority or a State Government  cancelling a  no  objection  certificate shall record  in  writing  the reasons for such cancellation and shall immediately  furnish to the licen- 738 see and to the licensing authority concerned a  copy of the order cancelling the no objection certificate."" The  High Court has rightly observed that  the  District Authority under Rule 151 can cancel the No Objection Certif- icate only when the licensee ceases to have any fight to use the  site  for storing petrol. However,  there  are  certain subsequent  observations made by the High Court in  the  im- pugned  judgment  which might lead to an inference  that  so long as the licensee continues to have lease-hold rights  on the site, the ’No Objection Certificate’ cannot be cancelled at  all. That does not appear to be the correct position  in law.  On a reading of sub-rule (1) of Rule 151 it  is  clear that a ’No Objection Certificate’ granted under Rule 144 can be cancelled wherever the licensee ceases to have any  right to  use the site for storing petrol and that right could  be lost by a licensee either by his tenancy or right to the use of the site coming to an end or for any other reason  where- by,  in  law, the right to use the site for  storing  petrol ceases. In  view  of the clarification which we have  made,  Dr. Singhvi,  learned counsel for the petitioner states that  he does  not  wish  to press the petition.  The  Special  Leave petition is, therefore, dismissed. N.P.V.

This appeal by Special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 17.5.2000 passed by the learned Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi whereby the learned Division Bench upheld the order dated 11th January, 2000 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench. None appears for the appellant. The Tribunal has taken the view that since the respondent herein has been granted retrospective promotion from 27.8.1984 he must be paid arrears of pay and allowances for the higher post for the period 27th August, 1984 till 5th February, 1992. Aggrieved against the order of the  Tribunal dated 11th January, 2000 the Appellant herein filed a writ petition before the High Court and the High Court dismissed the writ petition affirming the order of the Tribunal. Hence the present appeal. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. It was argued by learned counsel for the respondent that when a retrospective promotion is given to an incumbent normally he is entitled to all benefits flowing therefrom. However, this Court in the case of State of Haryana & Ors. v. D.P. Gupta & Ors., [1996] 7 SCC 533 and followed in the case of A.K. Soumini v. State Bank of Travancore JT (2003) 8 SC 35 has taken the view that even in case of a notional promotion from retrospective date, it cannot entitle the employee to arrears of salary as the incumbent has not worked in the promotional post. These decisions relied on the principle of no work no pay. The learned Division Bench in the impugned judgment has placed reliance on the case of State of Andhra Pradesh v. K.V.L. Narasimha Rao & Ors., (1999) 3 SC 205. In our view, the High Court did not examine that case in detail. In fact, in the said judgment the view taken by the High Court of grant of salary was set aside by this Court. Therefore, we are of the view that in the light of the consistent view taken by this Court in the abovementioned cases, arrears of salary cannot be granted to the respondent in view of the principle of no work no pay in case of retrospective promotion. Consequently, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 17.5.2000 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court as also the order dated 11.1.2000 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principle Bench. The appeal is allowed. No order as to costs.",The appeal by Special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 17.5.2000 passed by the learned Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi.

" O R D E R Though hotices  have been  served, respondents  are not appearing either in person of through counsel. Leave granted. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short, the ‘Act’) was published on September 26, 1981  for public  purpose, namely,  establishment of Bus Depot/Stand in  Gadwal Town  of  Mehaboobnagar  District  in State of Andhra Pradesh. The Land Acquisition Officer in his award dated  December 27,  1983 awarded  compensation at the rate of Rs.8.000/- per. On reference, the Civil Court by its award and  decree dated  November  15,  1985,  enhanced  the compensation to  Rs.20/- per sq. yd. On appeal, the Division Bench of  the  A.P.  High  Court  in  Appeal  No.2391/86  by judgment and  decree dated  August 8, 1996 has confirmed the same. Thus, this appeal, by special leave. The High  Court has relied upon Ex.A-4 the sale wherein related to  a small piece of land, and accordingly confirmed the market  value @  Rs.20/- per  sq. yd.  It  is  now  well settled legal  position that  small pieces  of  land  cannot offer the  same market  value when  a large track of land is purchased in  an  open  market  by  a  willing  and  prudent purchased in  an  open  market  by  a  willing  and  prudent purchaser. It  is settled  legal position that the Court has to put itself in the armchair of a prudent purchaser and put the question  to itself  whether  the  land,  in  the  given circumstances, would  fetch the  same  market  value  as  is likely to  be determined  by the  court when  small piece of land would  be offered  for sale.  Unfortunately,  the  High Court  has   not  adopted  that  principle;  it  has  merely proceeded to  rely upon  sale deed relating to a small piece of land.  We have  gone through  the award of the Collector. The Collector  referred to various sale deeds and ultimately he relied upon a sale transaction and held that the lands in the sale  deed at Sl. No. 120, pertaining to survey Nos.854, which fetched  the rate of Rs.4,519-77 as on the date of the sale, namely, December 27, 1978 was comparable one. The Land Acquisition  Officer  noted  that  the  lands  therein  were converted into  non-agricultural  lands  and  the  lands  in question still  remained to  be agricultural  lands and were http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 adjacent to  Gadwal  Town.  Under  these  circumstances,  he awarded the  market value  at the rate of Rs.800/- per acre. It is  settled legal  position that  the burden  is  on  the claimant to prove by adducing acceptable evidence for higher compensation. Having  rejected  Ex.A-4  relied  on  by  High Court, though  the award  of Land Acquisition Officer is not evidence  stricto  sensu  with  a  view  to  do  substantial Justice. We  looked into  it  and  considered  the  material collected therein.  Having regard  to the  state of evidence and large  extent of  the land  in question  as also and the facts, we  think that  the appropriate market value would be Rs.20,000/- per  acre  and  would  be  just  and  reasonable compensation. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the reference Court as confirmed by the High Court is set aside. Instead, the  award shall  be substituted by Rs.20,000/- per acre with  usual solatium at the rate of 30% and interest on enhanced compensation  at the  rate of 9% per annum from the date of  taking possession  to the  date of  payment of such enhanced compensation and at the rate of 15% thereafter till deposit of  enhanced compensation  into the court. No orders as to costs.","Land Acquisition Officer in his award dated  December 27, 1983 awarded compensation at the rate of Rs.8.000/- per acre.

" D E R L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J Leave granted. Heard  Shri Ashok Kumar Panda, learned senior  counsel for  appellant  and Shri Jayant Das, learned senior  counsel for  respondent  Nos.  1 to 3, Shri S.B.  Upadhyay,  learned counsel  for  respondent Nos.  4 to 7, and  Shri  Janaranjan Das, learned counsel for respondent Nos.  8 to 11. Being  aggrieved  by  the  order  of  the  High  Court dismissing  the writ petition OJC No.4783, the appellant has filed  this appeal by special leave assailing the  judgment. The  Writ Petition was filed by the appellant seeking  issue of a writ of mandamus to the respondents  the Indira Gandhi Institute  of Technology (for short IGIT), Sarang, in  the State  of  Orissa  and the State Government for  framing  of specific  rules  governing  his   service  conditions;   for inclusion  of  his name in the common cadre  of  ministerial staff  in the category of cashier/senior assistant accepting him  as  a  ministerial   staff  /cashier  since  17.4.1986/ 1.7.1986;   for  his placement in the gradation list of  the cadre of senior assistants of the IGIT. The  High  Court,  on  consideration  of  the  matter, declined  to grant any reliefs to the appellant and disposed of  the writ petition with the observation we make it clear that  if in the meantime the petitioner has been regularised in  the post of cashier, it is open to him to make a further representation to allow him to continue in that post. The  main thrust of the arguments of Shri Ashok  Kumar Panda  learned  senior  counsel for the appellant  was  that though  the appellant was initially appointed in the post of assistant  cashier he was discharging the duties of cashier. Considering  the representation made by the appellant he was offered  the post of cashier with effect from 1.5.1989 which fact  is  reflected in the tentative gradation list  of  the ministerial   staff   as  on   1.6.1991  (Annexure  P   11). Subsequent  thereto the appellant was transferred as  senior http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 assistant  with effect from 11.7.1990/16.8.90 and since then he is holding the post of senior assistant.  Though the name of  the appellant has been included in the gradation list as a  member  of the ministerial staff of the  institution  his entry  into the present grade has been shown as on 16.8.1990 which  in  the  submissions  of  Shri  Panda  is  erroneous. According  to  Shri  Panda the posts of cashier  and  senior assistant  are interchangeable/inter-transferable posts, and they  carry  the same scale of pay.  Therefore, there is  no reason  why the service rendered by the appellant as cashier with  effect from 1.5.1989 when his appointment in that post was  regularised  should not be counted for the  purpose  of determination  of  seniority.  If the appellant is taken  to have made his entry in the present grade on 1.5.1989 then he will  become  senior  to respondents 4 to 7 herein  who  are placed  in the tentative gradation list at serial nos.  3 to 6 while the appellant is placed at serial no.7. On  perusal of the order under challenge we find  that the  High  Court  has  not considered the  question  of  the appellants  claim  of seniority on the basis  noted  above. From  the  discussions in the judgment it appears  that  the High  Court dismissed the writ petition mainly on the ground that the reliefs for issue of writ of mandamus directing the respondent  No.1 to formulate a policy and to prepare  rules regarding service conditions cannot be entertained in a writ petition.  The High Court observed: Though  the  petitioner had no right to the  post  of cashier at the time of initial appointment, but since he has been  regularised  at a subsequent stage, there","The Writ Petition was filed by the appellant seeking issue of a writ of mandamus to the respondents.

" JUDGMENT S.B. SINHA, J. Leave granted. The appellant’s father expired on 10.2.2001 while in office. In terms of the Rule, as it was existing then, the appellant was entitled to be appointed on compassionate grounds. An application for such an appointment was filed within two weeks by the appellant from the date of his father’s death. Not only the appellant was denied appointment in District Yamuna Nagar although his deceased father had been employed as a Kanungo in District Yamuna Nagar, when he was sought to be appointed in the District of Karnal, the same was denied to him by the District Magistrate, Karnal inter alia on the plea that there does not exist any vacancy. The appellant filed a writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Before the said Court, the respondents raised a contention that in the meanwhile the State of Haryana had issued a notification on 28.2.2003 known as ""the Haryana Compassionate Assistance to the Dependants of Deceased Government Employees Rules, 2003"". Rule 9 of the same reads as under: ""9.(a) Appointments under these Rules shall be made only on regular basis and that too only, if regular posts meant for that purpose are available. (b) Appointments under these rules can be made up to a maximum of 5% of sanctioned posts (falling under direct recruitment quota) in Group C & D categories to be determined by the Head of the Department on the 31st March of each year. The appointing authority may hold back upto 5% of posts in the aforesaid categories to be filled by direct recruitment through Staff Selection Commission or otherwise, so as to fill such posts by appointment on compassionate grounds. (c) A Person selected for appointment on ex-gratia basis shall be adjusted in the recruitment roster against the appropriate category viz. Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe/Backward Classes/General depending upon the category to which he/She belongs."" The High Court relaying on and on the basis of the said Rule dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant directing the respondents to make the payment of ex-gratia amount under the Rules. Appellant herein had sought for appointment on compassionate grounds at a point of time when 2003 Rules were not in existence. His case, therefore, was required to be considered in terms of the Rules Which were in existence in the in the year 2001. Evidently, in the State of Haryana a State wise list is maintained. In terms of the said list so maintained by the State of Haryana, the appellant was entitled to obtain an appointment on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 compassionate grounds. He was offered such an appointment by the State. It was the District Magistrate who came on the way and refused to provide for the post. The High Court unfortunately failed to consider this aspect of the matter. When a Statewise list is prepared, it does not lie in the mouth of a authority incharge, be it a District Magistrate or any other officer, to disobey the order passed by a higher Authority. Furthermore, there might not be any post available at Karnal but there cannot be any doubt or dispute that such a post would be available in some other district within the State of Haryana as otherwise such an appointment could not have been made. The appellant in his written statement has categorically stated that he is ready and willing to join anywhere in the State of Haryana. Before us the State has not filed any counter affidavit. The District Magistrate of Karnal has done so and before us also only the pleas which were raised before the High Court have been raised. For the reasons aforementioned, we are not inclined to accept the said pleas of respondent No. 4. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court. The Department of Personnel, State of Haryana is directed to issue an appointment letter posting the appellant to any post within the State of Haryana as per his original seniority within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order.","The appellant’s father expired on 10.2.2001 while in office.

" S. N. VARIAVA, J. L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J Leave granted. Heard parties. This  Appeal  is  against an Order dated  18th  January, 2000.  Breifly stated that facts are as follows : Respondent  No.  1 was employed by the Appellant Bank as a  Samiti  Sevak.  A show cause notice was issued to him  to explain certain financial irregularities and embezzlement of monies  by  not depositing loan amounts recovered  from  the members.  On receipt of the show cause notice Respondent No. 1  made good to the Bank the amounts.  Respondent No.  1 did not  reply  to  the  show cause  notice.   Services  of  the Respondent  No.   1  were,  therefore,  terminated  on  10th August,  1977.  Respondent No.  1 filed a suit under Section 55(2)  of  the  Madhya Pradesh Co-operative  Societies  Act, 1960,  for setting aside the order of dismissal.  Respondent No.   1  claimed  the reinstatement with  back  wages.   The Assistant Registrar held on evidence that the Respondent No. 1 was guilty of the conduct alleged.  However, the Assistant Registrar  noted  that  there  had been  no  inquiry  before services were terminated.  The Assistant Registrar therefore declared the dismissal as illegal and directed reinstatement but  without  back wages.  On Appeal by the  Appellants  the order of reinstatement without back wages was maintained. On  further  Appeal to the Board of Revenue it was  held that  the Respondent No.  1 was entitled to back wages.  The Writ  Petition filed by the Appellants was dismissed by  the impugned  order dated 18th January, 2000.  It was held  that once  it  was held that services were terminated  unlawfully then  as  a  necessary  consequence the  employee  would  be entitled to back wages. In  our view the Order passed by the Assistant Registrar http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was correct.  On facts it had been found that the Respondent No.   1  had  embezzled  certain monies.   The  monies  were returned  by him only after the show cause notice was issued to  him.   His termination was set aside only  on  technical grounds  inasmuch  as no inquiry was conducted.  Under  such circumstances  the  Assistant  Registrar correctly  did  not award  any back wages.  In our view, on facts of this  case, the  order  directing  payment  of   back  wages  cannot  be sustained. Accordingly  we maintain the order of reinstatement  but set aside that portion of the Order which directs payment of back wages. The  Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.  There shall be no Order as to costs. (D.P. MOHAPATRA) (S. N. VARIAVA) February 21, 2001.","Appeal is against an Order dated 18th January, 2000. Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.

The admitted facts are that the appellant had installed the video game consisting of a machine with a display screen which is activated only by inserting a coin in the slot made in the  machine. Immediately  thereon, the  screen is lit up and the  game commences.  The question is : whether it is an entertainment within  the meaning  of Section  2(a) of  U.P. Entertainment and  Betting Act. 1979 (for short, the ’Act’)? The appellant’s  own case  is that the operator gets nothing in return  other than the pleasure he derives or enjoys from exercising  or  building  up  his  skill  in  operating  the machine. The  Act defines  ""admission"" under  Section  2(a). Section   2(g)   defines   ""entertainment"".   Section   2(1) (iii),(iv)  and  (v)  in  particular  defines  ""Payment  for admission"" with  wide language.  Notification dated July 24, 1981 was  issued by  the State  exercising the  power  under Sections 3(1)  and 4(1) of the  Act prescribing the rates of admission. Admittedly, since  there  is  no  enumeration  in  this regard  for   the  video   game,  clause  (v)  of  the  said notification  imposes   30%  of   the   admission   fee   as entertainment tax.  The controversy  raised in  this case is squarely covered  by the  decision of  this Court  in  Geeta Enterprises &  Ors. vs.  State of  U.P. & Ors. [(1983) 3 SCR 812]. This Court has considered the above provisions and had held that  charge of  inserting the  coin was  realised only from  those who wanted to operate the video game at the rate of 50  paise. For  a slot  lasting upto  30 seconds  and  it http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 amounts to  entertainment within the meaning of Section 2(g) of the  Act. Therefore, video games is exigible to entertain tax. We, therefore, hold that the appellant is liable to pay the entertainment  tax. We do not find any illegality in the view taken by the High Court warranting interference. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.

" JUDGMENT 2002 (1) SCR 225 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The present appellants moved the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission alleging that the respondents had been guilty of deficiency in service in that they had, without good reason, frozen the sanctioned working facilities of the appellant without prior intimation. In this behalf, the appellant sought a direction to the first respondent to prepare a funding package to re-start the appellant’s oil division and to grant waiver of interest, damages in the sum of Rupees fifteen crores and an additional sum of Rupees sixty lakhs to cover cost of travelling, man days lost and other expenses incurred by the appellant in pursuing the matter with the respondents. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dismissed the complaint saying, ""The complaint is against the bank, whether the bank is entitled to reduce the loan facilities or not. We do not consider it to be a fit case to be tried under the Consumer Protection Act. The Original Petition is dismissed. However, the complainant is at liberty to go (to) the Civil Court or any other forum, if so advised."" Against this order of dismissal of the complaint, the appellant has filed this appeal and it has been referred to a Bench of three Judges because it was felt that the question raised was one of importance. Given the nature of the claim in the complaint and the prayer for damages in the sum of Rupees fifteen crores and for an additional sum of Rupees sixty lakhs for covering the cost of travelling and other expenses incurred by the appellant, is obvious that very detailed evidence would have to be led, both to prove the claim and thereafter to prove the damages and expenses. It is, therefore, in any event not an appropriate case to be heard and disposed of in a summary fashion. The National Commission was right in giving to the appellant liberty to move the Civil Court. This is on appropriate claim for a Civil Court to decide and, obviously, was not filed before a Civil Court to start with because, before the Consumer Forum, and figure in damages can be claimed without having to pay court fees. This, in that sense, is an abuse of the process of the Consumer Forum.

" O R D E R These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the Administrative  Tribunal  made  on  December  15,  1986. Admittedly thee  H.I.M. Ayurvedic  Degree College,  Paprola, District Kangra  was taken over by the Government and handed over to  the H.P.  Health  and  Family  Welfare  Department. Clause (3) of the agreement envisages as under: ""The service of the existing staff, principal, Teaching  Administrative and other employer on regular basis in  the   college  who  fulfil  the requisite  qualifications  and  age conditions may  be taken  over with effect  from   3.3.1978  after  due screening if  done by  a purpose by the Government  in which  2 members i.e. principal and Manager from the Managing Committee  shall  also  be included. Service  of  the  present employees   will    be    protected according to Government rules."" In accordance therewith, the existing staff, principal, teaching, administrative  and other  employees  employed  on regular basis in the college were eligible to be absorbed on regular  basis   provided  they   fulfilled  the   following conditions: (1)  they were appointed on regular basis in the college before taking over; (2) they possessed the requisite qualifications  prescribed  for  the  posts;  and  (3)  they fulfilled the  age condition  at the  time  of  taking  over w.e.f.  March   3,  1978.   On  fulfillment   of  all  these conditions, they  would be  sent to  a  screening  committee constituted for  the purpose by the Government including two members, i.e.,  the Principal  and Manager  of the  Managing Committee  to  represent  the  employees  in  the  screening committee. On  recommendation made  by  the  Committee,  the regular absorption could be made. Unfortunately,  the   appellants  were   not  regularly appointed; nor did they possess the requisite qualifications for absorption  on regular basis in the posts as on the date of the  take over. Resultantly, instead of throwing them out http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of service  by retrenchment,  the Governor  issued the order exercising the  power under  proviso to  Article 309  of the Constitution on  May  24,  1980  in  consultation  with  the Himachal Pradesh  Public Service  Commission and  Rules  for Recruitment  and   Promotion  of   the   Ayurvedic   College employees,  Paprola,   District  Kangra.   Admittedly,   the appellant even  then did  not satisfy  those  qualifications proscribed under  the Rules. Resultantly, they were absorbed in suitable administrative posts to which they are eligible. When they  challenged their  absorption, the Tribunal in the impugned order  directed to  maintain the scale of pay which they were  drawing on the date of the take over and directed their  absorption   in  the   posts  of  Ayurvedic  Chikitsa Adhikaris etc. Thus, these appeals by special leave. It is  seen that  since the appellant had not fulfilled the requisite qualifications either when they were initially appointed  by  the  committee  before  take  over  nor  when statutory rules  were made  by the  Governor so as to enable for absorption.  Instead of  retrenching them  from services due to  nonfulfillment came  to absorb them in the Ayurvedic Chikitsa Adhikaris  posts etc.  to which  they are eligible. The Tribunal  has given  the direction  to maintain the pay- scales and  to make  adjustment and  absorption. In our view directions are  correct and  based on equity and do not call for any  interference.  They  may  also  be  considered  for further promotion from the absorbed posts in accordance with the rules. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. No costs.","H.I.M.

" JUDGMENT 1994(3) SCR 899 The following Order of the Court was delivered : We need not dilate upon the previous history of this case. Suffice to state that on April 6,1994 when the appeals had come up for hearing, this Court directed the respondents to produce the record and also a responsible officer to file an affidavit whether the disputed land is still needed for a public purpose being a suitable one or there is no other better land available to establish taluk office at Thiruvaiyaru. Pursuant thereto, an affidavit had been filed by one G.V. Suresh, R.D.O., Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu in which it is stated that the Government had proposed to open a sub- treasury at Thiruvaiyaru. In view of the fact that Sub-Taluk was elevated to the status of regular Taluk they needed larger buildings, there being congestion in the existing building and the Commissioner for Land Revenue along with the District Collector and other officers, when inspected different lands and identified the present lands as suitable for Taluk office and sub-treasury office. Accordingly the proceedings for acquisition, it is stated, were initiated. In the record produced, a plan is available. From that plan it would appear that the existing Taluk Office is situated on the west of the main road and to the east of the main road, apart from the built-up-town, there are large open areas available for acquisition. The land in question admit-tedly, is situated at a place far away from the place where Taluk Office is found and is in a deviation road leading to Kumbhakonam. It is also stated by the appellants that to the north of this area an extent of 18 acres of land is still available for acquisition. From the report of the Commissioner for Land Revenue, it becomes clear that initially a proposal was made to acquire 20 acres of land as a compact block to establish Raja’s College of Music with all attended facilities and 5 acres of land for establishing taluk office, sub-treasury office, sub- jail etc. It would appear that the lands needed for the construction of the music college are no longer needed. It becomes also clear that in the present land there is a well developed coconut tope, paddy and sugarcane fields. They are situated at lower level than the road by 2 to 3 feet. We do not propose to go into the controversy whether the proceedings to acquire land for Music college were pursued or dropped as being unnecessary for the purpose of this case. The Commissioner appears to have been persuaded with the idea of the Collector to acquire the entire land for putting up a compact block and their extensions of Raja College of Music with attached facilities etc. In view of the fact that major part of the proposal appears to have not been pursued, the proposal to have a compact block on longer subsists. Con- sidered from this perspective and in view of the fact that on the main road http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 there are other agricultural open lands available for acquisition either to the north or to the south of the taluk office abutting the main road, we find that there would be no justification for proceeding with the acquisition of the lands in question. The Notification issued and published on 23rd July, 1981 is accordingly quashed, as regards the lands in question. It is needless to mention that it is open to the authorities to acquire any other lands suited for the purpose of establishing the regular taluk office and other offices. The appeals are allowed. In the circumstances, the parties are directed to bear their own cost,","The Court quashed the notification issued and published on 23rd July, 1981, as regards the lands in question.

" ORDER 1.   Delay condoned.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. 2.   Leave granted. 3.   This appeal arises from the order dated April 12,  1993 passed by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal,  Bhubaneshwar, in T.A.No.50/90. Admittedly, the respondent was appointed as Director  of Fisheries on August 12, 1971, on ad-hoc  basis. Thereafter, by order dated July 22, 1972, he was directed to continue temporarily until further orders.  It would  appear that the government had taken policy decision to appoint  an I.A.S.  officer to man the post of the Director,  Fisheries. By  Notification  dated March 18, 1977, the  Government  has reverted  the  respondent from the post of Director  to  the post  of  Joint Director.  The  respondent  had  voluntarily retired  from service on 16.12.77. The only  controversy  is whether the reversion of the respondent is valid in law.  It is  pointed  out  by Mr.J.R.Das,  learned  counsel  for  the respondent,   that  the  respondent  was   appointed   after consultation and with the concurrence of the Public  Service Commission.  Therefore, his appointment must be deemed to be a  regular  appointment.   Thereby  without  conducting   an enquiry and an opportunity for misconduct, the reversion  of the  respondent to the post of Joint Director,  is  illegal. We find no force in the submisSion. 4.   Admittedly,  there  is  no order  communicated  to  the respondent  appointing  him  in a  substantive  capacity  as Director.   The only order passed in his favour was of  July 22,  1972.  That order clearly shows that he would  continue temporarily  until further orders in terms of the  order  of appointment  made  on ad-hoc basis on August 12,  1971.   In other  words,  mere prolonged of continuous  ad-hoc  service does not ripen into a regular service to claim permanent  or substantive  status.  He would remain to be on ad-hoc  basis until further orders.  Since the government had taken policy decision  to appoint an I.A.S., he was rightly  reverted  to the  post of Joint Director.  Accordingly, we hold that  his http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reversion is perfectly legal and valid.  However, the  stark facts  remain that he continued in the post of Director  and discharged his duties as Director from August 12, 1971.   In these circumstances, as a mark of good gesture but not as  a precedent,   the  appellants  are  directed  to   give   him pensionary  benefits computing his pay as if he  voluntarily retired  as  a  Director from December 16,  1977.   All  the proceedings now stand concluded.  The T.A. stands dismissed. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.  No costs. 56","This appeal arises from the order dated April 12, 1993 passed by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal, Bhubaneshwar, in T.A.No.50/90.

O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R Leave granted. The High  Court, after  hearing arguments in Civil Writ Petition filed  by the respondents held that since the Award had not  been made  within  the  period  stipulated  by  the statute   (Section   11A),   the   notification   concerning acquisition of Khasra Nos. 127 and 173 had to be declared to be of  no effect  and after  making that order, released the two Khasra  numbers from  the acquisition notifications vide order dated  22.8.1996. This  appeal  calls  that  order  in question. The attention  of the  High Court had been drown to the stay order  dated 25.4.1985,  whereby during the pendency of the Writ  Petition, the dispossession of the petitioners had been stayed   by  the High  Court to  urge that  the  period during which  the stay  order was  in operation  had  to  be excluded for  computing the  prescribed period under Section 11A of  the Act.  According to  the High Court , however the order  dated   25.4.1985  concerned   only   the   stay   of dispossession of  the writ  petitioners and it could not, in any way  be  interpreted  to  imply  stay    of  acquisition proceedings. The  approach of  the High  Court is erroneous. This question  is no  longer res-integra.  In Government  of Tamil Nadu  & Anr. vs. Vasantha Bai ( 1995 (Supp.) 2 SCC 423 ), a Bench of this Court has held that the stay order of the type that  was granted  in the  instant case, tantamounts to stay of  further proceedings  being taken  and therefore the entire period  during which  the stay order was in operation was to  be excluded  while computing the period of two years prescribed for  making an  Award under  Section 11A the Act. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The view  taken  by  the  High  Court,  is,  therefore,  not sustainable. We, however,  find that  the High  Court has  not dealt with the  merits  of  the  writ  petition  and  quashed  the notification on  an erroneous  interpretation  of  the  stay order.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) NOS. 16894-16895/2007) Leave granted.

From the  Judgment and  Decree dated 14th October, 1966 of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeal No. 441/66. G. N.  Dikshit, M.  V. Goswami  and O.  P. Rana for the Appellant. B. Datta for the Respondent. 132 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by UNTWALIA, J.  This is  an appeal  by  certificate.  The Allahabad  High   Court  decided   that  the   date  of  the communication of  the order  will be  the starting  point of limitation for filing an appeal under Section 15 of the U.P. Motor Vehicles Taxation Act. The respondent wanted exemption of tax in respect of his motor vehicle for a certain period. He applied  to  the  Taxation  Officer,  Kanpur.  The  order rejecting his  prayer was  communicated  in  the  letter  of Taxation Officer  dated  October  20/24,  1964  through  the Regional  Transport   Authority,  Kanpur.   The   respondent received that  letter on  October 29,  1964. His  appeal was within 30  days of  October 29,  1964 but  beyond 30 days of October 24,  1964. If  October 24, 1964 could be taken to be the date  of the  order then obviously the appeal was out of time. If,  however, the  date of  the order in Section 15 of the U.P.  Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, in the context, meant the date  of the communication of the order, then the appeal was within  time. Following  the decision  of this  Court in Raja Harish Chandra Raj Singh v. The Deputy Land Acquisition Officer &  Another,(1) the  High Court has held in favour of the respondent hence this appeal. In our opinion, the judgment of the High Court is right and cannot  be interfered with by this Court. Apart from the reasons given  by this  Court in the earlier judgment to the effect that  the order must be made known either directly or constructively to  the party  affected by the order in order to enable  him to  prefer an  appeal if  he so likes, we may give one more reason in our judgment and that is this: It is plain that  mere writing  an order  in the  file kept in the office of the Taxation Officer is no order in the eye of law in the sense of affecting the rights of the parties for whom the order  is meant.  The order  must be communicated either directly or  constructively in the sense of making it known, which may make it possible for the authority to say that the party affected  must be deemed to have known the order. in a given case,  the date  of putting the order in communication under certain  circumstances may  be taken to be the date of the communication  of the order or the date of the order but ordinarily  and  generally  speaking,  the  order  would  be effective against  the person  affected by  it only  when it comes to  his knowledge  either directly  or constructively, otherwise not.  On the  facts stated  in the judgment of the High Court,  it is clear that the respondent had no means to know about  the order  of the Taxation Officer rejecting his prayer until  and unless  he received  his letter on October 29, 1964. Within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.P. Motor Vehicles Taxation Act that was the date of the order 133 which gave  the starting  point  for  preferring  an  appeal within 30 days of that date. For the  reasons stated above, we hold that there is no substance in this appeal. It is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances without costs. P.B.R.

" O R D E R The  two  appellants  before  us  in  these  respective appeals are Lipton India Ltd. and Brook Bond India Ltd., two well-known companies  dealing in  tea. Somewhere in the year 1968, these  companies were  in doubt  as to  whether  their upkeep of  godowns would  bring them within the ambit of the Bombay Shops  and Establishments  Act, 1948, in the presence of only  one salesman  opening and  closing the  Godown  for taking out  and putting  in tea  packets. The modus operandi suggested by the companies was that tea was stocked in those godowns/depots and  a salesman appointed would take out tea, load it  on a push-cart, manually operated by a labourer and sales offered in the market from door to door. At the end of the day,  the remainder  is brought  back  and  put  in  the godown/depot. On  these facts, opinion of the Government was sought by  the companies  whether they were required to have their establishments  registered under Section 7 of the Act. They were  told that  they had  to, on  the failure of which prosecution  would   be  launched.   And  as   we  are  told prosecutions were launched. The  twin   challenge  of   the   appellants   to   the constitutional  validity   of  the  notification  supposedly bringing them  within the  ambit of  the Act and the State’s view of the matter on the limited activity of the saleman in his godown/depot, a pattern adopted through out the country, failed before  the High  Court in writ proceedings which has given rise to these appeals. From the  lengthy pleadings  of  the  parties  and  the discussion made  by the  High Court, we would be required to put at  rest the  legal consequences of the limited activity of the  salesman. As  is plain,  the days  of push-carts and their being  operated manually  by a  labourer are over. The prosecution of  the companies  is also stale as nearly three decades are  about to  go by. There was a stay operating, as granted by  this Court. In these circumstances, Mr. Dholkia, learned senior  counsel appearing  for the  State,  is  fair http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 enough to  state that  the companies would not be prosecuted for the  alleged lapses  in not  having their establishments registered under  Section 7  of the  Act. In  view  of  this stance, Mr.  Pai, learned  senior counsel,  states that  the pleaded fact situation does not warrant that there should be a pronouncement as it is part of the past; mobility of goods now being  otherwise than  by push-carts.  In  view  of  the respective stances  adopted, we  close  these  matters.  The appeals shall  be taken to have been disposed of. It is made clear  that  should  the  present  modues  operandi  of  the appellants still  requires registration  under Section  7 of the Act,  they would  be obliged to do so, on the failure of which they would attract prosecutions.

" O R D E R A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act was published  in the State Gazette of Punjab on October 26, 1971 acquiring  70 Canals 48 Marlas of land for establishing a Mandi  (Market). The Land Acquisition Officer in his award dated February  18, 1972  classified  the  land  into  three categories and  determined the compensation at Rs.40,000/- & 10,000/- per acre respectively. On reference under s.18, the Additional District Judge in his award and decree dated June 3, 1976 classified the land into 5 categories and determined the compensation  at  the  rate  of  Rs.65,000/-,  50,000/-, 25,000/-,20,000/-and   15,000/-   per   acre   respectively. Dissatisfied therewith,the  claimants filled the appeal. The learned single  Judge by  his  judgement  and  decree  dated August 31,  1979 determined  the compensation at a flat rate of Rs.70,000/-  per acre  of the  entire land.  The  learned single Judge  has noted in the judgment that the counsel for the State  and the  claimants have  agreed  that  the  point raised in  the appeal  was squarely covered by a decision of that court  in   State of  Punjab v. Chand Singh, R.F.A. No. 1413/77 dated  August 23, 1979. Following that judgement the state’s appeal  as well  as the  claimants’ cross objections were disposed  of accordingly.  The Division Bench dismissed the appeal. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It is  rather unfortunate  that nothing has been placed on record  whether the State has carried the decision of the Division Bench in Chand Singh’s case in appeal to this court and if  so what  was its result. Further, even that judgment has not been made part of record. Therefore, we are not in a position to  know on  what principle  the learned  Judge had granted a  flat rate  to the  entire land.  But in this case since the claimants as well as well as the State relied upon the said  judgment and requested the Court to dispose of the matter in  terms thereof, without any material on record, it will be  difficult  for  this  Court  to  find  whether  the determination of  Rs. 70,000/-  per acre  and at a flat rate http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was proper  compensation. Accordingly  we are constrained to dismiss the appeal for the aforesaid reasons. No costs.

" O R D E R Leave  granted.  Heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the parties. We are unable to sustain the impugned order of the High Court quashing  the F.I.R.  lodged against  the  respondents alleging commission  of offences  under Sections 467 and 468 I.P.C. by  Chem in course of the proceeding of a civil suit, on  the  ground  that  Section  195  (1)  (b)  (ii)  Cr.P.C. prohibited entertainment  of and investigation into the same by the  police. From  a plain reading of Section 195 Cr.P.C. it is  manifest that  it comes  into operation  at the stage when the  Court intends  to take  cognizance of  an  offence under Section 190(1) Cr. P.C.; and it has nothing to do with the statutory  power of  the police  to investigate  into an F.I.R. which  discloses a  cognisable offence, in accordance with Chapter  XII of the Code even if the offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in Court.  In other words, the statutory power of the Police to investigate  under the  Code is not in any way controlled or circumscribed by Section 195 Cr.P.C. It is of course true that upon  the charge-sheet  (challan),  if  any,  filed  on completion of  the investigation  into such  an offence  the Court would  not be  competent to take cognizance thereof in view of  the embargo  of Section  19591) (b) Cr.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the High  Court of  Madhya Pradesh,  Jabalpur Bench, made on April  11,   1996  in   M.A  No.  414/96.  Respondent  No.2, Shivshankar Shukla was the owner of the land from khasra No. 336, Peesajhodi, Tehsil in District Betul. The said property was acquired  and an  award came to be made under section 16 of the  Indian  Forest  Act  By  the  Forest  Superintending officer. In  lieu of  compensation, the land to an extent of 4.50 acres of Khasra No. 282/1 and 292 was given to them . That  award  became  final.  After  taking  over  possession thereof, the  standing timbers(bamboos)  were  removed.  The respondents  filed   Civil  Suit   No.  4A  of  1988  for  a declaration of  title to  the land in khasra No. 336 and for compensation  of   Rs.39,000/-,  After  filing  the  written statement  contesting   the  suit,   Narendra   Kumar,   the Conservator of  Forest, the  third respondent  colluded with the respondents  1 and  2 with out any sanction of the State Government and  appears to have suffered a compromise decree in  that   suit,  The   additional  District  judge,  Betul, accordingly, passed  a decree  on May  8, 1992 setting aside the award. After one and a half years, the respondents filed an execution  application upon  which the appellants came to know of  the decree  for the  first time. Consequently, They filed an application under Section 47, CPC, objection to the execution on  the  ground  of  fraud.  The  application  was dismissed. The  writ petition  filed by  the appellants  was dismissed by  the High  Court with  liberty to agitate their right in  an appropriate  suit. Consequently,  the suit  was filed for  declaration and  to set  aside the  decree on the ground of collusion and fraud played upon the Government. Along with  the suit, an application under order XXXIX, Rule 1  and  2,  CPC  came  to  be  filed.  The  application  for injunction was  dismissed  and  the  appeal  has  also  been dismissed by  the High  Court. Thus,  this appeal by special leave. From the  above narration of the facts, it is seen that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 there was  a valid  award passed under the provisions of the Forest Act  and  the  award  came  to  be  set  aside  on  a compromise but  third respondent  though having no authority from the State Government . It is the admitted position that when the  first suit  was filed  by them,  the State  was in possession of  the property.  On that  premise, they  sought damages against  the State.  Under these circumstances, when the State  is agitating the right on the ground of fraud and collusion, it  is obvious that, pending suit, the appellants were entitled  to an  injunction restraining the respondents from    getting  the  fraudulent  decree  passed  against  , executed. Under these  circumstances, the  trial Court as well as the High  court has  committed manifest  error of law in not granting the injunction. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the High Court  and also  of the  civil Courts  stand set aside. There should  be an  interim injunction  pending  suit.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION  :  Special  Leave   Petition (Civil) No. 5097 of 1977. From  the Judgment and Order dated 24-9-75 of  the  Calcutta High Court in Appeal No. 154 of 1971. N. R. Chatterjee and Amlan Ghose for the Petitioner. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.-We have heard counsel Mr. Chatterjee on two http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 grievances  of  his  clinet.  According  to  him,  the  land belongs  to the petitioner, the huts belong to his  tenants, but the municipal assessment is based upon valuation of  the land and the huts together.  This grieVance is taken care of in two ways.  The High Court had directed that in regard  to each  bit  of land and hut thereon, there  win  be  particu- larisation of the assessment separately on the  consolidated valuation.   Secondly. there is also provision in s. 202  of the Calcutta, Municipal 607 Act,  1951  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  ’Act’)  for collection  by the owner of the land of so such of the  rate as is attributable to the hut which belongs not to the owner but  to the tenant, if we may put it loosely that way.   The details  have  been  spelt out in s. 202 of  the  Act.   ’We consider s. 202 as more or less a self-contained code  with the result that what is leviable under that provision cannot be prejudiced by the existence of any other provision. Counsel’s  second  grievence is that the provisions  of  the Thika  Tenancy  Act  stand  in the  way  of  the  petitioner collecting from his tenant any amount in excess of the  rent fixed  under the Act.  This grievance also has no  substance because the Thika Tenancy Act deals with rents while s.  202 deals with rates.  The special provision must prevail so far as  the rates are, concerned and the petitioner is not  pre- vented from collecting sums due under s. 202 in the shape of rates.   The Thika Tenancy Act does not come in the  way  of the  petitioner in recovering what is permissible  under  s. 202 of the Act. Nor are we able to appreciate counsel’s contention that  Art 14  of the Constitution is violated.  Bastis-horrid  hovels, which  blot the human-scape of India, still survive  in  our socialistic pattern-stand as a separate category although as an ugly but inescapable social reality.  It is true that the most  unfortunate  section of the society in  Calcutta  City dwell in these bastis except those who, unable to afford the luxury  even  of these bastis, have to seek shelter  on  the pavements.   So far as Art. 14 is concerned, the bastis  and the  dwellers of bastis stand in a tearfully separate  class by themselves and a special provision dealing with owners of bastis cannot be challenged as discriminatory. If ever there were  any discrimination it is against the human  condition, rather  the inhuman condition, of these whom dire  necessity drives to  occupy these hutments.  So far as the owners  are concerned  their position is protected by s. 202  and  there cannot be any complaint except abstract,theoretical and imaginary  ones, that there is discrimination against  them. With these observations, the petition is dismissed. S.R.                            Petition dismissed. 608",Petitioner says that the land belongs to him and the huts belong to his tenants.

The admitted position is that the first  respondent had entered into an agreement on March 11,1983 to  puchase  3  acres  28  gunthas  of  land  for  a consideration of  Rs.12,000/- and  he had  paid Rs.2000/- as earnest money.  The petitioner-second defendant puchased the self-same property  on july  8, 1983  for a consideration of Rs.6000/- and  had  the  sale  deed  registered.  The  first respondent filed  the suit  for  specific  performance.  The trial Court  finding that  the petitoner  had purchased  the property and  it would  cause irreparable  damage to  him if decree for  specific performance being would be granted, had derected refund  of the  earnest money  with  interest.  The first respondent carried the matter in appeal. The appellate Court set aside the decree of the trial Court on the finding that the  petitioner had not pleaded that he was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the prior agreement of sale. It  also had  held that  the refusal to grant rlief of specific performance  on that  ground was  not valid in law. Accordingly, it  reversed the  decree of the trial Court and granted specific performance. In the second appeal, the High Court while upholding the pleading of the respondent that he was ready  and willing  to perform his part of the agreement and that  he had  led the  evidence in that behalf, remitted the matter  to the  district Court  to frame an issue on the basis of  a previous  judgment and  the issue in this behalf was required  to  be  settled.  We  need  not  go  into  the correctness of  the remand  order since the first respondent has not  filed any  SLP against  that order.  Suffice it  to state that the petitioner has no cause for grievance in this matter for remanding the matter. In view of the finding that he is  a subsequent  purchaser, as  found by the trial Court itself, and  that the  High Court has remitted the matter to frame the  issue whether  the first respondent was ready and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 willing to  perform his  part of the contract and decide the matter on the basis of the evidence already on record, we do not think  that there  is any  error of law committed by the High Court in remitting the matter.

The said application has been resisted by the contesting respondents inter alia on the ground that Dr. Dhunjibhoy is not senior enough for being appointed as a Joint Administrator and her appointment may cause administrative problems as there are more than 30 of the consultants working in the hospital, senior to her. 5.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Delay condoned. Though the respondent has been served, none appears for the  respondent.   The  respondent   filed  writ:   petition questioning the competence of the Government to levy cess on mining lease.  Learned single  Judge by  his judgment  dated October 1,  1986 allowed  the writ  petition. The Government amended the  District Boards Act, 1955 by Amendment Act 8 of 1989 empowering  the State  to levy land revenue or royalty/ seigiorage fee.  The respondent  again filed  writ  petition No.1  of   1987  questioning   the  legislative   competence following the  judgment of  this Court  in India Cement Ltd. vs. State  of Tamil  Nadu [(1990) 1 SCC 12]. By judgment and order dated  December 21, 1989, the High Court held that the amendment  was   ultra  vires   the  power   of  the   State Legislature.  Again   the  legislature   amended   the   Act empowering the  levy and  collection of the cess on the same grounds,  while   appeal  was   filed  in  this  Court.  The respondent filed  another writ petition which was allowed by the High  Court on  December 21,  1990. Thus, this appeal by special leave. The controversy is no longer res integra. This Court in P.Kannadasan  etc.etc.  vs.  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  &  Ors. etc.etc. [C.A.  No. 9847/96 & batch] decided on July 6, 1996 has considered  elaborately the  entire controversy and held that the  legislature is competent to amend the law removing the invalidity  pointed out in the judgment. Therefore, when an Act  made by  the State Legislature is invalidated by the Court on  the ground  that the legislature was not competent to enact  it, the  legislature is  competent to  remove  the lacuna and  alter the  basis of the judgment, as pointed out by  the  Court,  and  enact  the  law  consistent  with  the constitutional scheme.  The contention  that the  Parliament must first  create the  levy and  then give it retrospective effect was also negatived holding that the Parliament is not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 bound to  adopt identical  language every  time it  enacts a validation Act.  It is open to it to employ such language as it chooses.  All that  the Court  should see  is whether the language employed  achieves the purpose which the Parliament sets out  to achieve.  The language employed in Section 2 of the validation  Act does  achieve the  purpose. Dealing with the further  contention that the validation was designed to, and provides  only to  validate the taxes and cesses already covered under the relevant provisions of the enactment which was declared  invalid and  that power  cannot be utilised to empower or  authorise the  Parliament to  recover taxes  and cesses payable  under the invalid provisions, this Court had held that  unless the  levy is validated, recoveries already made cannot  be validated.  It was  for this reason that the enactment came  to be  made. A  Further contention  that the Parliament is  devoid of  the power  to prescribe  different rates of  tax in different States as it violates Article 14. That  contention   was  also   elaborately  considered   and negatived by  this Court.  Yet another  contention that  the Parliament having denuded the power of the State Legislature to levy tax mineral extraction was raised and royalties is invalid unless a fresh enactant under Entry 54 of the List I of the  Seventh Schedule  is made.  That contention also was rejected. It  is, thus, clear that this Court has upheld the amendments validating  the collections  of the  cess payable under the State Acts. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  judgments and orders of  the High  Court stand  set aside. No costs, since the respondent is not appearing.","The Government amended the District Boards Act, 1955 by Amendment Act 8 of 1989 empowering the State to levy land revenue or royalty/ seigiorage fee.

" O R D E R Pursuant to the direction issued by this Court on April 12, 1996  in J.P  Ravidas &  Ors. vs Navyavak Haruan Uthapan Multi Unit  Industrial Cooperative  Societies  Ltd.  &  Ors. [(1996) 9 SCC 800], the registrar of the cooperative society made an  enquiry into  the eligibility of the person to whom the  allotments   have  been   made  by   the   builder   in contravention of  the  original  directions  issued  by  the Government  while  allotting  the  Government  land.  It  is clearly established  from the  report that  the builder  has grossly violated  the regulation  of  allotment of the flats to the  non-Delit members. This ultimate finding recorded by the Registrar  is that  40  non-dalit  members  are  in  the possession of  the flats  contrary  to  the  regulation  and accordingly he  directed the  Administrator to  eject  those person and  allot  these  flats  to  the  Dalit  members  in accordance therewith.  We find  that the  report is correct. According to  Shri Harish  Salve, learned  counsel  for  the employees of  the Municipal Corporation they are entitled to allotment of  the flats  in the  building constructed by the society. The  Registrar is  not right  in  cancelling  these allotments. Shri  R.S. Masodkar,  learned  counsel  for  the State, in  fairness, has  stated that  the view taken by the Registrar is  not correct  to the  reservation  as  per  the Regulation. It  should be determined by the Registrar and to that  extent   the  allotment   made  to  the  Corporation’s employees is  directed to  be regularised.  This is  out  of general category.  The 40  non-dalits allotees  will go.  As regards the  Dalit members, the direction given is perfectly valid and warrants no interference. An application  for clarification has been filed by the Society stating  that the management has not handed over the possession of  the flats  to  the  appellants:  instead  the administrator has been appointed. In view  of these  facts and  circumstances, we  direct that the  administrator should  take necessary steps to have all these  40 persons  named in  the report of the registrar ejected. 40  Dalit eligible  members should  be admitted and flats allotted  to them . Thereafter, he is directed to hand over the  management to  the Navyuvak  Harijan Uchapan Multi http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Unit  Industrial   Coop.   Society.   The   application   is accordingly disposed of. The Registrar of the Cooperative Society is directed to oversee the  actions taken  by the Administrator in ejecting the person  in possession in alloting 40 flats to the Dalits members; in   collecting  the amount from them handling over the amount  to the  non-dalits who are dispossessed from the building.","The builder has grossly violated the regulation of allotment of the flats to the  non-Delit members.

The appellants somehow engaged a lawyer to represent them before the Sessions Court, Budgam, but, he also failed to represent them.  In spite of the fact that the appellants were not represented, the Sessions Judge, Budgam, recorded the examination-in-chief of one of the witnesses.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION:  Civil  Appeal  No.  424 1971. Appeal  from the Judgment and Order dated the  22-2-1971 of Madras High Court in W.P. No. 3125 of 1970. M.  Natesan, and (Mrs). S. Gopalakrishanan, for  the  Appel- lant. K.S. Ramamurthi, A. T.M. Sampath, M.M.L. Srivastava  and E.C.Agarwala, for Respondent No. 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.--This  appeal,  without  any merit, deserves to be dismissed without much ado. The few facts of the case are that the appellant and the respondent, both operators Of stage carriages, applied for a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 permit on an 86 Km. route.  Marks were awarded to both under the  relevant Motor Vehicles Rules to settle their  compara- tive  merit.  The appellant secured 8.79 marks and  the  re- spondent 12.08.  The latter thus secured an easy  arithmeti- cal  victory  over the former and the sense  of  the  scheme would have ordinarily led to the award of the permit to  the respondent.  However, the Road Transport Authority preferred the  candidate  with the lesser marks on  the  compassionate ground that the rival with the larger marks had already  got a permit a couple of months before, on an overlapping  route of 53 Km.  On appeal, the Appellate Tribunal set aside  this award  and  granted 10--1546 SCI/76 408 the  permit  to the one who had more merit.  This  has  been affirmed  throughout, repelling the challenge by writ  peti- tion.   The  aggrieved appellant contends  that  his  permit should  not have been set aside, the ground being  that  the respondent had got an earlier permit on a part of the route. We are not persuaded about this ground being good. Permits  cannot be equated with distribution of  patron- age.  We must remember that public interest is at stake when public  transport services are operated.  The scheme of  the statute,  viz.,  the Motor Vehicles Act is that he  who  can serve  the  travelling public best, is to be chosen  as  the permit holder.  Considerations of grace, charity and compas- sion  at  the expense of  public  interest  are  an  act  of unfairness  to the Act.  The conclusion, therefore  is  that the appellant’s claim was rightly rejected and the  respond- ent’s award was rightly made. We  dismiss  the  appeal but in  the  circumstances  without costs.

" J U D G M E N T BHAN, J. Plaintiff/appellant (hereinafter referred to as ""the Appellant"") entered into a registered agreement to sell the land measuring 3.40  acres on 8.4.1986 with the defendant/respondents (hereinafter referred to as ""respondents"") .  Two suits were filed in the Trial Court.  Suit No. 139 of 1987 was filed by the appellant for cancellation of the written agreement dated 8.4.1986 with the averment that the appellant was Bhumidhar in possession of the disputed plots mentioned in the plaint, defendant Nos. 1 and 2 were money lenders and defendant No. 3 was their servant (who has not been impleaded as party in the civil appeal).  Appellant needed Rs. 1000/-.  Defendant No. 3 took the appellant to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 who declined to advance the loan of Rs. 1000/- on a promissory note and insisted to advance the loan through a registered document.  Appellant agreed to execute the registered agreement to secure the loan and went to the office of the Sub-Registrar along with the defendants on 8.4.1986. Agreement was prepared and typed on the stamp paper and signatures of the appellant were obtained and he was advanced a sum of Rs. 1000/- as loan. The agreement was registered on the same day.  The appellant wanted to repay the loan but when the respondents did not accept the same he got suspicious about their intention.  He made enquiries and came to know that a fraud was practised on him by respondents who fraudulently got executed the agreement to sell instead of the document to secure the loan of Rs. 1000/-.  Suit was filed for the cancellation of the agreement to sell.   Suit No. 425 of 1987 was filed by the respondents for specific performance of agreement to sell with the averment that  the appellant had agreed to transfer the suit land for Rs. one lakh out of which Rs. 30,000/- was paid to him as earnest money.  According to the terms of the agreement the appellant was to execute the sale deed within 11 months after obtaining permission from the Consolidation Officer.  As appellant refused to execute the sale deed the suit was filed for specific performance of the agreement.  Both the suits were contested. The Trial Court dismissed the suit filed by the appellant for cancellation of the agreement and decreed the suit filed by the respondents for specific performance.   Appellant filed an appeal against the order passed in suit No. 425 of 1987 which was dismissed by the first Appellate Court. Aggrieved against which the appellant filed second appeal which has been dismissed by the impugned order. The High Court on re-appreciation of the entire evidence came to the same conclusion as that of   the courts below.  Counsel for the appellant failed to point out any error in the findings recorded by the courts below. The only contention raised by him is that the agreement was unconscionable as the price of land at the time of the alleged agreement to sell was more than 20 lakhs and the appellant is being deprived of his valuable land for a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 petty amount.  On perusal of the written statement filed by the appellant in the Trial Court we find that no such plea was raised in the written statement. No issue was framed.  No evidence was led by the appellant to prove that the market price of the land was Rs. 20 lakhs as argued before us.  In the absence of plea having been raised or an issue framed or evidence led on the point, we are unable to hold that the agreement to sell was unconscionable. We do not find any error in the judgments and decrees passed by the courts below, accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with no order as to costs.","Appellant entered into a registered agreement to sell the land measuring 3.40 acres on 8.4.1986 with the defendant/respondents (hereinafter referred to as ""respondents"") Two suits were filed in the Trial Court.

" SANTOSH HEGDE,J. Being aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh passed in Criminal Appeal No.442-SB/1988, the State of Haryana is in appeal before us. The respondent herein was charged with an offence punishable under Section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short ’the Act’), and was tried for the same by the Additional Sessions Judge, Ambala, who found him guilty of the said offence and sentenced him to undergo R.I. for 10 years and to pay a fine of RS.1 lakh. It was further directed that in default of payment of fine, he shall undergo further RI for 5 years. It was the prosecution case that on 24.1.1987 the respondent, when apprehended and searched, was found carrying 15 kg. of opium. The prosecution case further stated that as required under Section 50 of the Act, the respondent was duly informed of his right of being searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate but he declined that offer, and based on the Panchnama of search and the evidence of the three witnesses, he was found guilty by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and sentenced, as stated above. In appeal, the High Court came to the conclusion that the prosecution has not established that as a matter of fact, the respondent was informed of his right under Section 50. It also noticed that the FIR filed in the case did not contain any averment to the effect that an offer to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate was made, hence, held that the prosecution case, that such an offer was made was an afterthought. It also came to the conclusion that the oral evidence of the prosecution witnesses cannot be relied upon and the Panch witness who was examined, was a stock witness who had earlier, in similar cases, given evidence on behalf of the prosecution and in this case had turned hostile, therefore, it was not safe to rely upon such evidence, accordingly, allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the respondent. As stated above, the State is in appeal before us. We have http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. It is an admitted fact that the offer of search as stipulated under Section 50 of the Act is not supported by any documentary evidence. Both in regard to this factum of offer of search and to establish its case, the prosecution relies upon the oral evidence. In our opinion, the High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that PW-1 who was examined in this regard has turned hostile and has not supported the case of the prosecution. The High Court has also noticed the fact that PW-1 was a stock witness for the Police. That being the case, the High Court felt it was not safe to rely on the evidence of PW-1, the Inspector, and PW-3, the Assistant Sub-Inspector. In such circumstances, we are not persuaded to take a contrary view. More so in the background of the fact, the search and seizure in this case was not proved to be in accordance with law. In the result, we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court. Accordingly, this appeal fails and the same is dismissed. ..................................J.

" D E R We   have  heard  learned  senior  counsel  for  the petitioners.  His only contention was that in the  light  of Clause 13(3)(vi)  of  the  C.P.  & Berar Rent Control Order, 1949, because the landlord is having other premises  of  his own  in  the  adjoining  part of the very suit premises, the suit for possession of the suit premises was liable to fail. The said provision reads as under :- ""13.(3)  If after hearing the parties the Controller is satisfied. (i)     ......... (ii)    ......... (iii)   ......... (iv)    ......... (v)     ......... (vi)    That the landlord needs the  premises  or  a portion  thereof, for the purpose of his bonafide occupation provided that he is not occupying any other premises of  his own in the city or town concerned; or. Learned  senior counsel for the petitioners it right when he contends that if the above clause is literally read, it would indicate that moment it is shown that the  landlord is  occupying any other premises of his own in the city, his suit for bonafide requirement of the suit premises can never be entertained and nothing more is required to be shown save and except establishing  on  record  that  the  landlord  is having other  premises of his own in the city.  It is not in dispute that the suit premises are situated  in  a  building where in other part the respondent - landlord is carrying on his  clinic and his need is for expansion of the said clinic and that  is  why  he  requires  the  suit  premises.    The aforesaid  contention  of  learned senior counsel would have required closer scrutiny but for the fact that  there  is  a decision  of  the  3  Judge  Bench  of  this Court in Boorgu Jagadeshwaraiah & Sons vs.  Pushpa Trading Co.  1998 (5) SCC 572, which repelled similar contention.  The  said  decision has  taken  the  view  on  a pari materia provision found in Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction)  Control Act,  1960,  wherein  Section  10(3)(a)(iii)provided  that a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 landlord may apply to the Controller for an order  directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building is  case  it is any other non - residential building, if the landlord is not occupying a non -  residential  building  in the  city,  town or village concerned which is his own or to the possession of which he is entitled  whether  under  this Act or  otherwise.   Construing these words, it was observed in para 8 of the report, as under :- ""That  the  aspects  of  quality, size and suitability of the building  have been  totally  put out of consideration by the courts below.   We  think  this  would frustrate the  purposes  of the Act.  Here would frustrate the purposes of  the  that the  non-residential premises he owned did not serve  the  purpose  of  his  need  of setting  up  a  textile and cloth business and that the need could  only  be  met  in seeking  eviction  of  the tenant from the premises sought."" Accepting the  said  contention,  this  Court  remanded  the proceedings for getting a finding on this aspect. In the facts of the present case, there is  a  clear finding  recorded  by  the Rent Controller as well as by the appellant court  that  300  sq.ft.    of  the  accommodation available  with  the  respondent-landlord in the building is insufficient for two doctors as the landlord  and  his  wife both are practising doctors. In  view  of  this  finding  arrived at on facts and accepted by the High Court, in our view, no need for  remand would arise.    The  ratio  of  the aforesaid decision would squarely state in the face of the petitioners. In the result, the petition fails and is dismissed.",The High Court has dismissed a petition seeking to evict the landlord. The landlord is a doctor and his wife are also practising doctors.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The appellant  is defendant  in O.S.  No. 288/84 on the file of  the District  Munsif Court,  Cheyyar. The appellant was set  ex-parte on  March 30, 1985. The respondent filed a suit  for  declaration  of  his  title  and  for  injunction restraining the   appellant  from interfering  with the suit property, i.e.,  the land  to the  extent of  2 acres and 30 cents. It is admitted that personal service was not effected on the  appellant.  It  would  appear  that  the  Court  has directed to  effect the substitute service by publication in the newspaper  but that also did not reach the appellant. On becoming aware of the ex-parte decree and order in 1990, the appellant filed  an application  under  Order  9,  Rule  13, C.P.C. within  30 days from the date of his knowledge to set aside the  decree and  order. He  filed an application under Section 5  of the  Limitation Act  to condone the delay. The District Judge condoned the delay holding that : ""I uphold  the submissions  of  the petitioner that  the petitioner had no knowledge of the case nor he was aware of  the pending  case,    and therefore, he is entitled to prefer this petition  within 30  days from the date  of knowledge.  Hence  the petition  is allowed."" Against the aforesaid order, the respondent carried the matter in  revision. The  learned single  Judge allowed  the petition setting  aside the  order passed  by  the  District Judge. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It is contended by Sri Sampath, learned counsel for the respondent, that  the respondent  had taken  all  the  steps available under  Order 5  CPC including of effecting service through substitute  service under  Rule 20A,  Order  5  CPC. Therefore, the  Court was  right in setting the appellant ex parte and  passing the ex-parte decree. The learned District Judge after going through the entire material on record came to the  above conclusion  that the  appellant had  not  been served with  a notice  and, therefore,   he  was entitled to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 file the  application under  Article 123  of the Schedule of Limitation Act, which is 30 days from the date of knowledge. Accordingly, the  application  came  to  be  filed,  through belated by 2015 days. Under these circumstances, the learned District Judge  was right  in holding that the appellant had filed the  application to  set  aside  the  ex-parte  appeal within 30  days from  the date  of knowledge. The High Court was clearly in error in interfering with the order passed by the District Judge. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Criminal  Appeal  No. 224 of 1974. From  the  Judgment  and  Order  Dated  8.1.73  of  the Rajasthan High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 776 of 1970. Naunit Lal & Kailash Vasdev. for the appellant. B.D. Sharma for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD,  C.J.  Four  persons  were  tried  by  the learned Sessions  Judge, Bhilwara,  under section  302  read with section  34  of  the  Penal  Code.  The  learned  Judge acquitted three  out of  the four accused and convicted only one of  them,  namely,  Kanahiya  Lal.  The  High  Court  of Rajasthan confirmed  the conviction of Kanahiya Lal, as also the acquittal  of two  out of  the three  persons  who  were acquitted by  the Sessions  Judge. The  High Court, however, set aside  the acquittal  of the  appellant,  convicted  him under section 302 read with section 34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Since  the  High  Court  has  set  aside  an  order  of acquittal  and   has  sentenced   the  appellant   to   life imprisonment, it  is necessary to consider whether two views of the  evidence are  reasonably possible  and whether,  the High Court  was justified  in setting  aside  the  order  of acquittal passed  by  the  trial  Court  in  favour  of  the appellant. Having  approached  the  case  and  assessed  the evidence from that point of view, we are of the opinion that it is  impossible to  agree with the view taken by the trial court. The  High Court  has specifically  dealt with reasons given by  the  trial  court  in  support  of  the  order  of acquittal and  has demonstrated  in a good measure as to why those reasons  cannot be  accepted. We  concur in  the  High Court’s appreciation of evidence. The  incident   out  of  which  the  prosecution  arose happened at  about 8  p.m. On September 29, 1968 at Bhilwara Rajasthan, leading to the death of one Gyanchand. The motive for the  offence is  alleged to be that Gyanchand’s brother, Nemi Chand,  owed money  to accused  Nos. 3 and 4, Ram Niwas and Badri  Lal. Nemi Chand was evading to pay the debt which created bitterness  between the two brothers on one hand and accused Nos.  3 and  4 on  the  other.  The  latter,  it  is alleged, procured  the help of the appellant and of Kanahiya Lal in doing Gyanchand to death. 861 The prosecution  examined a few witnesses in support of its   case but it is unnecessary to refer to the evidence of each one  of them. The most important witness in the case is Bodu Lal  (P.W. 2).  He is  an independent witness, in whose cycle rickshaw the appellant and the co-accused Kanahiya Lal travelled from  the hotel of Shankar Maharaj to the scene of offence.  Bodu   Lal  identified   the  appellant   in   the identification  parade.   According  to  his  evidence,  the appellant was  wearing a  yellow baniyan  at the time of the incident. When  the appellant was arrested. a yellow baniyan was found on his person and it was stained with human blood. A knife stained with human blood was also recovered from his person. The High  Court has  convicted the appellant relying on the evidence  of Bodu  Lal, as corroborated by the discovery http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 of the  blood stained baniyan and knife. This evidence seems to us  unassailable. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal and confirm the judgment of the High Court. S.R.      Appeal dismissed. 862",Kanahiya Lal was convicted of killing Gyanchand Chand in 1968. The High Court of Rajasthan confirmed the conviction and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2124 of 1972 From the  Judgment and  order  dated  8.7.1971  of  the Bombay High Court in S.C.A. No. 148 of 1967. 182 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 Rajinder Sacher,  P.K. Ram, R.D. Suverna and D.N. Misra for the Appellant. Anil Deo  Singh, Mrs.  Sushma Relan  and C.V.S. Rao for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BALAKRISHNA ERADI,  J. We  find no merit at all in this appeal which has been filed on the strength of a certificate granted by  the High  Court of  Bombay by  its  order  dated January 12, 1972 under Article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution of India  against the judgment of the High Court dated April 8, 1971  dismissing the Special Civil Application No. 148 of 1967 filed by the appellant. The appellant  is the  sole proprietor of the Navbharat Trading  Company,   carrying  on   business  in   cloth   at Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur. The challenge raised by him in the Writ Petition  filed in  the  High  Court  was  against  the appellate and  revisional orders  passed by the Collector of Central  Excise,   Bombay  and   the  Government   of  India respectively holding  that the  appellant had  been  rightly assessed and  called upon  to pay  excise duty  amounting to Rs.53,190  in   respect  of   cloth  manufactured   in  some powerlooms and  purported to have been purchased by him from the owners  of those  powerlooms. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise,  as well  as the  Appellate  and  Revisional Authorities have  concurrently  found  that  yarn  had  been supplied to  the powerlooms  by one Tejpal for and on behalf of  the   appellant,  that   the  cloth   in  question   was manufactured by  the powerloom  owners for  and on behalf of the appellant himself and that the powerloom owners received only an  amount equal  to the  labour charges. Though, these were findings on pure question of fact, they were challenged by the  appellant before  the High  Court on the ground that they were  not supported  by any material and were perverse. On that  basis it  was contended  before the High Court that the appellant  should be  held not to be the manufacturer of the cloth  in question  and hence  not liable for payment of excise duty. The High  Court after  a detailed  consideration of all the aspects  of the  case found  that the  books of accounts produced by  the appellant  before  the  Excise  Authorities contained clear  evidence of  the fact  that  the  appellant himself was the owner of the yearn alleged to have been sold by Tejpal to the powerloom owners and that the appellant got 183 back that very yarn in the shape of cloth after it was woven into cloth.  After referring to the details of the evidence, the High Court observed: ""These particulars  and details  go to  show that there was clear  and cogent  evidence on  the record  of  the department to  enable the assessing authorities to make inferential findings  that the  transactions of alleged sale of  yarn by Tejpal to the powerloom owners and the transactions  of  alleged  purchase  of  cloth  by  the petitioner from  the powerloom  owners were  camouflage for the  petitioner to get powerloom cloth manufactured by himself  by employing  powerlooms of  the  powerloom owners."" We see  no scope  at  all  for  interference  with  the aforesaid conclusion  of fact reached by the High Court. The consequential position  that emerges  is that  the appellant himself was the manufacturer of the cloth in question and he must be held to have been rightly assessed to excise duty in respect of the cloth so got manufactured in the powerlooms. The appeal  accordingly fails  and  is  dismissed  with costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 S.R.

" O R D E R Substitution allowed. This appeal by special leave arises against the order of the  Division Bench  of the  Punjab &  Haryana High Court made on  20.9.1978 in  LPA No.404/75 confirming the order of the learned single Judge dated May 8, 1975 setting aside the order of  taking over  possession of  the surplus land dated July 20,  1961 and  directing redetermination of the surplus land. The  admitted facts  are that the Collector exercising the power  under PEPSU  Tenancy and  Agricultural Lands Act, 1955 determined  surplus land  of the  respondents at  18.82 standard acres  by proceedings dated May 28, 1960. The order was not challenged by filing the appeal. Notice of surrender was given  on June  3, 1961  calling upon the respondents to deliver possession  of the aforesaid surplus land within ten days from the date of the receipt or the notice. Admittedly, the possession  of 18.82 standard acres of land was taken by the State  officials from  Inder Singh  who had acknowledged taking over possession on July 12, 1961. Subsequently,  it   would   appear   by   consolidation proceedings that had taken place in the year 1961-62, it was found that  Inder Singh  was having less extent of land than the prescribed  standard acres  under the Act. Consequently, when he  filed an  application before  the authorities,  the Commissioner as well as the revisional authorities negatived the claim  resulting in  filing of  the  writ  petition.  As stated earlier,  the learned  single Judge  and the Division Bench of  the High Court have set aside the Government order on the  ground that  Inder Singh  was found having less land than the  prescribed standard  acres under  the Act  as  was determined in  the consolidation proceedings. Therefore, the surplus land was required to be redetermined and restituted. The  question is:  whether the view taken by the High Court is correct in law? When the standard acres which Inder Singh was entitled to retain was determined and surplus land of an extent of 18.82 standard acres was determined by order http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 dated May 28, 1960. That order having been allowed to became final. would  it be  open  to  Inder  Singh  or  any  person claiming title  through him  to seek  redetermination.  When they had  not challenged  the order  and subsequently in the consolidation proceedings  he was  found to hold less extent than the  prescribed standard  holding, are they entitled to redetermination? We  are of  the considered  view that it is impermissible. It would be open to Inder Singh or any person claiming title  under him to have challenged the correctness of determinating  surplus land  by filing  appeal before the appropriate forum.  Admittedly, no  steps had been taken. On the other  hand, the  order was  allowed to become final and possession of  the surplus  land of 18.82 standard acres was taken over  as admitted  by Inder  Singh by  the proceedings July 12,  1961. The land was simultaneously redistributed to the landless persons as per the scheme of the Government who are the  appellants before  this Court.  Having allowed that order dated  May 28,  1960 and  the proceedings  of delivery dated July 12, 1961 to become final, it would not be open to either Inder  Singh  or  anybody  on  his  behalf  to  claim redetermination. The  view of  the  High  Court  is  clearly illegal. The  appeal is accordingly allowed. The writ petition stands dismissed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. The appellant  was appointed  on April 20, 1990 and was discharged from  service on July 22, 1992 on the ground that he remained  absent from  duty for more than 1 month 9 days. Another ground was that he was irregular in attending to the duty. So  he could  not prove  himself to  be  an  efficient Constable. We  had sent  for the records which disclose that he was  absent on  three occasions.  On the  first occasions when he  was called  upon to  report for duty at 12 noon, he reported on September 10, 1990 and was late by six hours. On the second  occasion, he  was absent, on June 30, 1991, from night duty.  The third  occasion was  on April 24, 1995. The explanation offered  for the  absence on  third occasion was that since  in his  wife’s delivery certain complication had arisen, he  had to attend to his wife and so he could not be present.  The   Medical  Certificate   in  that  behalf  was produced. In  view of  the Medical certificate, it cannot be said that he had deliberately absented himself from duty. On the previous  two occasions,  the absence for one day and in another year  for one  night  cannot  be  considered  to  be regular absence  so as  to reach  the conclusion that he had not proved  his efficiency.  It is  true that  discipline is required to be maintained, However, absence may sometimes be inevitable. In  the facts and circumstances of this case, an opportunity  may   be  given   to  the   appellant  to  work efficiently to  prove his excellence. The order of discharge is set  aside. The  respondents are  directed  to  take  the appellant into  service forthwith.  If the appellant absents himself again  for two  consecutive  days  within  one  year without prior permission, appropriate action may be taken by dismissing him  from service. The appellant, however, is not entitled to back-wages. Appeal is accordingly allowed.

" O R D E R We have heard the learned counsel on both sides. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short,  the ""Act"") was published on March 5, 1983  acquiring  33  acres  84  cents  of  land  in  village Srungavruksham in  Bhimavaram Taluk, West Godavati District, Andhra Pradesh  for construction  of FCI  godowns. The  Land Acquisition Officer  in his  award made  under Section 11 on March 30,  1984  determined  compensation  at  the  rate  of Rs.32,500/- per acre for wet land and @ Rs.32,000/- per acre for  dry   land.  On   reference,  the   subordinate  Judge, Bhimavaram enhanced the compensation to Rs.90,000/- per acre by his  award and  decree made  under Section 26 on December 27, 1988.  On appeal,  the Division   Bench  of  the  Andhra Pradesh High  Court by  order dated October 25, 1991 in A.S. Nos.1392, 1393  and 1394/89  set  aside  the  award  of  the reference Court  and confirmed  that of the Land Acquisition Officer. Thus, these appeals by special leave. Though the  claimants have  relied upon voluminous sale transactions running  into as  many as 20 sale transactions, Ex.A-1 to  A-20 all,  except Ex.A-4,  are  post-notification sales. So they cannot be relied upon as comparable ones. The only relevant document in this case is the sale deed, Ex.A-4 dated June  17, 1982  in respect of land admeasuring 5 cents sold for  a sum  of Rs.7500/-.  The reference  court dealing with  all  the  sale  transactions  granted  compensation  @ Rs.90,000/- per  acre. When  a large  extent of  land of  33 acres 84  cents is  acquired for the purpose of constructing godowns, no willing prudent purchase the land at the rate of Rs.90,000/- per  acre based  on  mere  a  sale  deed  Ex.A-4 involving 5  cents of  land. The reference Court, therefore, was obviously  in gross  error in relying upon that document apart from other documents, in determining the compensation. The question  then is:  what would  be  the  reasonable compensation which the lands were capable to fetch as on the date of  the notification?  It is  an indisputable fact that all these  lands are  agricultural fertile lands situated in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 West Godavari District and no prudent vendor would sell even at the  depressed price  for not  less than  Rs.50,000/- per acre. It is brought out to our notice from the evidence that railway track  pass near  the acquired  land and there is an easy access  to railway  station; near  the land acquired is also situated  a cinema hall; there are built up areas apart from mango  growth around  the acquired  land.  Under  these circumstances, the  lands are capable of double crops; being wet land  they cannot be sold at a lesser price. Normally, a prudent seller  would sell  and the  prudent purchaser would purchase at  the rate of not less than Rs.50,000/- per acre. Considered from  this perspective  and going  by  the  above price, we  hold that  the market value of the acquired lands would be Rs.50,000/- per acre. The claimants are entitled to the statutory solatium and interest granted by the reference Court. As  regards the  value of the trees, the award of the reference Court  has not  been interfered  with by  the High Court. The appeal  is accordingly allowed and the judgment and order   of the  High Court  stand set aside and the award of the reference  Court  stands  modified.  The  claimants  are entitled to  the compensation at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per acre with  solatium at  30% on  the  enhanced  compensation, interest at  9% from  the date  of the taking possession for one year  and 15%  on enhanced  compensation thereafter till date of  deposit in court. The claimants are entitled to 12% per  annum  of  additional  amount  from  the  date  of  the notification till date of the award under Section 11. The appeals are accordingly allowed.

" O R D E R By order dated August 20,1996, we allowed the appeal of the respondent Union of India and set aside the order of the Tribunal granting  the benefit  of pension to the applicant. The applicant  has filed  the present applications to recall the order.  It is stated therein that since he has not well, could not  appear on 13.8.1996 when the appeal was initially listed and  intimation to  that effect was given by him. The matter was  thereafter listed on 20.8.1996 but he was not be present on  that date  and the  matter was  disposed  of  ex parte. When  the petitioner choses to appear in person , the Court is  not expected  to give an intimation to the parties of the  date of adjournment. Once intimation is given, it is the duty  of the  party to make note of the subsequent dates and make  himself available  and appear  when  the  case  is called out.  However, we  took care  to satisfy ourselves of the  grievance   of  the   applicant  by  calling  upon  the respondents to explain us the position. The  controversy   is  no   longer  res   integra.  The entitlement to  the benefit of the pension was considered by this Court  in Krishna  Kumar vs. Union of India & Ors. [AIR 1990 SC  1782-JT 1990  (3) SC 173]. Following that judgment, this Court  had set  aside the  order of the Tribunal. It is seen that  the Claim  of the  petitioner is  that he did not have knowledge  of the extension of the last date for giving the option.  It is  his case  that he  retired  in  November 30,1975 and  he did  not have any opportunity of knowing the extended date.  That is  falsified by  the record.  For  the first time,  it was  extended upto  January 1,1973.  It  was further extended  upto July  23,1974; thereafter,  upto June 25,1975, June,  30, 1976, January 3,1978 and the last of the extensions was  till  December  31,1978.  While  he  was  in service, he  had the  opportunity to  register the option on three occasions,  namely, on  January 1,1973,  July 23, 1974 and June  25,1975. He  did not  exercise the  option at that time. The  option was  as regards  principle of gratuity. He thought that   would  be a  better principle advantageous to him. He  withdrew the  retinal  benefits.  Later,  when  the pension scheme was sought to be given to several persons, he came forward  at a  belated stage  saying that he was not in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 know of  extension till 1991. When others were given benefit by the   Tribunal, he came  to file the petition. In view of the aforesaid  facts, it  is hard  to believe that he had no notice  of   exercising  the   option  for   the  pensionary benefits. Under  these circumstances,  we do  not  find  any illegality in  the order  passed by this Court for recalling the order. The   interlocutory    application   is,    accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and decree  of the  High Court  of Judicature  at  Allahabad dated July 15, 1976 made in Civil First Appeal No.11/65. The State filed  the suit for recovery of possession of property from the  respondents pursuant  to the  orders passed  under Section 145  of the  Cr.P.C. The  civil Court  dismissed the suit but on appeal the High Court allowed the same. The  admitted   facts  are  that  the  land  originally belonged to  Smt. Kokilla.  Notification under Section  4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [for short, the ’Act’] was published on  April 15, 1928 and declaration under Section 6 was published  on July  28, 1928 acquiring the land known as Phulwari for public purposes namely, for construction of the quarters for  the constables of Police outpost Misrana. That acquisition has  become  final.  Now,  the  High  Court  has recorded a  finding of  fact that  compensation was  paid to Smt. Kokila  and, therefore,  the land  stood vested  in the State  under   Section  16   of  the   Act  free   from  all encumbrances. The contention  raised by  the appellant  is  that  the proceedings were  taken under  the U.P.  Encumbered  Estates Act, 1955  and the  property was  declared to  be encumbered estate. As  a consequence,  the  title  of  the  appellants’ predecessor was upheld. He being the purchaser at an auction is entitled  to the  possession by  virtue of  his title. We find no  force in  the contention.  Having acquired the land under the  provisions of  the Act  and the possession having been taken thereunder, the rights title and interest held by Smt. Kokila  stood extinguished and vested in the State free from  all  encumbrances.  Consequently,  the  State  is  the absolute owner.  The State,  being the owner, is entitled to file the suit for possession. The High Court, therefore, has rightly found  that the  appellants at this distance of time cannot question  the correctness  of the acquisition made in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 1928.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.5707 OF 2002 Heard the parties. This appeal is filed by the defendants against the judgment passed by the High Court in Second Appeal. The plaintiffs’ suit was dismissed by the trial court.  In appeal the First Appellate Court confirmed the decree of the trial court.  Aggrieved thereby, the plaintiffs filed Second Appeal before the High Court. The High Court framed a substantial question of law as under : 1.      It is open to the appellants to challenge the sale on the following grounds : a)The property was subject to mortgage and there was contravention of the sections 35 and 85 of the Karnataka Co- operative Societies Act, 1959. b)The sale was in breach of Order 21 Rule 64 CPC on the ground that the property sold was worth much more than the amount sought to be recovered. c)Status as debtor of the father of the appellants who suffered decree for money? 2.      Whether the decree made by the lower appellate court is vitiated for its failure to consider the points involved in question No.1? At the time of hearing of the Second Appeal the High Court has also framed the additional substantial question of law reads : ""12.    The question of law was framed as mentioned supra. At the time of hearing, one more question was framed and the counsel was directed to address arguments on the basis of that question as well. The question is : ""Once a property is found to be ancestral property whether that the property of the minors who get the right by birth could be brought to sale ?"" It is submitted that the property is ancestral property and the father was acting as Manager and Karta of the family. If that is the case the question of framing the additional substantial question of law would not arise.  Similarly, the substantial question of law as framed by the High Court, a),b) and c), referred to above, in our view, does not constitute the substantial question of law as contemplated under Section 100 CPC.  We, therefore, set aside the order of the High Court and remand the case to the High Court to frame fresh substantial question of law strictly compliance of Section 100 CPC, if any, and decide the appeal afresh.  The order of the High Court is accordingly set aside. The appeal is allowed. No costs.

" JUDGMENT 2001 (1) SCR 487 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Special Leave granted. In the instant case, the respondent was a Bus Conductor working with the appellant-Corporation. A domestic inquiry was held in which it was alleged that he had collected at a particular trip of the bus Rs. 2.25 from each of the 35 passengers but had issued tickets of the denomination of Rs. 1.75 only. As a result of the domestic inquiry, the respondent was dismissed from service. Reference was made to the Labour Court which came to the conclusion that the domestic inquiry was not fair or proper. Opportunity was given to the appellant to produce evidence which it did. After recording the evidence, the Labour Court by the impugned award came to the conclusion that the allegation that the Conductor had issued tickets of Rs. 1.75 instead of Rs. 2.25 was proved but it had not been proved that he had collected the amount of Rs. 2.25 from the passengers. The Labour Court set aside the punishment of dismissal and directed reinstatement with full back wages. On a writ petition being filed by the appellant- Corporation, the Single Judge dismissed the same after noting that the Labour Court had awarded 50 percent of the back wages with reinstatement. Realising that this was a mistake, the Single Judge rectified the same and ordered reinstatement with full back wages, the letters patent appeal was dismissed. Hence, this appeal by special leave. On the facts as found by the Labour Court and the High Court, it is evident that there was a short-charging of the fare by the respondent from as many as 35 passengers. We are informed that the respondent had been in service as a Conductor for nearly 22 years. It is difficult to believe that he did not know what was the correct fare which was to be charged. Further-more, the appellant had during the disciplinary proceedings taken into account the fact that the respondent had been found guilty for as many as 36 times on different dates. Be that as it may, the principle of res ipsa loquitur, namely, the facts speak for themselves, is clearly applicable in the instant case. Charging 50 paise per ticket less from as many as 35 passengers could only be to get financial benefit by the Conductor. this act was either dishonest or was so grossly negligent that the respondent was not fit to be retained as a Conductor because such action or inaction of his is bound to result in financial loss to the appellant-Corporation. It is misplaced sympathy by the Labour Courts in such cases when on checking it is fund that the Bus Conductors have either not issued tickets to a large number of passengers, though they should have, or have issued http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 tickets of a lower denomination knowing fully well the correct fare to be charged. It is the responsibility of the Bus Conductors to collect the correct fare from the passengers and deposit the same with the Company. they act in a fiduciary capacity and it would be a case of gross misconduct if knowingly they do not collect any fare or the correct amount of fare. In our opinion, the order of dismissal should not have been set aside, but we are informed that in the meantime the respondent has already superannuated. We, therefore, on the special facts of this case, do not set aside the order of reinstatement, but direct that the respondent would not be entitled to any back wages at all but he would be entitled to the retiral benefits. The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.","The Labour Court set aside the punishment of dismissal and directed reinstatement with full back wages.

The  Appellate  Court  has  only stated that ""no order was communicated"".

By order dated 29.9.2006, the said writ petitions stood transferred to this Court. Having regard to the arguments advanced before us and in view of the fact that the entitlement of Domestic Users for financial year 2005-06 is going to lapse on 31.3.2007 the following interim order is passed. DGFT would be entitled to grant licences to the applicants who are so entitled under policy circular No. 24 dated 30.8.2005. To that extent our order dated 29.9.2006 stands vacated. In T.P. (C) No. 579/06 filed by the Director General of Foreign Trade it has been inter alia stated that on account of representations received from the traders and the material (including complaints) gathered by DGFT, the impugned new policy came to be enacted. This was after detailed discussions with the Trade. The broad features of the new policy and the reasons for enacting the policy are given in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of T.P. (C) No. 579/06. However, it appears that the requisite material was not supplied to the affected 100% EOUs. who have complained before us that the changes have been made in FTP vide the impugned policy without giving any opportunity to the affected Units. At this stage we may point out that learned Solicitor General of India stated before us that the impugned policy decision  is taken on certain material (including complaints/ representations received) which he is prepared to disclose to the concerned EOUs. Accordingly,  we direct DGFT to supply the material in its possession to the affected EOUs., who have filed the writ petitions, on or before 15.1.2007. The said petitioners (EOUs.) who have filed writ petitions in the High Court shall thereafter make representations to the DGFT within 10 days on and from the receipt of the material (including complaints) from DGFT. Thereafter, DGFT will decide the matter in accordance with law. We make it clear that it will be open to DGFT to equitably work out the matter, if possible. One point, however, needs to be mentioned. It is stated on behalf http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of  M/s Hindustan Granites that they have accumulated wastes which they are entitled to sell in DTA under the unamended policy. It is contended on behalf of M/s Hindustan Granites that they have fulfilled the benchmark of Net Foreign Exchange earnings and, therefore, they were entitled to sell the accumulated wastes in the domestic market (DTA) under para 6.8 (h) on payment of full duty. On this point, M/s Hindustan Granites can also make the representation giving facts and figures regarding the quantity of waste which has accumulated and it will be open to DGFT if possible to decide the question regarding sale of the said waste in the DTA. The question as to whether the impugned circulars/notifications constitutes a change in the policy or whether it is a matter of detail within the existing policy is the question which will be decided on the next date of hearing when we will examine the merits of the case. On receiving the report from DGFT, we shall hear the matter on merits on the next occasion. In the meantime, the ban on EOU Units undertaking DTA sales shall continue to remain in operation. Consequently, interim order of the Rajasthan High Court dated 26.10.2005 in DB Civil Writ Petition No. 5811/05 shall remain stayed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS.4305-4306 OF 2002 The respondent-assessee claimed exemption under Section 10(23) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the Assessment Years 1991-92 and 1992-93.  The said exemption was claimed on the basis that the objects of the respondent-assessee are exclusively charitable.  The assessing officer rejected the claim.  Appeals filed before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) were also dismissed.  Aggrieved thereby, the assessee filed further appeals before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (’the Tribunal’).  The Tribunal, by order dated 20th January 2001, allowed the appeals filed by the respondent-assessee.  The appellant filed appeals before the High Court of Gujarat.  The Revenue claimed that the following two substantial questions of law arise from the order of the Tribunal : ""(A) Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in law in holding that the objects of the Trust restricting benefit to the members of the Club would fall within the purview of the act of ""General Public Utility"" u/s 2(15) of the Income Tax Act constituting as a section of public and not a Body of Individuals?

By the impugned order, the High Court dismissed the appeals,  in limine, relying on a decision of the same Court in the case of Hiralal Bhagwati v. Commissioner of Income-Tax 2000 (246) ITR 188 = 2000 (161) CTR (Gujarat) 401 holding that the questions raised in the appeals are covered by the aforesaid decision. Being dissatisfied by the order of the High Court, the Revenue has filed these appea ls. This Court, on 22nd July 2002, granted leave in respect of Question No.’B’ only.  Th e appeals were not entertained in respect of Question No.’A’ and it was noted that the appeals by the High Court were rightly dismissed insofar as Question No.’A’ is concerned as the appellant did not challenge the correctness of the judgment in the case of Hiralal Bhagwati (supra). On a perusal of the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Hiralal Bhagwa http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ti (supra), we now find that Question No.’B’ is also concluded by the said judgment [refer to 1st para of page 196].  Since the Revenue did not challenge the decision in the said case, t he same has attained finality.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard  learned counsel for the parties. These appeals  by special  leave arise  from the  Order dated May  14, 1996  passed by the Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal, Madras  in O.A.  Nos. 2354, 2477 and 6373 of 1993. The admitted  facts are that the respondent was working as a doctor. He  proceeded on  leave and made a representation on June 27,  1987 with regard to his posting. He did not report for duty  for five  years from  May 1,  1982. A departmental enquiry came  to be  conducted against the respondent, under Rule 17  (b) of  the Tamil  Nadu  Services  (Discipline  and Appeal) Rules.  The competent  authority  removed  him  form service on  the ground  that the  respondent was found to be unauthorisedly absent  from duty for five year. The Tribunal is its  impugned order  set aside  the order  of his removal from service  and directed  to pay 50% of the back wage till the dated  of filing  of the  original application  and full back  wages   form  the   dated  filing   of  the   original applications till  the dated  of reinstatement.  This  Court issued notice  confined  to  the  question  of  respondent’s entitlement to  back wages.  It would  be obvious  that  the respondent did  not choose  to join the duty for five years. There is  nothing on  the part of the State Government which prevented the respondent from attending to his duties. Under these circumstance,  the Tribunal  is wholly  wrong  in  its direction to  the appellants  to pay  50% of  the back wages from the  date of his absence till the date of filing of the original application  and  back  wage  thereafter  till  his reinstatement. Accordingly,  the appeal  are allowed and the direction to pay back wages stand set aside. No cost.",A doctor was found to have been unauthorisedly absent from duty for five years.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Special  Leave  Petition (Civil) No. 7213 of 1987. From  the  Judgment and Order dated 19.5.  1987  of  the Andhra Pradesh High Court in W.A. No. 672 of 1987. P.P. Rao and P.P. Singh for the Appellant. 567 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. This petition arises out of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. Sree P.P.  Rao, learned counsel for the petitioner  submits  that the order of release was bad because the authorised  officer had  no  power to review the previous order nor he  had  the power  to release the property of the landlady without  even giving  an  opportunity to the petitioner. In the  facts  of this  case  as  noted by the High Court, we  are  unable  to entertain  these  contentions. We are unable to  accept  the contention that the Government cannot review its own  order. It  is well-settled law of this Court that in case  of  bona fide  need subsequent events must be taken into  account  if they  are relevant on the question of release or  possession of  the  premises in question. On a  previous  occasion  the Government  had  declined  to release  the  premises,  later on  .the representation made by the landlady the  Government changed its decision. The landlady had filed an  application for  releasing the premises in her favour, but the same  was initially  rejected on 25.9.1978. Again the landlady made  a further representation stating certain additional and  fresh circumstances, that is to say, that her son was not allowing her to live with him in another house belonging to her.  The Government  took  into  account the  subsequent  events  and passed  the  order on 19.3. 1980 releasing the  premises  in favour of the landlady. We do not see how to take cognizance of  such  subsequent events releasing the  premises  can  be described an order in nullity in the facts of this case. The  next  contention  was that the  petitioner  was  an allottee  of the premises by virtue of his being in  service but  the petitioner was really a tenant of the  premises  in question. The Government informed the petitioner to make  alterna- tive  arrangements  or seek  accommodation.  The  Government issued several notices on 24.11.1978, 22.5.1979,  12.7.1979, 27.9.1970  and 17.1.1980 to the petitioner and  these  facts have  been  stated and have also been taken note of  by  the High Court in the judgment under challenge. In spite of  the said notices given to the petitioner who was an allottee and who was informed about the requirement of the landlady,  the petitioner did not choose to move out from the premises.  In the  meantime,  the petitioner has retired from  service  in 1986 and a long time has passed now. In this case we do  not think  it  can be said that the order was  bad  because  the petitioner  was initially not given an opportunity  to  show cause.  Actually the petitioner had enough  opportunity.  In the premises, the special leave petition fails and we do 568 not find any ground to interfere with the order of the  High Court. Having  regard  to  the facts that  the  petitioner  had acquired  government accommodation and he has stayed in  the premises  in  question for sometime, we allow  him  to  make alternative  arrangement by 31.12.1987. The order for  evic- tion  will  not be executed until  31.12.1987  provided  the petitioner  files an undertaking in this Court  within  four weeks  from  today to vacate and hand over the  premises  in question.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Madhya Pradesh  High Court,  Jabalpur Bench, made on February 10,  1981 in Miscellaneous Petition No. 812/80. The appellants were  working as Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the Madhya  Pradesh Veterinary Services Gazetted. The Madhya Pradesh Veterinary  Services is governed by the rules called Madhya Pradesh  Services (Gazetted) Recruitment Rules, 1966. The channel of recruitment to the post of Assistant Director Veterinary Service  was from  two  sources,  namely,  direct recruitment and  promotion in  the proportion  of one  is to one. An  advertisement came to be made by the Madhya Pradesh Public  Service   Commission  of   28  posts   of  Assistant Directors. The appellants had challenged the validity of the Notification and selection on the ground that the Government had, by  then decided, to provide recruitment to the post of Assistant Directors  by promotion  with 100% from the feeder cadre, namely, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. It is found, as a fact,  by the  High Court  that as  on  the  date  of  the notification, the  rules were  not amended.  Unamended Rules provide that  the  recruitment  was  to  be  made  from  two sources, namely,  direct recruitment  and by  promotion at a ratio of  one is to one. Consequently, the advertisement for recruitment of  Assistant and by promotion at a ratio of one is to  one. Consequently,  the advertisement for recruitment of Assistant  Directors by the Public Service Commission and Selection and  appointment of the challenged in this appeal. It is seen that undoubtedly though decision was taken by the Government, the  Rules have not been amended. Therefore, the advertisement made  for recruitment  of fill up the posts of Assistant Directors, by direct recruitment and consequential selection as  per the  unamended Rules  for the  50% of  the vacancies earmarked for direct recruitment was in accordance with the  aforesaid Rules.  As a consequence, the view taken by the  High Court  is consistent  with the Rules. We do not find any illegality warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Heard counsel for the parties. Leave granted. The respondent  was allotted an industrial plot. He had to pay  25% of the price in the beginning and the balance in 6 equal  instalments. He  only paid the first instalment but not the rest. A Show cause notice was given to him on 5.9.94 under section  17 (3)  of the  Huda Act.  A notice proposing imposition of  penalty was  also issued. These notices could not be  served upon him and therefore notices were served by affixture. A  notice dated  l0.1.95 was also given providing personal hearing. The respondent never appeared. Accordingly the plot was resumed under section 17 (4) of the Act and the amount deposited was forfeited. The appeal preferred by the respondent was dismissed by the Appellate Authority who held that though  several notices  were issued to the respondent, he has been evading service. It dismissed the appeal holding that  in  view  of  the  persistent  defaults  make  by  the respondent, there  was no ground for interference in appeal. The respondent  therefore approached  Punjab &  Haryana High Court  by  way  of  a  writ  petition.  He  pleaded  certain financial difficulties.  Without recording  a finding  as to the correctness  of the  said plea  assuming for the sake of argument that  such a  course  was  permissible  in  a  writ petition the  High Court  allowed the  petition ""keeping  in view the financial stringency of the petitioner, interest of the parties,  readiness and willingness of the petitioner to pay the  remaining unpaid  amount and to set the controversy at rest. The High Court further directed that interest shall be charged  only at  10% per annum on the amount due and not at the rate of 18% as calculated by the authority for a part of the period. We are  of the  opinion that  in a writ petition it was not open  to  the  High  Court  to  entertian  the  plea  of financial stringency  for the first time. The respondent who had not responded to repeated notices and had not availed of the person  hearing offered  to him, could not be allowed to plead such  financial stringency  for the  first time before the High  Court.  Indeed  the  High  Court  could  not  have entertained such a plea. It has been held repeatedly by this http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court that  the power  under Article  226 is  the  power  of judicial  review.  The  High  Court  can  only  examine  the procedural correctness.  It cannot so into the merits of the controversy like  an  appellate  authority.  No  finding  is recorded by  the High  Court in this case that the procedure adopted by  the Estate  Officer was either not in accordance with the  statutory previsions  or was  in violation  of the principles of  natural justice.  The  High  Court  obviously acted as  an appellate authority and that to as a benevolent appellate authority.  There is  no room  for any benevolence under Article  226 of the Constitution. If the court departs from law  and enters the arena of benevolence the perils and pitfalls are too many to recount. There will be no objective standards of  judging. Justice  becomes personlised It would vary from  Judge to  Judge. In the absence of any procedural irregularity,  the   High  Court   had  no  jurisdiction  to interfere in  the matter.  The High  Court  also  failed  to notice that  the respondent  is guilty  of  not  paying  the instalments as  undertaken by  him. By  interfering  on  the basis of  unverified and  unsubstantiated plea  of financial stringency, the  Court  wound  be  encouraging  contumacious conduct and breach of undertakings. The appeal  is accordingly allowed. The Judgment of the High Court  is set  aside. The  writ petition  filed by  the respondent shall stand dismissed.

" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. R- 53, Sector M.T. Ratia, District Hisar vide letter no. 4775 dated 21st March, 1982.    The Respondent paid all dues but was not offered possession. On these facts, the District Forum directed payment of interest @ 15% on deposited amount after the expiry of two years from the date of deposit.   It further held that the amount of penalty charged, if any, would be adjusted in the remaining installments. The State Forum found no case for interference and dismissed the Appeal.  The Respondent did not go in Revision before the National Commission.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission has increased the rate of interest to 18% p.a. For reasons set out in the Judgment in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra), the order of the National Commission cannot be sustained and is hereby set aside.  As http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 stated above, the relevant papers regarding the claim made, the affidavits filed, the evidence submitted before the District Forum are not produced before this Court.  In this case, the allotment was made in 1982 and the possession offered and taken in 2003.   Interest amount has also been paid.  On these facts, we maintain the order of the District Forum. However, a complaint is made that the Appellants are not executing the sale deed and are not giving permission to construct. We, therefore, direct the Appellants to execute the sale deed and to give permission to construct without claiming any amounts whatsoever, except registration charges, from the Respondent.  The same is to be done within one month from today. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition has been filed against the judgment of  the Kerala High Court, made on November 7, 1996 in writ Appeal No.850/1996. Admittedly, the petitioner and her husband were charged for an offence under Section 302 and also Section 201 I.P.C. etc. While  the husband of the petitioner was convicted, she was acquitted  of the  offences under  Sections 301 and also 201, getting her the benefit of doubt. Consequently, she was reinstated into  service but   back wages were denied, after conducting the  enquiry under  Kerala Service Rules. Rule 57 of the Rules provides that: ""An  Officer  who  is  detained  in custody,  whether   on  a  criminal charge or  otherwise, for  a period exceeding fortyeight  hours, or  is undergoing imprisonment,  shall  be deemed to  be under suspension with effect    from    the    date    of commencement of  the  detention  or imprisonment, as  the case  may be, and shall  not be  allowed to  draw any pay  and allowances during such period of suspension other than any subsistence  allowance   and  other allowances that  may be  granted in accordance with  Rule 55,  until he is reinstated in service."" Rule 56 of the Rules provides thus: ""(1) When  an officer  who has been dismissed,  removed  or  compulsory retired including  an  officer  who has been  compulsory retired  under rule 60A, is reinstated a result of appeal or review or would have been so   reinstated,    but   for   his retirement on  superannuation while under  suspension   or   not,   the authority   competent    to   order reinstatement  shall  consider  and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 make a specific order: (a)   regarding    the   pay    and allowances  to   be  paid   to  the officer  for   the  period  of  his absence  from  duty  including  the period of  suspension preceding his dismissal, removal,  or  compulsory retirement, as the case may be, (b) whether  or not the said period shall be  treated as a period spent on duty."" A reading  thereof would clearly indicate that where an officer has  been kept  under suspension,  on account of the pendency of the charges/detention for 48 hours and continued to remain under suspension pending the trial of the criminal charge, statutorily  he/she is  disabled    to  perform  the duties of  the post.  On reinstatement  under Rule  56,  the competent authority  shall have  a duty to consider whether, on reinstatement, suspended officer would be untitled to the payment of  full pay  etc. for the period of his suspension. The mandate  of Rule  56 is   the competent authority should consider the  case in accordance with the rules and pall the order. The  nature of  the order  is discretionary depending upon the  facts in  the case.  It is seen that on account of the involvement  of the  petitioner in  a criminal charge by statutory operation,  she was  under suspension till she was acquitted.  On   acquittal,  the  departmental  enquiry  was conducted as  to the  nature of  the order  to be made under Rule 56.  Accordingly, the  authority,  in  its  discretion, found that  the payment  of the  salary during the period of suspension except  suspension allowance  already paid, could not be granted. It being in accordance with the Rules, we do not think  that the  High  Court  has  committed  any  error warranting interference.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 2636 of 1979. From the  Judgment and  Order dated  25-4-1979  of  the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 822/77. Pramod Swarup (Amicus Curiae) for the Petitioner. H. R. Khanna and M. N. Shroff for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.-Shri Pramod Swarup appearing as amicus curiae has  presented the case of the accused as effectively as the  record permits. Indeed, he has gone to the extent of pressing into  service points  which do  not appear to us to have any  force. Moreover,  he has  tried to  persuade us to believe that  a dying  declaration made  by the lady who was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 burnt to  death by the husband-accused-that is the charge on which the  trial court  and the  High Court  have found  the petitioner guilty-is  exonerative of the accused-husband and does not  implicate him  as the  Court  has  construed.  The declarant as she was dying was 1210 conscious enough  to make  a statement  and in  one  of  the several statements  she made, it would appear, she said when her husband  was being  beaten up  that even  though she had been burnt,  her husband  should not  be beaten.  This is  a sentiment too  touching for  tears and stems from the values of the  culture of the Indian womanhood. A wife when she has been set fire to by her husband, true to her tradition, does not want  her husband  to be  assaulted brutally. It is this sentiment which prompted this dying tragic woman to say that even if  she was dying having been burnt, her husband should not  be  beaten.  We  are  unable  to  appreciate  how  this statement can  be converted  into  one  exculpative  of  the accused. Anyway,  we are mentioning these facts only because Shri  Pramod   Swarup  contended   that  they  were  weighty circumstances sufficient to cancel the conviction. Wife burning  tragedies are  becoming too  frequent for the  country   to  be   complacent.   Police   sensitisation mechanisms which  will prevent the commission of such crimes must be set up if these horrendous crimes are to be avoided. Likewise, special  provisions facilitating  easier proof  of such special  class of murders on establishing certain basic facts must  be provided  for by appropriate legislation. Law must  rise   to  the   challenge  of  shocking  criminology, especially when helpless women are the victims and the crime is committed  in the  secrecy of the husband’s home. We hope the State’s concern for the weaker sections of the community will be  activised into appropriate machinery and procedure. We dismiss the special leave petition. S.R.                                     Petition dismissed. 1",A dying declaration made by the lady who was. burnt to death by the husband-accused-that is the charge on which the trial court  and the High Court  have found  the petitioner guilty- is exonerative of the accused-husband and does not implicate him.

Although  nobody appears  for the respondents, notice must be deemed to  have been served on the respondents. 2.    Leave granted. 3.     This appeal by special leave arises from the order of Division  Bench of the Rajasthan High Court  dated  7.2.1994 made in Civil Appeal (Writ) No. 409 of 1992. 4.    The respondent had consignment of Rolling Mills in  63 cases, imported at the Port of Calcutta in October 1988  and got  unloaded  at  No. 3 shed, Netaji Subhas  Docks  of  the appellants  between October 11 to 17, 1988.  The  respondent No.  1 was required to obtain delivery of the goods  as  per the  prescribed  Scale of Rates but he failed to  have  them cleared  after  making  payment  of  demurrage.  He  made  a representation  on March 27, 1989 requesting the  appellants to  waive the port charges and release the goods. Since  the appellant  refused  to  do  so,  on  April  18,  1989,   the respondent  approached  the  District  Court  at  Bharatpur, Rajasthan  and  obtained an ex  parte  ad-interim  mandatory injunction  on 22nd April, 1989 directing the  appellant  to release  the goods within two days on payment of the sum  of Rs.  2,26,674.00 (Two lacs twenty six thousand, six  hundred and  seventy four only) being made while the respondent  was due in a sum of Rs. 7,37,400/- to the appellant. When the 31 appellant approached the High Court of  Rajasthan by way  of Civil Appeal (Writ),the High COurt dismissed the same. 5.      It is seen that the cause of action had  arisen   at Calcutta when the goods were imported and they were unloaded at     Shed No. 3, Netaji Subhas Docks of the appellant  and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the liability of payment had also arisen and on its  failure to  clear  the goods the respondent instituted the  suit  in District  Court  at  Bharatpur, Rajasthan. No  part  of  the cause  of action arose at Bharatpur. The appellant’s  office is  at Calcutta. Under s.20 CPC the only court competent  to take  cognizance of the action is the appropriate  court  at Calcutta. The order passed by the District Court,  Bharatpur in   the   suit  filed  by  the  respondent,    is   without jurisdiction and is void. when the appellant approached the High Court it has dismissed the case. Therefore High Court has committed manifest error of law in refusing to interface with such an abviously illigal and void order. Therefore, the impurgned order passed by the High Court of Rajasthan and district Court, Bharatpur are set aside. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. we have heard counsel on both sides. This appeal, by special leave, arises from the judgment of the Punjob & Haryana High Courtm made on March 7. 1996 in Second Appeal No.2662/95. The admitted  facts are that the respondent was charged for an offence under Section 302 I.P.C. He was convicted and sentenced to  undergo  imprisonment  for  life.  Thereafter, proceedings were  initiated against him under Article 311(2) of the  Constitution and he was removed from service. Appeal against his  conviction under Section 302 I.P.C. was allowed by the  High Court.  Punishment of  conviction under Section 302 IPC was modified to one under Section 325 IPC and he was directed to  undergo rigorous  imprisonment for 1-1/2 years. After undergoing  the imprisonment,  the respondent filed an appeal  before   the  appellate   authority.  The  appellate authority  by   order  dated   March  1,  1989  reduced  the punishment of  removal from  service to  lower scale  of pay drawn by  him and directed that he was not entitled to back- wages. The respondent accepted it and joined duty on June 5, 1989. Subsequently,  he filed  a civil  suit for declaration that his  dismissal from  the service  and reduction of rank and also  the direction  that he  is not entitled to pay the arrears of  wages, were  illegal, the  Addl. District  Judge reversed the  judgment of  the trial  Court and  decreed the suit. In the second appeal, the High Court has confirmed the same. Thus this appeal, by special leave. Learned counsel  for the  respondent contends  that the offence with  which he  was sentenced  under Section 325 IPC does not  involve his  moral turpitude  and, therefore,  the imposition of  punishment of  reduction of  his scale of pay and also  denial of  back wages, is clearly illegal and that the appellants  are not  entitled to challenge the order. We find no  force in  the  contention.  The  respondent  having accepted the order of the appellate authority and joined the post on  June 5,  1989, it  was not open to him to challenge the order  subsequently. By  his conduct he has accepted the correctness of the order and then acted upon it. Under these circumstances, the  civil Court would not have gone into the merits and decided the matter against the appellants. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Accordingly, the  appeal is  allowed.

" L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J J U D G M E N T S.  N.  VARIAVA, J. Leave granted.  Heard parties.  This Appeal is against an  Order  dated 29th March, 2000 by which an order  framing charges  under  Sections  302 and 304 of  I.P.C.   has  been quashed.   By the impugned Order the prosecution is directed to  be  proceeded  only under Section 304-A of  I.P.C.   and Section  39  of the Indian Electricity Act.  Briefly  stated the  facts are as follows:  2nd Respondent was possessing  a field  by the side of Shankar river.  2nd Respondent used to take  water  from  the  river to his  field  for  irrigation purposes.   2nd Respondent did not have electric connection. It  is claimed by the prosecution that he was taking illegal electric connection.  On 2nd May, 1999 a boy, named Santosh, who  was aged about 11 years, died due to electric shock  by coming  in  contact  with the live wire  through  which  2nd Respondent  was illegally taking electric connection.   Some persons  have given statements that the boy was swimming  in the  river  and the wire accidentally broke and fell in  the water  resulting  in  the boy being electrocuted.   On  this basis,  by the impugned Order prosecution is directed to  be proceeded  with  only for offences under Section 304  I.P.C. and  Section 39 of the Indian Electricity Act.  However, two eye witnesses, by name Haribai aged about 12 and Sandhya bai aged  about  7, have given statement to the police that  2nd Respondent  had  called the deceased Santosh to him and  had given  electric shock to the deceased on his chest and other parts of the body with the help of other accused.  The story given  by  the  two  eye witnesses is  that  thereafter  2nd Respondent  and other Accused have thrown the body into  the river  along  with the live wire.  It must be  mentioned  at this  stage that 5 burn injuries have been found on the dead body.   The  Trial  Court after considering  the  facts  and material framed charges under Sections 302 and 304 of I.P.C.@@ JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ and  Section  39  of the Indian Electricity Act.   The  High@@ JJJ Court,  in  Criminal  Revision, by the  impugned  Order  has proceeded  to disbelieve the evidence of the eye  witnesses. The  High Court has noted that, at this stage, the  evidence http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was  not  to  be weighed by the Court.  But the  High  Court holds that the Court could still assess the improbability or absurdity  of the statement of the eye witnesses.  The  High Court holds that the statements of the two witnesses Sandhya bai  and  Hari  bai were so absurd and  improbable  that  no prudent person could ever reach a just conclusion that there was sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused for offences  under Section 302 or Section 304 of the I.P.C.  In our  view, the High Court has committed a patent error.   As noted  by  the High Court itself, at this stage, it was  not open  for the Court to weigh or assess the evidence.  It was not  possible  for  the Court, at this stage, to come  to  a conclusion  that  this  evidence was  absurd  or  inherently improbable.   Prima  facie  at  least the  5  burn  injuries support the case that the boy was not just electrocuted by a live  wire  falling in the river in which he  was  swimming. They  prima facie suggest direct contact with the live wire. In  this  view  of the matter, we are of the view  that  the Order  of  the High Court cannot be sustained and it is  set aside.   The Appeal is accordingly allowed.  The Trial Court is  directed  to  proceed  with the trial on  the  basis  of charges framed by it.","The Appeal is against an Order dated 29th March, 2000 by which an order  framing charges under  Sections  302 and 304 of  I.P.C. has been quashed.

" J U D G E M E N T NANAVATI,J. The appellant  was convicted for the offence punishable under   Section 302 IPC by the Sessions Court, East Godavari Division,  in  S.C.  No.198  of  1994.  His  conviction  was confirmed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court. What has  been held  proved  against  him  is  that  on 2.8.1993 at  about 7.00  p.m., he  assaulted Lakshmi  with a knife and  killed her  on the spot. The prosecution case was that he  had developed illicit intimacy with Lakshmi and for about 8  to 9  years they had stayed together as husband and wife. Some  months before the date of incident , Lakshmi and the appellant  had separated  and since then she was staying in a  thatched  hut  near  the  hut  of  her  father.  After separating from  Lakshmi, the  appellant wanted  to join his first wife-Mariyamma  but Lakshmi  was creating obstacles in his way.  That was  the  reason  why  he  assaulted  her  on 2.8.1993. In order  to prove its case, the prosecution had relied upon the  evidence of  three  eye-witnesses.  PW-2  Polanati Nookaratnam did not support the prosecution and was declared a hostile  witness. Pw  1-Mariyamma, the  former wife of the appellant did  not support the prosecution fully and  merely stated that  at about  7.00 p.m. on the day of the incident, when  she saw PW 2 running on the road and asked her why she was running  like  that,  she  was  told  by  her  that  the appellant was beating Lakshmi. PW 3, the brother of Lakshmi, fully supported  the prosecution  case and  both the  courts below have  accepted his evidence. Relying upon his evidence and the  evidence of  recovery of  knife by  the accused  in presence of  the village  Administrative Officer  (PW 5) the trial court  convicted the  appellant. The  High Court  also believed the  evidence of  PW 3 and confirmed the conviction of the appellant. What was urged by the learned counsel for the appellant is that  the High  Court and  also the trial court failed to appreciate that  there was  no light  at the  place  of  the incident and,  therefore, PW 3 could not have identified the assailant of  Lakshmi. He  submitted that  it was raining on that day and as disclosed by the prosecution evidence it had http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 become dark  when the  incident had  happened. There were no electric lights  around  because  of  load  shedding.  That, however, cannot  mean that  there was no sufficient light at the time  of the  incident. The  evidence of  PWs  3  and  4 discloses that  the incident  had happened  near the shop of one Kapala  Bapiraju at a distance of about 10 feet. It  can be safely  assumed that  the shopkeeper would  not have kept his shop  open without  providing for  some other  source of light. Moreover,  the incident took place at about 7.00 p.m. and, therefore,  it is not possible to accept the contention that there must have been complete darkness at that time and PW 3  could not  have identified  the assailant.  It was not raining heavily.  There was movement of persons on the road. All these suggest that there was enough light and PW 3 could not have  found it difficult to recognise the appellant, who was none  other than  the person  with whom  his sister  had stayed for 8 to 9 years. We have  carefully scrutinised the evidence of PW 3 and we find  no infirmity in his evidence. His evidence receives support from  the evidence  of  the  Village  Administrative Officer, and  independent person, who was informed about the incident within  a very  short time.  As we  find  that  the appellant has  been rightly convicted under Section 302 IPC, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellant  was convicted for the offence punishable under   Section 302 IPC by the Sessions Court, East Godavari Division,  in S.C.

Choudhary, Advs. for the Respondents. The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the learned single Judge of the Calcutta High Court, made on May 18, 1981 dismissing the Civil Order No.1453/81. Smt. Maya  Datta had  purchased 1065  sq. ft.  of  land under sale  deed dated  February 19,  1976, after  the Urban Land (Ceiling of Regulation) Act, 1976 (for short the ""Act"") had  come   into  force,   from  Bangrur   Land  Development Corporation Ltd.,  a private  agency. She also had purchased some other  properties with  which we are not concerned. She applied for  permission under  Section 27(2)  of the Act for sale of  the building  constructed on  the land.  Though the competent authority  had refused  permission  under  Section 27(3) of  the Act, on appeal under Section 33, the appellate authority granted her permission which was questioned by the State in  the revision.  The High  Court dismissed the same. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It  is   not  clear  whether  Bangur  Land  Development Corporation Ltd.,  a private  agency was  in  possession  of excess vacant  land under the Act. The primary question that required to  be decided  by the  competent authority and the appellate authority was : whether the said agency was within the ceiling  limit computing  the land in question alienated to Smt.  Maya Datta.  If it  were to  be held  that the said agency was  in possession  of the  land within  the  ceiling limit, necessarily,  the sale  made in  favour of  Smt. Maya Datta in  question is  in accordance  with the  law. In that perspective, whether  Smt. Maya Datta was within the ceiling limit or not is not material. The permission, therefore, for alienation is required to be granted in the light of the law laid down  by this  Court in Maharao Sahib Shri Bhim Singhji Vs. Union  of India  & Ors.  [(1981) 1 SCC 1661]. Therefore, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the purchase  and grant of permission to Smt. Maya Datta, to that extent  become valid.  However, it  is left  open to be considered by the competent authority whether the alienation of the  land in  question to  Smt. Maya Datta, is subject to decision  by   the  competent  authority  that  Bangur  Land Development Corporation  Ltd. was  within the  ceiling limit equally of  Maya  Datta.  In  the  event  of  the  competent authority  deciding   that  the   Bangur  Land   Development Corporation Ltd.  was in  excess of the ceiling limit to the extent of  land sold  by that  authority to  the respondent, Smt. Maya  Datta would be required to be computed as part of the holding  of Bangur Land Development Corporation Ltd. and the purchaser  from Maya  Datta is also bound by it, equally of Maya  Dutta. Hence,  appropriate action is required to be taken against the said agency. With this  finding, the  appeal  is,  disposed  of.  No costs.","Smt.

Course in the trade of ’Fitter’.  Though the said inst itute was affiliated to the National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT), it was not affiliated in regard to the trade of ’Fitter’ during those years. 3.      In the prospectus issued by the Institute during the relevant years it was clearly represented as follows  : ""Those who complete ITI courses with not less than 80%  of attendance shall be eligible for appearing for the All India Examination conducted by NCVT. Those who successfully pass in the examination shall be issued the National Trade Certificates"". 4.      The appellants joined the course in view of the said specific representation held ou t by the State Government that on successful completion of the course, they will be entitled t o National Trade Certificates.  But when they completed the course, they were issued only provisional certificates, but were not issued the National Trade Certificates on the ground that the Institute was not affiliated in regard to the trade of Fitter.   They, therefore, f iled writ petitions  and the High Court, by the impugned judgment, declined to grant relief as the NCVT had not recognised the course in regard to the trade of fitter. 5.      Similarly situated persons who had been denied the National Trade Certificates had earlier approached the Kerala High Court in O.P.No.11534/1996, O.P.No.12982/2003 and W.P.(C)No.35549/2003 and High Court  directed the issue of the certificates. Those decisions became final and were complied with. 6.      Learned Addl.Solicitor General submitted that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, in particular the State Government having mentioned in the prospectus that the students who successfully complete the course would be issued National Trade Certificates and the earlier decisions in similar cases having been complied with, the NCVT would give National Trade Certificates in these cases also having validity all over the country.   The National Trade certificates will have to be issued to all the appellants as also the proforma respondents w http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ho were writ petitioners, within three months.  To expedite the process, the appellants and the proforma respondents are also permitted to submit applications with all relevant records to NCVT and on receipt of such applications, NCVT shall issue certificates to the eligible candidates/applicants within the period as mentioned above. Appeals are disposed of accordingly.

" JUDGMENT Rajendra Babu. J. This appeal is directed against an order made by the Central Administrative  Tribunal.    The respondent filed an application for re-fixation of his pay with effect from  1st Juanuary, 1986  in  the cadre of Divisional Accountant.  The Tribunal directed that the respondent be given the pay scale of Rs.  2000-3200 with effect from 1st Junary.  1986 in  the cadre of  Divisional accountant.  The Tribunal directed that the respondent be given the pay scale of Rs.  2000-3200 with effect from 1st January, 1986 till he  was  declared  to  be surplus  in  the organisation on the Project being wound up. The Tribunal noticed:   (i)  that  the  post  of  Divisional Accountant  is  higher in every respect other than that of a Senior Accountant; (ii) The Senior Accountants  were  always regarded  as assistants to the Divisional Accountants; (iii) That  Senior  Accountants  constitute  a  feeder  cadre   to promotion  to  Divisional  Accountant and some of the Senior Accountants appeared for examinations for promotion  to  the Divisional  Accountants  cadre  and  a candidate had to pass examination to become Divisional  Accountant  than  the  one precribed for becoming a Senior Accountant and the Third and Fourth Pay Commissionions had recommended higher  pay-scales for  Divisional  Accountants  compared to Senior Accountants and the Senior Accountants are junior to him. The Divisional Accountants  took  the  view  that  it   would   be   wholly incqui0able  alone  a Divisional Accountant who is higher in status than a Senior Accountant, to grant him salary  lesser than of Senior Accountant, on that basis given the direction referred to by us earlier. The  learned  Additional Solicitor General submitted that even  proceeding  on  the  basis  that  the  Divisional Accountant  is  higher  in  status  to  Senior Accountant, a direction issued by the Tribunal fixing the pay scale of the respondent is improbable.  He also contended that two  posts are  not comparable as Divisional Accountants are in line of promotion to Junior Accounts Officer of a lower cadre  alone whereas  Senior  Accountants  are  in  line for promotion to Establishment Officers with the higher pay scales. However, it is not possible for  us  to  decide  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 second  question  raised by the learned Additional Solicitor General. The Tribunal  has  on  consideration  of  different aspects of the matter to which we have adverted to has taken the view that Divisional Accountant is nigher in status than a  Senior  Accountant  which  is  a finding on a question of fact. On examination of the  duties  assigned  to  different persons  and  other  relevant circumstances the Tribunal has come to this conclusion.  Hence  we  do  not  think  we  can disturb that finding. However, the Tribunal could not  have  directed  fixing  the pay-scales of   the  respondent.    On  the  other  hand,  a direction should have been issued to the concerned authority to fix a proper  pay  scale  bearing  in  mind  the  finding recorded by the Tribunal that Divisional Accountants enjoy a higher status  to  that  of a Senior Accountant.  The appeal filed by the Government is,  therefore.    allowed  in  part modifying  the  direction  issued  by the Tribunal to give a particular pay scale of Rs.  2000-3200 with effect from  1st January,  1986,  on the other hand, the appellants shall fix appropriate pay scale bearing in mind the  finding  recorded by the  Tribunal  the Divisional Accountant.  We direct that the action be taken by the Government, for  the  respondent, within a period of six months from today.","This appeal is directed against an order made by the Central Administrative Tribunal.

" O R D E R This   review    petition   and   other   miscellaneous applications in  connection with  the review  petition  have been filed  out of  time. It has been filed by Satbir Singh, the maternal  grand-father of PW6 Satish, seeking for review of the judgment passed in Crl. Appeal No.650 of 1995. In  our   view,   the   review   application   is   not maintainable. In  Simranjit Singh  Mann vs.  Union of  India (1992 (4)  SCC 653),  this Court has held that a third party has no locus standi to challenge the conviction and sentence awarded  to  certain  convicts  even  on  the  averments  of violation of their fundamental rights. In IA  No.6/95 made  in Contempt  Petition  No.  234/95 (State of  Karnataka vs. I.R.  Dhananjaya), it has been held that the  review petition  filed by the State seeking review of the conviction and sentence of one of the officers of the State was  not maintainable.  The petitioner  in this review petition has  relied on  the decision  of this Court in S.P. Gupta vs.  President of  India (AIR  1992 SC  149)  and  has contended   that the  third party  like him  is competent to file the  present petition  for review.    Such  contention, however, cannot  be accepted.  In  S.P.  Gupta’s  case,  the petitioner  was   espousing  the  case  of  independence  of judiciary. The  present petitioner  is not  espousing such a cause, but  praying for  review of the judgment passed in an appeal preferred  by  the  convicted  appellants.  The  same stands entirely  on different  footing and, in our view, the petitioner has  no locus  standi  to  maintain  the  instant review petition. The review  petition and the miscellaneous applications are therefore dismissed.","Satbir Singh, the maternal  grand-father of PW6 Satish, seeking for review of the judgment passed in Crl.

The  High Court  by its  judgment and  order  dated August 31,1994  relying upon  Exs.P-5 to  P-8 and  the  sale deeds marked  thereof under Section 51-A of the Act enhanced the compensation to Rs.3/- per sq.ft. Thus, these appeals by special leave. It is  now well  settled legal  position as laid in the case of  P. Ram  Reddy &  Ors. vs. Land Acquisition Officer, Hyderabad Urban  Development  Authority,  Hyderabad  &  Ors. [(1995) 2  SCC 305]  followed by  catena of  other decisions that filing  of the  certified copies  of the sale deeds and marked thereor  under Section  51-A is  only to  enable  the claimants to  dispense with  the obligation,  to produce the original sale  deed from  the owners  who are disinclined to part with their valuable title deed during long pendency of: the proceedings. However, the claimants are enjoined to call as witnesses  the vendee or vendee to prove the transactions as genuine  in nature  and also  the extent of consideration paid and  relative nature of value of land as required under law. In  this case though the documents, Exs.P-5 to P-8 have been  marked,   none  of  the  persons  connected  with  the documents has been examined. Under these  circumstances, the  sale deeds  cannot  be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 relied on  to determine the compensation. The High Court and the Tribunal,  therefore, obviously committed grievous error of law  in relying  upon those  untested and  unproved  sale deeds in  determining the  compensation. The  award  or  the reference Court  and also  that of the High Court stands set aside. The  matter is  remitted to  the reference  Court for disposal in accordance with law. All the  appeals are allowed, out, in the circumstances without costs. Pursuant to  the interim  order passed by this Court on April 21,  1995, the respondents in C.A. SLP (C) Nos. 21466- 67/94 had  furnished the bank guarantee to the extent of the half of  the enhanced  compensation and  have withdrawn  the same. The  order would  continue  pending  disposal  of  the reference application  under  Section  18  of  the  Act  and depending upon  the award  that may  be passed,  appropriate direction  will   be  given,  by  the  reference  Court  for adjustment or recovery thereof.","Possession of the land was taken on August 25, 1980 dispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. Appellant was  temporarily appointed  in the Tamil Nadu Public Service  Commission itself  in the  year 1975-76, for regular recruitment,  she was  selected and appointed in the Finance Department  as a  Junior Assistance  in August 1990.

She was  asked to pass the same examination again after her  regular appointment, It would appear that she had requested a companion who was sitting by her side to keep an eye on  her answer  book and  also it  was  taken  that  she committed malpractice  in copying  the paper. On that ground the paper written by her in the year 1977 was also cancelled along with  the examination  in which she is imputed to have committed malpractice.  When she  challenged the  order, the High Court  held that since the examination passed by her in 1977 was  valid in  law, the  cancellation  thereof  on  the ground  of   her  committing   malpractice  in   the  second examination is  not valid  in law.  That  order  has  become final. Under  these   circumstances,  the  only  question  is: whether the  appellant’s service could be terminated for her failure to  pass the examination. No doubt, she did not pass the examination  after her  regular appointment  but she has passed the  examination when  she was temporarily in service and that order having been allowed to become final, it is no longer open  to the respondent to terminate her services for failure to  pass the examination. The respondent is directed to regularize  her  service  giving  her  past  benefits  of temporary service  with effect  from 1975-76  for purpose by perusal.

" JUDGMENT ORDER We have heard counsel for the parties. Leave granted. We have perused to order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay at Aurangabad whereby the accused-appellant was convicted under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/-, in default to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one year. The brief facts which are necessary for the disposal of this appeal are as under:- The prosecutrix Anita, aged about 18 years is the daughter of Arunabai and Ashruba. They are the residents of Chikhali, Taluka Patoda, District Beed and they are cultivators by profession. The appellant is the resident of the same village. The case of the prosecution is that the girl Anita was asked by her mother Arunabai to fetch water from a water bore situated in the school compound. On 23.7.2005 in the afternoon at about 3.00 P.M. Anita went with a steel pot to fetch water from the bore. The accused, whose house was by the side of the road, saw Anita and called  her. The accused told her that her father was in his house. Anita went close to the house and wanted  to know where her father was. The accused told her that her father was inside. The moment the girl Anita entered the house, the accused caught hold her and took her inside the house and bolted the door. The girl shouted for help but without any result. It is alleged that she was subjected to sexual intercourse by the accused. The accused was arrested, prosecuted and ultimately convicted by the Trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 376 IPC and was sentenced to suffer rigourous imprisonment for seven years and to pay fine of Rs. 4,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1-1/2 years. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Trial Court, an appeal was preferred before the High Court, The High Court partly allowed the appeal and convicted the appellant under Section 376 read with Section 511 IPC and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay fine of Rs. 5,000/- in default to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for one year. Hence the present Special Leave Petition. We have gone through the judgment of both the Courts below and also perused the necessary record. As per the evidence of the doctor, there was no injury on the body of the prosecutrix Anita. There was no sign of semen on the private part of the body. Neither her clothes were torn nor there was any presence of hair of the accused on the private part of the prosecutrix. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The doctor after examining the prosecutrix deposed that the girl was habituated to sexual intercourse. In view of this evidence, we are of the opinion that the High Court as well as the Trial Court has not correctly appreciated the evidence and has wrongly convicted the accused-appellant. The accused who has been charged under Section 376 read with Section 511 IPC is entitled to benefit of doubt. In the facts and circumstances of the case. we give the benefit of doubt to the appellant-accused as of the charges framed against him are not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court as well as of the Trial Court and acquit the accused of the charges levelled against him. This appeal is accordingly allowed. If the accused is in jail, he may be released forthwith if not required in any other case.","The case of the prosecution is that the girl Anita was asked by her mother Arunabai to fetch water from a water bore situated in the school compound.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2317 of 1969. From the  Judgment and  Order dated  29-8-1968  of  the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ No. 2713/68. N. N. Keswani for the Appellant. The Order of the Court was delivered by UNTWALIA, J.  In  this  appeal  filed  by  certificate, several points  have been  urged by  learned counsel for the appellant. We  do not  consider it necessary either to state all the  points or  discuss them  as none of them except one has got  any substance.  The point of substance which in our opinion must succeed in this appeal is as to whether even on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the face  of the Notification issued under Section 4 of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter called the Act), an Order under Section  17(4) dispensing with the compliance with the provisions of  Section 5A was validly made. The paragraph of the Notification which incorporated 94 apparently the  order exercising the power under Sub-Section (4) of Section 17 of the Act reads as follows:- ""Further in  exercise of the powers under the said Act, the  Governor of  Punjab is pleased to direct that action under  Section 17 shall be taken in this case on the grounds  of urgency  and provisions  of section  5A will not apply in regard to this acquisition."" It is  to be  clearly understood that under Sub-Section (4),  the   appropriate  Government   may  direct  that  the provision of Section 5A shall not apply where in the opinion of the  State Government,  the provisions of Sub-Section (1) or Sub-Section(2)  are applicable, otherwise not. For making the provisions  of Sub-Section  (1) applicable,  two  things must be  satisfied that  the land  in respect  of which  the urgency provision  is being  applied is  waste or arable and secondly that  there is  an urgency to proceed in the matter of taking immediate possession and so the right of the owner of the  land for filing an objection under Section 5A should not be  made  available  to  him.  In  the  portion  of  the Notification which  we have  extracted above,  it is neither mentioned that  the land  is waste or arable nor has it been stated that  in the opinion of the Government, there was any urgency to  take recourse to the provisions of Section 17 of the Act. A direction to the Collector has been given to take action under Section 17 on the ground of urgency but this is not a  legal and  complete fulfillment of the requirement of the law.  It is  to be remembered that the right of a person having any  interest in  the property  to file  an objection under Section 5A of the Act should not be interfered with in such a  casual or  cavalier manner  as has been done in this case. For the  reasons stated above, we allow this appeal set aside the order of the High Court dismissing the appellant’s writ Petition,  allow the writ Petition and strike down that portion  of  the  Notification  issued  on  23-8-1967  under Section 4  of the  Act which  directed the exercise of power under Section  17.  The  authorities,  if  so  advised,  may proceed further in the matter after giving an opportunity to the appellant of filing their objection under Section 5A. Since the  other side  has not  appeared, there  is  no order as to costs. N.V.K.                                       Appeal allowed. 95","The appeal was filed by N. N. Keswani for the Appellant.

" JUDGMENT 2003 Supp(2) SCR 839 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The appellant herein is a society registered under the Madhya Pradesh Co- operative Societies Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""). On 17.12.1993 and 8.2.1994, the appellant herein entered into agreements with the General Manager, Government Milk Scheme, Nagpur/Akola for supply of milk. These agreements were executed at Nagpur. Condition No. 19 of the said agreements provided that the disputes between the parties shall be referred to an arbitrator, i.e. the Dairy Development Commissioner, Bombay, Maharashtra. Subsequently, the appellant-Society moved an application under Section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 for quashing condition No. 19 whereby the arbitration was to be done by the Dairy Development Commissioner, Bombay, Maharashtra. The learned District Judge was of the opinion that in view of Section 64 of the Act, condition No. 19 of the agreement was erroneous and, therefore, the same was set aside and the application was allowed. Aggrieved, the respondents filed an appeal before the High Court. The High Court was, inter alia, of the view that since the agreements were entered into beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the appellant, that is outside the State of Madhya Pradesh, Section 64 of the Act was inapplicable and, therefore, the High Court set aside the order of the learned District Judge and allowed the appeal. It is against the said judgment, the appellant is in appeal before us. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that the view taken by the High Court was erroneous. We do not find any merit in this contention. It is not disputed that the agreements were entered into and executed at Nagpur which is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Madhya Pradesh Section 1 of the Act provides that the provisions of the Act would be applicable to the whole of Madhya Pradesh Since the operation of the Act is intra-State and cannot be applied beyond the territory of the State of Madhya Pradesh, it must be held that Section 64 of the Act is not applicable. In T.K. Sundaram v. The Co-operative, Sugars Ltd., Chittoor, AIR (1988) Madras 167, it was held thus: ""8. The next question raised on behalf of the appellant is that the suit is barred under the provisions of the Kerala Co- operative Societies Act, and as such the suit ought to have been dismissed. This argument is based upon the arbitration provision contained in the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act. But the contract has been entered into in Tamil Nadu and the same is enforceable in Tamil Nadu. As such with reference to the contract entered into the Tamil Nadu, and enforceable in Tamil Nadu provisions of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act cannot be applied. Under the circumstances, both the courts below are rights in negativing the contention, relating to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 jurisdiction. Applying the principle laid down above, we find that since the agreements in the present case were entered into and executed in the State of Maharashtra, Section 64 of the Act is not applicable and, therefore, the view taken by the High Court was correct. We find no merit in the appeal. It is, accordingly, dismissed. No costs. Learned counsel appearing for the arbitrator (respondent No. 3 herein) furnished before us a copy of the award in a sealed cover. Since we have already disposed of the matter, it will be open to the arbitrator to file the same before the appropriate court.","Society entered into agreements with the General Manager, Government Milk Scheme, Nagpur/Akola for supply of milk.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. The State  has filed  this appeal  as the High Court of Kerala acquitted  the respondents  by  setting  aside  their convictions under  Sections 5  (2) and  5  (1)  (d)  of  the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Sections 109 and 120- B of  the Indian  Penal Code. Alongwith the two respondents, two others  were also  tried for  the said  offences in  the court of  the Special  Judge, Trichur,  in Criminal Case No. 18/82. Smt. Bitchu  - A.2  was the  owner of  M/s. Latex India Ltd. and M/s. Excellent Rubber and Allied Industries. But as a matter  of fact,  both the  industries were managed by her husband Abdulla koya A.3. The prosecution case was that A.2 and A.3 in conspiracy with  Anandan   -  A.1,  who  was  the  District  Industries officers, and  A.4, who  was a Technical Supervisor, entered into a conspiracy to obtain for A.2 and A.3 more quantity of Titanium dioxide  than what  was really required by them for their industries and pursuant to that conspiracy A.1. issued two Essentiality  Certificates, Ex.  P. 35(a)  and  P.36(a), entitling M/s.  Latex India  Ltd. to  get 300  kilograms  of Titanium Dioxide per month and M/s. Excellent and Rubber and Allied Industries  to get 2000 kilograms of Titanium dioxide per Month.  In substance,  the allegation  against them  was that this much quantity of titanium dioxide was not required by them  and A.1 - Anandan abusing his official position had wrongly  issued  the  two  Essentiality  Certificates  which entitled them to obtain more titanium dioxide which entitled them to  obtain more  titanium dioxide which  could later be sold in the market at a higher price. The trial  court relied  upon the evidence of PW 4, who was the Deputy Director (Controls), PW 7 - Narayanan Nambiar and PW  17 -  PR Pillai,  the commercial Manager and the two documents -  P.35 (c)  and P.35  (d) and  held that A. 1 had issued the  said Essentiality  Certificates fro  much  lager quantity than  that required by A.2 and A.3.  As A.2 was not taking any  interest in  the management  of the two concerns and  as   A.4  had   not  taken  any  part  in  issuing  the Essentiality certificates,  they were  acquitted but A.1 and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A.3 came to be convicted for the offences mentioned above. The High  court on reappreciation of the evidence found that there  was nothing  to show that titanium dioxide was a scare commodity  or that  its distribution  and  price  were controlled. it  also came  to the  conclusion that  there is nothing on  the record  to show  that the said two firms did not require  that much  quantity for  their  use.  The  High Court, therefore,  allowed the appeal and acquitted both the respondents. We have  gone through  the judgments of the trial court and the  High Court  and also the relevant evidence. We find that the  prosecution had not led any evidence to prove that titanium  dioxide   was  a  scarce  commodity  or  that  its distribution and  price were  controlled  by  any  statutory provision or  an administrative order. We also find that the prosecution had  failed to  establish that  in 1969 when the two certificates  were issued, the two factories were either closed or that they did not require the quantity of titanium dioxide  for   which  they  had  obtained  the  Essentiality Certificates. In absence of such evidence, it cannot be said that by  issuing the Essentiality Certificates, Ex. P. 35(a) and Ex.  P. 36(a).  A.1 had  abused its official position in any manner.  The High  court was,  therefore,  justified  in acquitting both the respondents. We, therefore,  dismiss these  appeals. Bail  bonds are ordered to be cancelled.",Smt.

" O R D E R Though notice  was served on the legal heirs of the 1st respondent and  the counsel who had appeared earlier and had taken time  has now  reported that  in spite  of his writing three letters,  there is  no response  from them.  The legal heirs are brought on record. Leave granted. The only question that arises for consideration in this case is:  which article  of Schedule  to the Limitation Act, 1963 (for short, the ’Act’) would be applicable to the facts in this  case? The  courts below found as a fact that though the sale  deed was  executed on  July 12, 1966 by Asha Kaur, the first  respondent in favour of one Ganesh Missir, it was found that Ganesh Missir had played fraud upon her and that, therefore, the  sale deed is vitiated by fraud. She remained in possession  till December  14, 1970  and, therefore,  the sale deed  does not  bind her.  She filed a suit against the defendants including the appellants who came to have another sale deed  dated December  14, 1970  pursuant to  which  the plaintiff was  sought to be dispossessed. She filed the suit within three  years for adjudication under Section 31 of the Specific Relief  Act that  the sale  deeds are  void and for injunction  when  she  was  sought  to  be  dispossessed  on February 15,  1973 under  the sale  deed. It  was  also  her contention that  the second  sale deed  also was vitiated by fraud because  of her  incapacity and  illiteracy. That also found favour  with the  courts below  and  the  High  Court. Accordingly, her suit came to be decreed. It is  contended by the appellants that whatever may be the finding regarding the sale deed of 1966, there cannot be any second  fraud in  the case of second sale deed. The suit ought to have been filed under Article 58 of the Schedule to the Act  and not  under Article  34. We find no force in the contention. In  view of  the finding  recorded by the courts below as a finding of fact that a fraud was played upon her, the fraud  unravels the  entire transaction  to  be  a  void document. Therefore,  the limitation starts running from the date when  the  cause  of  action  had  arisen,  viz.,  when dispossession was  sought to  be made.  It is  seen that the first respondent was sought to be dispossessed from her land http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 in 1973.  The sale  deed came  to be  executed within  three years from  the date.  Under these  circumstances, since she remained in  possession till  that date, there is no need to file a  suit under  Article 59  of the  Schedule of the Act. Therefore, the  suit was  rightly filed  within three  years under Article  58 of  the Schedule to the Act and the courts below decreed  it  and  the  High  Court  upheld  the  same. Accordingly it does not warrant interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" THE 10TH DAY OF MAY, 1995 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.M.Sahai Hon’ble Mr. Justice S.B.Majmudar Mr.H.L.Srivastava, Mr.S.M.Rai, Mr.B.M.Sharma, Mr.T.N.Singh, Advs. for the appeallant Mr.B.B.Singh, Adv. for the Respondents. O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5791 OF 1995 [Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4422 of 1991] Fakruddin V. The Principal, Consolidation Training Institute & Ors. O R D E R Leave granted. Justice should  not only  be done  but seem to be done. That is the basic structure on which confidence and faith in the institution  rests. The judiciary from the bottom in the hierarchy to the apex at the top commands respect because of its impartiality  and objectivity.  When a  judge directs  a case to be listed before another Court or Bench, as he knows one or  the other party, it is not because any statutory law precludes him from hearing and deciding it but the propriety is practised  and observed  to  exclude  even  the  remotest possibility of any misgiving or doubt about the impartiality of the judge as even if he is just and fair and his decision is correct yet it may not be satisfying. What happened  in this case is not only unfortunate but to compound  it further the learned Judge even when apprised that he  was the  counsel for  the respondent when he was at the bar  did not observe that minimum norm which is expected http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to be observed even by quasi-judicial authorities. The  dispute   related  to   allotment  of  ’Chaks’  in consolidation proceedings. Such a dispute does not raise any question of  title. No  exception, therefore, could be taken to the  order passed  by the  High Court dismissing the writ petition in  limine. But  what has compelled us to interfere with the order of the High Court is that it was decided by a Bench of  which one  of the  judges was  a counsel  for  the respondents before  his elevation.  It may  happen at  times that a  judge who  had  appeared  for  a  party  before  his elevation may  have forgotten  about it.  An order passed in ignorance of  such factual error may not be taken notice of. But where it was specifically pointed out, as claimed in the Special Leave  Petition, that the learned Judge was apprised of it  and yet  he chose  to decide  the  case,  is  neither justified nor healthy for the institution. The result of the decision is  immaterial. May  be that  another Bench hearing the case  may have  come to  same conclusion.  In fact  this Court  might  have  refused  to  interfere  with  the  order relating to  allotment  of  ’Chakas’,  but  it  is  not  the correctness or  otherwise of  the order  but  the  sense  of justice, the  public glare in which a judge is exposed every moment which  is more important. A decision of a case one or other way may affect an individual but a decision by a judge who had  appeared for one of the parties irrespective of the stakes,  the   result  and   the  consequences  is  of  much significance  from   a  social  point  of  view.  Therefore, irrespective of  the merits  of the  case we  set aside  the order passed  by the  High Court  and remit the case back to the  High   Court  for  deciding  it  afresh  on  merits  in accordance with  law. Any  observation made  in  this  order shall not be taken as deciding the rights of parties. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

" ORDER Leave granted. In respect of the Assessment Years 1978-79,  1979-80 and  1980-81  returns  were  filed  by the respondent, after search and seizure had taken place under Section 132 of  the Income-tax   Act.  Returns  were  filed  belatedly  and  the assessments which were made were at a figure more than  what was the returned income. Prosecution  was  launched  against  the respondent alleging that he had committed an offence under Section 276-C of  the said  act,  since  his returns had been filed much after the date of search and he had wilfully attempted  to  evade  tax chargeable or imposable under the Act. The respondent thereafter moved an application under section 482  before  the  Allahabad  High  Court.    It  was contended before the Court that  the  assessment  which  was made was on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the respondent and the Income-tax Commissioner, Kanpur and there was  also  an  understanding  that  no penal action would be taken against the respondent.  A  further  contention  which was  raised  was  that before any prosecution is launched an opportunity of hearing should  have  been  afforded.    This contention  was  sought  to  be  raised  on the basis of the respondent’s interpretation  of  sub-section(2)  of  Section 279. The  High  Court  came  to  the  conclusion that the assessment made was in pursuance of a  mutual  understanding therefore  no  penal  action  could  be  taken  against  the respondent  and,  further,  that  he  was  not  afforded  an opportunity  to  compound  the  matter  under Section 279(2) prior to the institution of the  prosecution  and  therefore it’s initiation was not valid. In  our  opinion  the  decision of the High Court is clearly without any legal basis.  Firstly, it appears to  be undisputed  that there was a delay in filing of the returns. There does not seem to be an averment in the petition  under Section  482, and certainly no discussion by the High Court, to the fact that the Income disclosed was much less than the income assessed.   Furthermore,  there  is  nothing  on  the record  which  could  lead  the High Court to the conclusion http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that any understanding was given to the respondent  that  no penal action  could  be  taken.  The learned counsel for the respondent is also unable  to  draw  our  attention  to  any provision   of  the  Income-tax  Act  whereby  a  compromise assessment could have been arrived at between the respondent and the Commissioner of Income-Tax.  The High Court, in  our view,  was clearly in error in proceeding to accept the said contention of  the  respondent’s  counsel.    The   question whether  there was any understanding or not even if it could have been there, is one of the fact which will  have  to  be proved before the Trial Court. We further find that sub-secton(2) of Section 279 is a  provision  which  enables  the  Chief Commissioner or the Director General to compound any offence  either  before  or after  the institution of proceeding. There is no warrant in interpreting  this  sub-section  to  mean  that  before  any prosecution is launched either a show cause notice should be given or an opportunity afforded to compound the matter. The enabling  provision cannot give a right to a party to insist on the Chief Commissioner or the Director General to make an offer of compounding before the prosecution is launched. The  decision  of  the  High   Court   is   clearly untenable.  The  same  is  accordingly  set  aside  and  the application under Section 482 filed by the respondent before the High Court would accordingly stand dismissed. The Trial Court is now directed to proceed with  the case in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible. The appeals are allowed. Leave granted.","In respect of the Assessment Years 1978-79,  1979-80 and  1980-81  returns  were filed by the respondent, after search and seizure had taken place under Section 132 of the Income-tax   Act.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 4441-4442 of 2005) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the application to recall the order dismissing the Second Appeal. The background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Appellant filed Second Appeal No.4802/2003 before the High Court questioning correctness of the order passed by a learned Second Additional District Judge, Kapurthala.  By the said order the first Appellate Court affirmed the order of the learned Civil Judge, Junior Division, Kapurthala. The matter was listed on 8.11.2004. On that day there was no appearance on behalf of the appellant. The High Court referred to the merits of the case and dismissed the appeal noting that none appeared for the appellant. It is to be noted that the appeal was filed by the defendants. An application in terms of Order XLI Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the ’Code’) read with Section 151 of the Code was filed to restore the appeal for deciding the same on merits. It was indicated in the application for restoration as to why there was non- appearance on the date fixed. In the application it was categorically stated that the matter was listed at item No.260 before the learned Single Judge. When the matter was called learned counsel for the appellant was arguing another matter before a Bench of Hon’ble the Chief Justice. In the case at hand respondents were yet to put appearance. So the assisting counsel was instructed to attend the Court to note the next date.   By the time the assisting counsel reached the Court, the matter had already been taken up and dismissed for want of prosecution.  It is submitted that the High Court did not take note of the aforesaid factual aspects and on the contrary dismissed the application for restoration on the ground that the matter was decided on merits. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that since the matter had been decided on merits there was no http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 scope for recalling the order. It is to be noted that in the application for restoration the reasons for non appearance at the time when the matter was taken up had been indicated. It was noted that the matter was fixed for filing of the vakalatnama of the respondents. There was unintentional absence and the reason for the same was  indicated. The High Court has not found the reason indicated to be in any manner incorrect or untrue. Merely because the appeal has been dismissed on merits that could not have been a ground to refuse restoration of the appeal. As rightly contended by learned counsel for the appellant the reason for non appearance when the matter was taken up had been indicated. There is no dispute that the factual scenario as projected by the appellant was the correct one. Mere fact that the appeal was dismissed on merits could not have been a ground to refuse restoration. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct restoration of the Second Appeal. The appeals are allowed. There will be no order as to costs.","Appellant filed Second Appeal No.4802/2003 before the High Court questioning correctness of the order passed by a learned Second Additional District Judge, Kapurthala.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.   The  notification  under  section  4(1)  of  the   Land Acquisition  Act was published on August 11, 1971  acquiring about 700 acres of land in Golabandha Buxi Palli,  Vikrampur in Ganjam District of Orissa State.  By his award dt.   June 22, 1974, the Land Acquisition Officer determined the market value.    On  reference  under  section  18,   the   learned Subordinate  Judge confirmed the award of the  Collector  by his award and decree dt.  January 31, 1985.  The  appellants did  not carry the matter in appeal.  When others filed  the appeal  under section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act  before the High Court, the High Court enhanced the compensation  to the  fruit bearing trees at Rs. 990/- and Rs. 650/- for  not fruit  bearing  trees by its judgment dt.  April  21,  1992. Thereafter  the  appellants  filed  the  application   under section  28-A  of the Land Acquisition Act on  November  21, 1992  for  redetermination.  The  Land  Acquisition  Officer dismissed the application and thereof, the High Court by its order  dt.  April 30, 1993 confined the same in  O.J.C.  No. 24/93.  Thus this appeal by special leave. 3.   It is contended that when the High Court awarded higher compensation  by operation of section 28-A of the  Land  Ac- quisition Act, the appellants also are entitled to the  same benefit. The point is now squarely covered by two  judgments of  this Court in Scheduled Castes Co-operative Land  Owning Sociely Ltd., Bhatinda v. Union of India & Ors. reported  in AIR 1991 SC 738 and Babua Ram & Ors. v. State of UP. &  Anr. reported in JT 1994 (7) SC 377.  Therefore, the  application under sec. 28-A is not maintainable.  The Collector and  the High  Court rightly refused to grant the amount on par  with the judgment of this Court. 4.   The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R We have  heard the counsel for both the parties at some length. We  have been  taken through  the  three  agreements concern herein,  the orders  of the  Government of India and the Judgment  of the  Tribunal under appeal. We are inclined to  agree  with  the  Tribunal  that  the  three  agreements represent a  single transaction  between the  appellant  and Davy Mckee  (London ) Limited, U.K. and that they are in the nature of  a package  deal. It may be that all the equipment that  was  contemplated  to  be  purchased  abroad  was  not purchased and  that some of it was locally procured but what was imported  was specially  manufactured on  the  basis  of design and  engineering specifications  provided by Davy. We are of  the opinion  that the  Tribunal was tight in holding that the  agreement relating to purchase of equipment cannot be dissociated  from  the  other  agreements  and  that  the authorities were right in loading the design and engineering charges at  Pounds 11.50  lakhs  on  to  the  value  of  the imported equipment  under Rule  9 read  with Rule  4 of  the Customs Valuation Determination of Price of Imported (goods) Rules, 1988.

Nos. 11701-11727/2000 & W.P. No. 10723/2000. 2.      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 3.      The appellants before us filed O.A. Nos. 1040/1998, 1055-1081/1998 etc.  before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Bangalore Bench seeking a direction to quash Rule 6(4)(a) of the Defence Research & Development Organization, Technical Cadre Recruitment Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the \021Rules\022) as being violative of Article 14 & 16 of the Constitution, and for a direction to place the applicants/appellants in grade II of category II with effect from 26.8.1995 with all consequential benefits. 4.      The applicants (appellants before us) were Chargemen grade II in the service of the Union of India, Ministry of Defence.  The Union of India introduced the aforesaid Rule on 26.8.1995. We are, however, only concerned with Rule 6(4)(a) which states as under: \023(4)  (a).  All persons holding the posts of Chief Glass Blower, Artist-cum-Photographer, Commercial Artist, Junior Scientific Assistant Grade I, Chargeman Grade II and Draughtsman Grade II shall be placed in grade 2 of category II provided that they possess the qualifications prescribed for recruitment to the grade of Technical Assistant \021A\022 as laid down in Schedule III failing which they shall be placed in grade 4 of category I. NOTE:  For this purpose, the existing incumbents of the posts of Draughtsman Grade II, possessing a certificate or a diploma in Draughtsmanship of a minimum duration of one year shall be deemed to possess the required qualifications\024 5.      A perusal of Rule 6(4)(a) shows that those Chargemen who possess the qualifications prescribed in Schedule III shall be placed in grade 2 of category II while those who do not possess the same will be placed in grade 4 of category I. 6.      Admittedly, the applicants/petitioners did not possess the qualifications in Schedule III to the Rules and hence they were placed in grade IV of category I.  Their  grievance is that they have been discriminated against because before coming into force of the Rules in 1995 all Chargemen grade II were in the same category, while now under Rule 6(4)(a) the erstwhile Chargemen grade II have been divided into two http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 categories, namely, those who possess the qualifications in schedule III and those who do not. 7.      Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that this is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution because chances of promotion of the appellants have been adversely affected. 8.      We regret we cannot agree.  It is well settled by a series of decisions now that there can be categorization on the basis of educational qualifications.  The erstwhile Chargemen grade II who had the qualifications mentioned in Schedule III have been placed in a higher category while those like the appellants who do not have the said qualifications have been placed in the lower category.  In our opinion, there is no violation of Article 14 on such a categorization. 9.      It is well settled that categorization can be done on the basis of educational qualifications and there will be no violation of Article 14 if this is done. 10.     Learned counsel for the appellants then submitted that the Draughtsmen grade II have been placed better off by the Note to Rule 6(4)(a) vis-‘-vis the erstwhile Chargemen grade II who did not have the qualifications in Schedule III. 11.     In our opinion, this submission too has no merit.  It is well settled that Article 14 applies within the same class.  Draughtsman and Chargeman are two different classes, and hence there is no question of discrimination between them. 12.     For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in these appeals. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.  No order as to costs.","Appellants before us were Chargemen grade II in the service of the Union of India, Ministry of Defence.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) NO. 3802 OF 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dismissing the application filed by the appellants in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short ’Cr.P.C.’).  The prayer was to quash the proceedings in CC No. 2/2006 on the file of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, City Criminal Courts at Hyderabad.  The State of Andhra Pradesh represented by Special Public Prosecutor filed a complaint under Section 200 read with Section 199 Cr.P.C. stating that with a common intention intending to harm the reputation of the Government, of its administration, of the Chief Minister, several minister and several public servants made a telecast on E TV-2 channel with commentary knowing fully that the same would harm reputation of public functionaries. The voice over the commentary was that of the appellant no.2.  Many expressions and words used in  commentary are per se defamatory.  The appellants filed a petition in terms of Section 482 Cr.P.C.  The stand was that the complaint was nothing but gross abuse of process of Court.  The respondent opposed the application stating that on the facts alleged no interference in terms of Section 482 Cr.P.C. was called for. With reference to Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short ’IPC’) the High Court dismissed the application, holding that a prima facie case existed and, therefore, no interference was called for. Though many points were urged in support of the appeal, leaned counsel for the appellants submitted that actually there was no intention in any manner to harm reputation of the Chief Minister, of the Ministers or the officials and, therefore, continuance of the proceedings would not be in public interest. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that after showing the Chief Minister, ministers and the public officials in poor light,  the appellants cannot take the plea of innocence. After hearing learned counsel at some length, we think http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that public interest would be best served in directing  following broadcast to be  made in the concerned TV channel by the appellants  within a period of one week from today. The telecast would be as follows:- ""A news telecast had been made by the channels E TV-2 on 22.11.2005 covering the visit of the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh alongwith some of his ministers and officials to Putta Parthi Sai Baba. The voice over commentary for the said telecast was provided by Smt. Kalyani.  It is clarified on behalf of channel E TV-2 that the content of the voice over commentary was not intended in any manner to defame or harm the reputation of the Chief Minister or his entourage of ministers and officials.  If it has been construed that way, it is clarified that same was not the intent and purpose of the broadcast."" Learned counsel for the appellants has stated that to show the bonafides  the appellants shall make the necessary broadcast within the time indicated. Learned counsel for the parties have agreed that all proceedings relating to the broadcast shall be withdrawn and shall not be pursued.

" JUDGMENT 1994(1) SCR 697 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. 1.  Heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals arise out of the order dated August 4, 1992 of the Division Bench in Civil Writ Petition No. 17600 of 1991 etc. The admitted facts are that the appellant-State had requisitioned to the Sub-ordinate Selection Committee to recruit by direct recruitment 11 candidates to the post of Chief Inspectors. They have categorised the vacancies as under: - 6 posts for General Candidates 2 posts for Scheduled Caste 1 post for Backward Class 2 posts for Ex-serviceman While selecting 11 candidates the Committee also kept four more candidates in the waiting list. The respondents stand at SI. Nos. 8 to 11. They admittedly belong to the general category. 2. The High Court while disposing of the matter held that keeping the candidates in the waiting list does not create any right in their favour in the posts, but if the appellant for administrative exigencies fill up the post on ad hoc basis then it is open to the appellants to appoint the candidates waiting in the list in the order or merit. The contention of Ms. Indu Malhotra, learned counsel for the State, is that the list had elapsed by efflux of time of one year and the candidates who were waiting in the list have no right to claim for appointment. The High Court is, therefore, not right in directing appointment of candidates in the waiting list in the order of merit. It is true that the waiting list will be valid only for one year and on the expiry thereof the waiting list shall stand lapsed; but what the High Court appears to have directed was that in the event of any ad hoc appointments being made to any existing vacancies, de hors the rule, the respondents will be considered for ad hoc appointment since their-names are in the select list, provided the Government chooses to make such appointment. 3. We do not find any illegality in the observations of the High Court. It is one of option to the appellants. It the appellants do not make any appointments to the posts, the question of considering the claims of the waiting list candidates does not arise. In the event of the appellants’ choosing to make appointments on ad hoc basis, then certainly the can- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 didates in the waiting list, though it lapsed, must be considered for appoint-ment de hors the Rules which may not confer any right on them for future recruitment It is only an enabling direction to make temporary appoint-ment pending regular recruitment. 4. It is needless to mention that the respondents being the general candidates will be considered only against the quota reserved for general candidates.",The High Court held that keeping the candidates in the waiting list does not create any right in their favour in the posts.

On an application being made in Form 37(I) before  the Appropriate Authority as required under  Section 269  UC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [hereinafter referred to as  the Act], the Appropriate Authority proceeded to  take into  consideration three instances of sale made in  respect of  property  bearing  No.B-1/16, Hauz Khas,  New  Delhi  in February 1987;  of property bearing NO.J-10, Green Park, New Delhi  and B-2/2, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhii in February 1987.   The  average of three sale instances was taken  into account  to  work  out the land rate of Rs.7,850/-  per  sq. mtr.  and it was concluded that the fair market value of the property  in  question was over the  apparent  consideration disclosed  by  28.5  per cent.  On that basis  proceeded  to acquire  the property for the Union of India, rejecting  the explanation  offered by the transferor that he was desperate to  sell the property in order to go abroad and settle  with his only daughter in U.S.A.  and that the sale instances are of  incomparable  properties  in  different  areas  and  the adjustment  can  arise  in  cases   where  there  is   basic similarity  between  two properties.  However these  reasons appealed to the High Court on challenge made to the order of acquisition  and the same was quashed.  Hence this appeal by special leave. The  High  Court in examining the matter has  considered the  various aspects in true perspective.  The value of  the property either with reference to the apparent consideration or  the  fair  market value determined  by  the  Appropriate Authority  is  not  of  such magnitude as to  call  for  any interference.   We  are of the view that this is not  a  fit case in which interference is called for. The appeal, therefore, stands dismissed.

By proceedings dated October  31, 1985,  the Government had stated that the underlying idea  to introduce  the scheme  was to  help  the bereaved family of a deceased employee immediately by way of providing  employment  to  one  dependent  of  the  deceased Government employee  in addition  to ex-gratia  payment etc. The Government  in an earlier Circular dated 9th March, 1979 had stated  that the  Government took  the decision that the family members of the employee, who died while in service or retired due  to disability,  would be  given the facility of employment. Accordingly  directions  were  given.  The  word ’family’ has  been defined  under Rule  6.16-B  (a)  of  the Punjab Civil  Services Rules,  Vol. III  applicable  to  the Government of Haryana which reads thus: ""6.16-B. (1)  For the  purpose  of  this rule:- [a]""family"" shall  include the following relatives of the Officer- (i) Wife, in case of male officer; (ii) Husband, in case of female officer; (iii)Sons; [including  stepchildren  and adopted Children] (iv) unmarried  and  widowed  daughters; [including  step-children   and  adopted children] (v) brothers  below the age of 187 years http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and  unmarried   and  widowed   sisters, including step-brothers and sisters; (vi) Father; [including adoptive parents in case of (vii) Mother; individuals whose personal law permits adoptional (viii) married daughters; and (ix) Children of a pre-deceased son. A reading  of this Rule would clearly indicate that for the purpose  of the  above rules ’family’ includes the wife, in the case of male officer,husband, in the case of a female officer, sons,  unmarried and  widowed daughters  [including step children  and adopted  children, brothers below the age of 18  years and  unmarried and  widowed sisters  [including step-brothers  and   sisters,  father,   mother   [including adoptive parents  in case  of individuals whose personal law permits adoption],  married daughters and children of a pre- deceased son.  It would  thus be  seen that in the case of a brother, he  will he  a member of the family as dependent if he is  below 18  years. If  he seeks  employment  under  the rules, he  cannot be  appointed if  he is below 18 years and has not  become major. The moment he crosses 18 years, he no longer remains  to be  the dependent member cf the family of the deceased Government employee. Shri Prem  Malhotra, learned  counsel appearing for the respondent has stated that previously they had appointed the brother  of   the  deceased   employee  and,therefore,   the Government is  stopped by contending that the brother is not a dependent of the deceased Government employee. It might be that some  Department had wrongly given the benefit but such wrong  action   cannot  become   right,  in   the  face   of specifically unambiguous  language in  which the  rules  are couched. Under  these circumstances,  the High Court was not right in  giving direction  to appoint  the brother  of  the deceased on compassionate grounds. The appeal  is allowed  accordingly. If  the  widow  of respondent’s brother is eligible for employment, it would be open to  her to  make an  application and  the Department is directed to consider her application according to the rules. No costs.","The High Court of Punjab and Haryana by order dated December 30, 1993 in C.W.P. No.8419/93 directed appointment of the  brother of the deceased employee.

By order  dated December 4, 1995, this Court had issued notice and  directed interim  stay of  the execution  of the awards, subject  to the  condition that  the appellant would pay 50%  of the  enhanced compensation.  We are  informed by Shri Goswami, learned senior counsel for the appellant, that the order  has been  complied with. On the other hand, it is contended for  the respondents  that the  deposit 50% of the amount was  not in  terms of  the decree  of  the  reference Court. Be it as it may, the appellant is directed to deposit 50% of the enhanced compensation as awarded under Section 26 of the  Land Acquisition  Act, 1894  in the decree and award which is  the subject  matter of  the present  appeals.  The respondents are  at liberty  to withdraw  the  same  without furnishing any security. The withdrawal of 50% of the amount will be  subject to  the result  in the  appeal. In case the appeals are  allowed, to  that extent  the respondents shall restitute the amounts withdrawn.

" J U D G M E N T P.K. BALASUBRAMANYAN, J. 1.              While, I agree with the conclusion of my learned Brother on the interplay of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as ’SICA’) and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 on the question of law formulated while issuing notice on the Petition for Special Leave to Appeal to this Court, and his final order, I think it necessary to express my reservation on the propriety of the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court on the facts and in the circumstances of the case.  While purporting to exercise jurisdiction in a writ petition challenging an order of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (hereinafter referred to as, ’B.I.F.R.’) which was approached by the respondent, the Division Bench of the High Court has chosen to brush aside valid orders passed by the Company Court in Allahabad, the order to maintain status quo passed by the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (A.A.I.F.R.) and by various Debts Recovery Tribunals and has permitted the asset of the respondent to be sold as proposed by the respondent.  It must be noted that the orders were made by the competent tribunals or court and that those orders were binding on the respondent, the writ petitioner in the High Court.  If on its understanding of Section 22(3) of SICA, the High Court was of the view that the orders of restraint did not bar the BIFR from considering the prayer of the respondent, there was still the order of A.A.I.F.R. to maintain status quo regarding the assets of the respondent-Company.  Surely, that was an order under the SICA.  No reason is given by the High Court to hold that the order of A.A.I.F.R. is also not binding on B.I.F.R. or that B.I.F.R. could ignore it.  According to me, the High Court should have dealt with the question properly with reference to the nature of the relevant orders and the context in which they were made and if it was still of the view that the power vested in B.I.F.R. under Section 22(3) of SICA enabled it to override all those orders, it should have normally remitted the application made by the respondent to B.I.F.R. so as to enable it to take a decision on the prayer of the respondent in the context of the proceedings pending before B.I.F.R. and all elements relevant for the purpose of such a decision.  The High Court has also not considered how far it will be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appropriate to permit the sale of the assets of a Company which is before B.I.F.R. for a scheme of revival. 2.                Occasions are not infrequent when not so scrupulous debtors approach B.I.F.R. to stall the proceedings and to keep their creditors at bay.  The delay before the B.I.F.R.  is sought to be taken advantage of. The Parliament has apparently taken note of this and has repealed SICA by the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003.  The vacuum, thus created has been filled by an amendment to the Companies Act. But, so far, the provisions of the Amending Act and the Companies Act introduced, have not been brought into force.  It appears to be time to consider whether these enactments should not be notified.",The High Court should have dealt with the question properly with reference to the nature of the relevant orders and the context in which they were made.

If the order is passed under sub-Section(10) of Section 48E, the same is not appealable under Section 48F.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.1691/2004) SANTOSH HEGDE, J. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. This is yet another case of gross indiscretion on the part of the High Court in reducing the sentence imposed by the trial court in a heinous crime. The respondent herein was convicted by the Special and Second Additional Judge, Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, for an offence punishable under section 366 IPC and was sentenced to undergo RI for a period of 4 years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-; in default of payment of fine to undergo further period of 3 months’ RI. The respondent challenged the said conviction and sentence before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur and the High Court by the impugned order while confirming the finding of conviction recorded by the Sessions Court for an offence punishable under section 366 IPC, reduced the sentence of imprisonment to a period already undergone while maintaining the sentence of fine. The reason recorded by the High Court for reducing the sentence is that the respondent has already suffered the sentence of imprisonment for a period of 1 month and 3 days, and that he at the time of commission of offence was an uneducated labourer from rural area and was aged 21 years. While doing so, the High Court did not take into consideration that under the Act the offence is punishable up to 10 years’ RI and the Sessions Court while considering the quantum of punishment had noted that the at the time of kidnapping, the victim was approximately 16 years of age and that she was seduced and kidnapped by the respondent by promising her to marry and in those circumstances after recording reasons that the offence in question was a serious one in that the appellant had sexually exploited a young girl of 16 years and thereafter deserted her, hence awarded the sentence of 4 years’ RI which itself in our opinion was inadequate. Even then the High Court without considering the gravamen of the offence and the ignominy to which the victim has been put to with misplaced generosity/sympathy which has an everlasting adverse effect on her future, has unreasonably reduced the sentence to a period already undergone which is one month and 3 days. In our opinion this is a ridiculously low http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 sentence, totally disproportionate to the crime committed by the respondent. We notice that the conviction recorded by the Sessions Court is not challenged by the appellant before the High Court nor is it challenged before this Court. Therefore, the question of our going into the validity of the conviction does not arise. For the reasons stated above, we allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court reducing the sentence, and restore the sentence awarded by the Sessions Court. We direct the respondent to surrender and serve out the sentence awarded by the Sessions Court.","The respondent herein was convicted by the Special and Second Additional Judge, Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, for an offence punishable under section 366 IPC.

" JUDGMENT 2001 (1) SCR 1113 The following Order of the Court was delivered : It is quite evident that Section 206-C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 refers to a case where by reason of the payment to the seller the producer gets specific goods mentioned in the Table to the said Section of gets a right to collect or receive those goods by virtue of that payment. In the instant case, when the Government issues a licence, it only enables the licensee to carry trade or business in that item. The payment made by the licensee by way of licence fee does not ipso facto entitle the licensee to left the goods. For obtaining the goods mentioned in the Table, the licensee has to place an order on the manufacturer or the supplier of the said goods and it is at that point of time that Section 206-C would get attracted. The reliance placed on the explanation to sub-section (11) of Section 206-C is misplaced as is evident from what is stated herein above. ""Buyer"" would mean where a person by virtue of the payment gets a right to receive specific goods and not where he is merely allowed/permitted to carry on business in that trade. It is for this reason that we had earlier dismissed the special leave petitions and any observations of the High Court not in consonance with this may be not strictly correct but the fact remains that on licences issued by the Government permitting the licensee to carry on liquor trade the provisions of Section 206-C are not attracted as the licensee does not fall within the concept of ’buyer’ referred to in that Section. Buyer has to be buyer of goods and not merely a person who acquires a licence to carry on the business. Hence the Special leave Petition is dismissed.","Section 206-C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 refers to a case where by reason of the payment to the seller the producer gets specific goods mentioned in the Table.

" JUDGMENT ORDER ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. During hearing of this appeal it was fairly conceded by learned counsel for the parties that the decision of this Court in Collector of Central Excise, Patna v. Usha Martin Industries, [1997] 7 SCC 47) on which CEGAT placed reliance was over-ruled by a subsequent decision of a Constitution Bench in Collector of Central Excise, Vadodra v. Dhiren Chemical Industries, [2002] 2 SCC 127. But learned counsel for the respondent submitted that paragraph 11 of Dhiren Chemical’s case (supra) operates in its favour. It reads as follows: ""We need to make it clear that, regardless of the interpretation that we have placed on the said phrase, if there are circulars which have been issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs which place a different interpretation upon the said phrase, that interpretation will be binding upon the Revenue."" Subsequently, the effect of this observation was noted in several decisions. In Kalyani Packaging Industry v. Union of India and Anr., [2004] 6 SCC 719 it was noted as follows : ""We have noticed that para 9 (para 11 in SCC) of Dhiren Chemical case [2004] 6 SCC 722 is being misunderstood. It, therefore, becomes necessary to clarify para 9 (para 11 in SCC) of Dhiren Chemical case [2004] 6 SCC 722. One of us (Variava, J.) was a party to the judgment of Dhiren Chemical case and knows what was the intention in incorporating para 9 (para 11 in SCC). It must be remembered that law law laid down by this Court is law of the land.  The law so laid down is binding on all courts/tribunals and bodies.  It is clear that circulars of the Board cannot prevail over the law laid down by this Court.  However, it was pointed out that during hearing of Dhiren Chemical case because of the circulars of the Board in many cases the Department had granted benefits of exemption notifications. It was submitted that on the interpretation now given by this Court in Dhiren Chemical case the Revenue was likely to reopen cases. Thus para 9 (para 11 in SCC) was incorporated to ensure that in cases where benefits of exemption notification had already been granted, the Revenue would remain bound. The purpose was to see that such cases were not reopened.  However, this did not mean that even in cases where the Revenue/Department had already contended that the benefit of an exemption notification was not available, and the matter was sub judice before a court or a tribunal, the court or tribunal would also give effect to circulars of the Board in preference to a decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court.  Where as a result of dispute the matter is sub judice, a court/tribunal is, after Dhiren Chemical case, bound to interpret as set out in that judgment.  To hold otherwise and to interpret in the manner suggested would mean that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 courts/tribunals have to ignore a judgment of this Court and follow circulars of the Board.  That was not what was meant by para 9 of Dhiren Chemical case."" A disparate view has been taken in CCE v. Maruti Foam Pvt. Ltd., [2004] 6 SCC 722 para 7 and Commissioner of Customs, Calcutta and Ors. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. and Anr., [2004] 3 SCC 488 para 34. It appears to us that the law declared by this Court is binding on the Revenue/Department and once the position in law is declared by this Court, the contrary view expressed in the circular should per force lose its validity and becomes non est. Though the view expressed in Kalyani’s case (supra), and our view about invalidation might clarify the observations in para 11 of Dhiren Chemical’s case (supra), we feel that the earlier judgment in Dhiren Chemical’s case (supra), being by a Bench of five Judges, it would be appropriate for a bench of similar strength to clarify the position. In the circumstances, we refer the matter to a larger bench of five Hon’ble Judges. Let the papers be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate Bench.","Para 9 (para 11 in SCC) of Dhiren Chemical case [2004] 6 SCC 722 is being misunderstood.

These appeals are being disposed of by this common order as the question of law involved in the appeals is common. 2.      At the relevant time when the accident occurred, the driver of the vehicle was holding the driving licence of light motor vehicle added with goods vehicle whereas the vehicle which met with an accident was passengers vehicle. 3.      It is submitted by Mr. Joy Basu, learned counsel for the appellants that the Insurance Company is not challenging the award in regard to the payment of compensation to the third parties.  However, as the driver was not holding a valid driving licence to drive the passengers vehicle at the relevant time, the Insurance Company has a right to recover the payment of the award amount given to the third parties from the owner of the vehicle. 4.      The Insurance Company had entered appearance before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal and filed its written statement.  In the written statement, the defence taken by the respondent-Insurance Company to the claim petition is as under: ""That the driver of the vehicle did not have a valid driving licence and the liability, if any, is, therefore, of the owner of the vehicle or its driver.  The replying respondent, however, reserves its right to ascertain the factual position in case the particulars about the driving licence are supplied by the co-respondent to prove its defence."" No amendment was made in the written statement at a later stage nor did the Insurance Company lead any evidence except that the Licensing Authority was called to prove the driving licence of the driver at the relevant time.  As a matter of fact, it has been proved that the driver was not holding a licence to drive the passengers vehicle at the time of the accident.  The Insurance Company had not led any evidence to prove that the accident was caused due to the negligence of the driver and the cause of the accident was disqualification of the driver to drive a passengers vehicle as he was holding a different type of driving licence whereas he was driving a different category vehicle. 5.      In our view, the case is fully covered by a decision of this Court in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran Singh rendered by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court reported in (2004) 3 SCC 297, wherein this Court in paragraph No.110(iii) at page 341 has held as under:- ""(iii)  The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub- section (2)(a)(ii) of Section 149, has to be proved to have been committed by the insured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for diving at the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the insured or the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 third parties.  To avoid its liability towards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly licensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time."" 6.      In the absence of any evidence to prove that the owner had not taken any care before the vehicle was given to the driver to drive it and that he was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of the vehicle by a duly licensed driver, the liability of the Insurance Company to pay the compensation qua the owner of the vehicle cannot be  doubted. 7.      For the aforesaid reasons, the appeals are dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.","Insurance Company is not challenging the award in regard to the payment of compensation to the third parties.

" THE 4TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.B. Pattanaik Altaf  Ahmed,   Additional  Solicitor   General,   N.N. Goswami, Sr.  Adv., Ashok K. Srivastva, Anil Katiyar and Ms. Mridul Aggarwal,  Advs. With  them for  the appellants   In- person for the Respondent O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the appellants and Major R.N. Mathur, respondent-in-person. This appeal  arises from  the judgment and order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Jaipur, made on 6.3.1996 in O.A. No.648/94. Admittedly, the  respondent was  granted,  in  1980,  a permanent NCC  Commission. The  letter of  appointment dated 23.5.1980 indicates  that,  as  a  condition,  the  selected officers  granted   permanent  NCC   Commission  under   the Government of  India’s  letter  dated  August  4,  1978,  as amended, might  be appointed  in  NCC  units  and  on  staff including  Directorate  General,  NCC.  Clause  (5)  of  the appointment letter  says that  these officers,  if otherwise not found  unfit, would  be eligible to serve till 55 years. This controversy is no longer res integra. This question was considered by  this Court  in Union  of India  & Anr. vs Lt. Col. Komal  Chand &  Ors. [AIR  1992 SC 1479] wherein it was held that  it was  considered desirable that before a person was granted  NCC permanent  Commission in terms of the above letter, an  opportunity should  be given  to him to consider the terms  and conditions of the appointment and then he may indicate his  choice by  exercising his  option in  the form prescribed in  appendix ‘B’  to the letter. We cannot accept the  contention  of  the  respondent.  Having  accepted  the Commission in  1980, it  is not  open to  him to contend now that during  these years  he  did  not  read  the  terms  of appointment. This  Court has  clearly laid  down that para 8 makes a  limited application  of the Civil Services Rules in regard to  pension only  and cannot be held to have rendered http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the provisions  of para  5 fixing in clear and express terms ""the age  of superannuation  as fifty  five years nugatory"". The  contention   of  the   learned  counsel,  Mr.  Mukhoty, appearing in  that case  that since  the rules  framed under Section 13  of the  NCC Act do not fix the age of retirement of the  respondents, they could not be retired at the age of 55 years,  therefore, was not accepted by this Court. It was held that  ""it is  true that  there is no statutory rules at all  dealing   with  the   age  of   superannuation  of  the respondents but  for that  reason the age which is fixed for the civil  servants governed by the Fundamental Rules cannot be brought  in. In the absence of a Rule to the contrary the Central Government  is fully authorised to fix the age which it has  done and  which  was  accepted  voluntarily  by  the respondents. They must now retire when they reach the age of 55 years.""  Thus, it  is clear that the appointment was made fixing the  age of  superannuation of  55  years.  In  terms thereof, the  officer is required to retire at the age of 55 years. It is  in an  admitted position  that  the  Fundamental Rules have  no application  and the  statutory rules equally have no application. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal is clearly  in error  in directing  the appellants to retain the respondent herein, in service till 57 years. The   appeal    is   accordingly    allowed.   In   the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.","This appeal  arises from the judgment and order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Jaipur, made on 6.3.1996.

The short but important question of law which arises for determination in this C ivil Appeal is whether the subject transaction is an interstate sale or not under Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. In our view, the learned Single Judge was right in coming to the conclusion that the matter required interpretation of various documents and adjudication on numerous facts. That, there is a hierarchy of Authorities before whom the assessee could have obtained red ress and since the assessee had failed to prefer an appeal to the First Appellate Authority und er Section 20 of Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, the assessee should be directed to exhaust th e appeal provisions under the said 1957 Act. In this connection, it may be noted that the assessee preferred Writ Petition to the High Court against the Order of Assessment, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 4 without exhausting the provisions concerning appeal under Section 20 of the 1957 Act. However, the Division Bench in the present -2- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 4 case has gone into the merits of the case and has decided the matter against the assessee. W e are of the view that the Division Bench should not have interfered with the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge in directing the assessee to exhaust statutory remedy under the Act, particularly, when disputed facts arose for determination which warranted adjudication by the Authorities under the Act. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned judgment of the Division Bench and restore the Order of the learned Single Judge directing the assessee to move in appeal under Section 20 of the 1957 Act. The assessee - appellant herein will move under Section 20 of the 1957 Act in appeal within a period of four weeks from today. The delay, if any, stands condoned for the simple reason that important question of law does arise and secondly, the assessee herein ha s deposited substantial amount under the 1957 Act. We may further state that the appeal shall be decided on merits without pre-deposit within two months of the date of the assessee filin g its appeal.

" JUDGEMENT Sujata V. Manohar, J. The  appellants  were  initially  appointed  in  the service of the North Eastern Railway as carpenters. However, on  their  passing trade test for carpenter and wireman they were appointed as wiremen-cum-carpenters  with  effect  from 16.12.1968.  As the category of  carpenter-cum-wireman was a non-standard category, the North-Eastern  railway  authority decided  to  abolish  this  category  in 1978. Options were invited from the original appellants who were six in  number to  opt  either  for  the  carpenter’s category or wireman’s category. In 1979 the appellants exercised their option  for the  category  of  wireman.  Thereafter  they were posted as wiremen.  However,  on  account  of  problems  which   arose relating to the seniority of the appellants qua the existing wiremen,  the  General  Manager  of North-Eastern railway by issuing order dated 24.9.1984, decided to put the appellants in the category of carpenter which was the category in which they were initially appointed. Their names were removed from the seniority list of wiremen. The  appellants had, in the meanwhile, in 1984 filed a suit for a declaration that they were eligible  to  appear for  the  test  for  promotion to the highly skilled wiremen Grade II posts.  Since they were abbsorbed as wiremen.   The suit was  decreed.   The appeal which was transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal has  been  allowed  and  the suit has  been  dismissed.  The Tribunal has rightly come to the conclusion that  under  paragraph  2011  of  the  Indian Railway  Establishment  Code Volume II a competent authority may transfer a railway servant  from  one  post  to  another provided   that,   except  on  account  of  inefficiency  on misbehavior or on his written  request,  he  shall  not  be transferred  to a post carrying less pay than the pay of the post over which he holds a lien. In the present  case  the  posts  of  carpenter  and wiremen  are  equivalent posts carrying the same pay and the same terms and conditions of service.  The post of carpenter is also a post  to  which  the  appellants  were  originally appointed.   Now,  on  account of administrative reasons the appellants have been posted as carpenter instead of  wiremen http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 when  the  category of carpenter-cum-wireman was proposed to be abolished.  We are  also  informed that out  of  the  six appellant two have been died and the other  four  have  been working   as   carpenter   after  the  Tribunal’s  order  of 10.2.1987. Looking to all the circumstances of  the  present case  this  is not a fit case for setting aside the decision of the General Manager  of  24.9.1984  when  the  appellants continued  to get the same pay in the same pay-scale and the terms and conditions of service were  not  affected  in  any manner. The  appeal  is,  therefore,  dismissed. There will, however, be no orders as to costs.","The appellants were initially appointed in the service of the North Eastern Railway as carpenters.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3748 OF 2002 Heard learned counsel for the appellant.  Despite of notice, none appears on behalf of the respondent. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29/10/2001 passed in RSA No.4289/1999 reversing the judgment of the appellate Court albeit without framing substantial question of law.  Be that as it may, we are not concerned with that questions now. The facts in brief are that the respondent Smt. Basso, wife of Ajaib Singh, was operated upon on 23/2/1987 for tubectomy operation at Civil Hospital, Sardulgarh, District Mansa.  After the said operation, she became pregnant and gave birth to a female child.  It was alleged that she became pregnant due to defective operation conducted by the doctors of the Health Department.  She claimed a compensation of Rs.3,00,000/-.  However, the trial Court awarded only Rs.50,000/-.  On an appeal preferred  by  the State, the first .......2. - 2 - appellate Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the claim.  The High Court has reversed the finding of the appellate Court and awarded Rs.50,000/-.  The High Court, while awarding compensation of Rs.50,000/- referred to a decision of this Court rendered in State of Haryana Vs. Santra (Smt.), (2000) 5 SCC 182.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh, made on July 26, 1995 in RSA No. 575/95. The admitted  position is  that one  Mukhtiar Singh was the original  owner of the property. He died in 1966 leaving behind him was his son Harsukhjit Singh and his widow Pritam Kaur. Pritam  Kaur died  in 1971.  Harsukhjit Singh  has two sons,  viz,   Parshotam  Singh   and  Lakhmir  Singh  .  The respondents are the widow and sons of Lakhmir  Singh and the appellants are  the heirs of Parshotam Singh. The appellant- plaintiff  had   filed  a  suit  for  joint  possession  and declaration that  they are entitled to half the share in the property succeeded  by Harsukhjit  Singh.  The  trial  Court decreed the  suit. But, on appeal, it was reversed. The High Court dismissed  the appeal  on the  ground of  delay. Thus, this appeal by special leave. On the  facts and circumstances, the High Court was not justified in  dismissing the  appeal on  the ground  of mere delay. The  High Court  would have gone into the question of the right  to the  succession of   the  property. It is seen that the appellate Court had recorded a finding of fact that Harsukhjit Singh  had succeeded  to not only the property of his grandfather  but also a part of the property heed by his mother, Pritam Kaur. Under these circumstances, the property which he inherited from his mother, Pritam Kaur would be his self-acquired property.  But the  property succeeded through his grand-father, Bakhtawar Singh would assume the character of joint  property.  The  appellate  Court  had  recorded  a finding that  since Harsukhjit Singh had blended his private property and  the joint  family  property,  it  assumed  the character of  self-acquired property.  Therefore, it  is not partible between  the appellants  and the  respondents.  The view taken  by the  appellate Court is clearly wrong in law. Though  Harsukhjit   Singh  had  blended  the  joint  family property with   his  private  property  inherited  from  his mother, the  joint family  property still  remains to be the joint family property until it is divided between the  heirs http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of Harsukhjit  Singh. The  appellant being  the heirs of the father of  the respondent Parshotam Singh, they are entitled to the  half share  in the  property succeeded by Harsukhjit Singh from  his grant-father  and the rest of the half share would go  to the respondents. The appeal  is, therefore,  allowed. The  orders of the High Court  and the  District Court  stand  set  aside.  The matter is  remitted to  the trial Court to pass final decree in accordance  with law.  The decree  of the    trial  Court stands restored. But, in the circumstances, without costs.","High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh, made judgment on July 26, 1995 in RSA No. 575/95. Mukhtiar Singh was the original owner of the property.

" ORDER 1.Tej Dan, late husband of the petitioner was working  as patwari  in  the  service of the  State  of  Rajasthan.   He retired from service on June 30, 1980.  After his retirement he  married  the petitioner Laxmi Kunwar on March  8,  1987. Shortly  thereafter he died.  The Rajasthan  Government  has denied  family pension to the petitioner on the ground  that Tej  Dan  married her after retirement from service  and  as such  under  the  rules she is not entitled  to  the  family pension.  This petition under Article 32 is by Laxmi  Kunwar the  widow  of  Tej Dan seeking  a  mandamus  directing  the respondents to grant family pension to her. 2.The State of Rajasthan, in the counter-affidavit  filed before this Court, has taken the following stand: ""The  family of Shri Tej Dan was  entitled  to pension  by  virtue of Rule 268-A to  268D  of Chapter XXVIII-A of (New Family Pension Rules) Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951.  Rules 268-A, B and D are annexed hereto and marked Annexure A is  true  and correct copy  of  the  aforesaid Rules.   It is respectfully submitted that  in view  of  existing  Rules  the  definition  of family  does not take into its sweep  wife  or husband  getting married after the  retirement or  even  children legally adopted  after  the retirement.   In  view of  the  aforesaid  the petitioner  is not entitled to family  pension because she admittedly got married to Tej Dan, patwari  after he retired from the service  of the State of Rajasthan."" Rule  268-D  which defines the  family  is  as under: ""(1)  ’Family’,  for  the  purposes  of   this chapter, will include the following  relations of the officer: (a)   Wife, in the case of male officer; http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (b)   husband,   in  the  case  of  a   female officer; (c)   minor sons; and (d)   unmarried minor daughters. 304 Note (1)(c)  and (d) will include children  adopted legally before retirement.

" O R D E R The petitioner  has raised  a jurisdictional issue. The learned single  Member of  the Tribunal  has  dismissed  the petitioner’s application  in O.A.  No.648/92 by  order dated May 11,  1993. Learned  counsel Shri  D.K. Garg  relies upon Section 5  of the  Administrative Tribunals  Act, 1985  (for short, the  ’Act’) to  contend that the single Member had no jurisdiction to  decide the  matter relating to promotion of the petitioner. His case is that he joined the Department as a seri-skilled  Horkman and was later on appointed as Asstt. Store Keeper  against OEP  vacancy in Dehradun. When juniors and also seniors to him were promoted in OEP Section, he was singled  out  violating  his  right  for  consideration  for appointment to  the higher  post in OEP Section. The case of the respondents  is that  he  was  in  Maintenance  Section, though at  the initial  stage when OEP Section was a cell he had worked  therein. Therefore,  he was  not eligible  to be considered. All others were transferred along with the posts to the  Ordnance factory  while he  remained in  Maintenance Section.  As   a  consequence,  they  formed  a  class,  the petitioner being a class apart. The question,  therefore, is whether the learned single Member of  the Tribunal  was competent to decide the matter. We are  of the  view that the member had the jurisdiction to decide the  matter for  the reason  that it is not a case of initial lack of jurisdiction. Undoubtedly, the Vice-Chairman of the Tribunal by operation of sub-Section (1) of Section 5 has been  empowered to  classify classes  of cases  and make sitting arrangements  of benches  for convenient disposal of cases; and  he  had  ordered  accordingly.  Sub-Section  (2) enumerates various  categories of  cases which  the  members would be  competent to  dispose of.  When its  member  would dispose  of   which  matter   is   one   of   administrative convenience; it  does not  relate to  his jurisdiction. Even http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 under Section  21 of  the Civil  Procedure  Code  objections relating to  pecuniary or  territorial jurisdictional should be raised  at the  earliest and if the parties omit to plead and raise  the objection,  at a  later  stage,  unsuccessful party would  be precluded  to raise  lack  of  jurisdiction. Since the  Tribunal consists  of several  members,  a  bench consisting of  a single  member may  also  be  competent  to dispose of  certain matters.  The matter having been decided by him after considering the case on merits, it is no longer open to  the unsuccessful party to plead that the member had no jurisdiction  to decide  the  issue  or  that  the  order suffers from  initial lack of jurisdiction. It may be a case of improper  disposal of  the matter  without  touching  the jurisdiction of the member who decided the matter. Under these circumstances, we do not think there is any lack of  jurisdiction warranting  interference. The petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner raised a jurisdictional issue.

" J U D G M E N T ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by my learned and respected Brother that the opinion of Chemical Examiner, Kandaghat Laboratory was not to be excluded.  However, I am unable to agree with the views as regards Section 50 of the NDPS Act. Baldev Singh’s case (supra) made the position clear that the said provision has application in case of search of a person. The crucial question would be whether search of a bag carried on the shoulder or back of a person is covered by Section 50.  I am of the view that it would not be so.  There can be no basis for making a distinction between search of a bag found near a person and a bag carried by him.  In Kanhaiya Lal v. State of M.P. (2000 (10) SCC 380) it was held that when a bag carried by the accused is searched, Section 50 has no application.  In Gurbax Singh v. State of Haryana (2001 (3) SCC 28) it was held that when a bag was being carried on the accused’s shoulder, Section 50 has no application. In Saikou Jabbi v. State of Maharashtra (2003 (9) JT 609) it was held as follows: ""A bare reading of Section 50 shows that it only applies in case of personal search of a person. It does not extend to search of a vehicle or a container or a bag, or premises. (See Kalema Tumba v. State of Maharashtra and Anr. (JT 1999 (8) SC 293), The State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh (JT 1999 (4) SC 595), Gurbax Singh v. State of Haryana (2001(3) SCC 28). The language of Section 50 is implicitly clear that the search has to be in relation to a person as contrasted to search of premises, vehicles or articles. This position was settled beyond doubt by the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh’s case (supra). Above being the position, the contention regarding non- compliance of Section 50 of the Act is also without any substance. In the case at hand the contraband articles were suspected to be hidden in the blue suitcase of the accused, and was not in his physical possession. The suitcase was put on the screening machine.  This cannot be equated to be a recovery made from the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 person of the accused by a personal search. In Birakishore Kar v. State of Orissa (2001 (9) SCC 541) it was held that when there was a recovery from a plastic bag belonging to the accused on which he was found sitting on railway compartment, Section 50 was not applicable.  Baldev’s case (supra) was referred to hold that Section 50 in case of search comes into play only in case of search by a person as distinguished from search from any premises etc.  The position was also highlighted recently in Madan LaL & Anr. v. State of Himachal Pradesh (2003 AIR SCW 3969). Above being the position the High Court was justified in holding that Section 50 had no application."" Therefore, in my view there was no infraction of the requirements of Section 50 of NDPS. The High Court went wrong in holding otherwise.

We make it clear that the learned counsel appearing for the appellant did not press the appeal which has also been filed against the order dated 31st of July, 2006 in CRP No. 362 of 2004 and therefore, this appeal stands dismissed in so far as regards the order dated 31st of July, 2006 in CRP No. 362 of 2004.

Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the impugned order as well as the order of the trial Court rejecting the application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC, we are of the view that the order impugned in this appeal was passed by the High Court without applying its mind and without passing a reasoned and speaking order. The High Court, in the impugned order, had only referred that the points raised in the petition under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC shall be decided at the time of disposing of the original suit. That being the position, the impugned order cannot stand and accordingly, the order dated 31st of July, 2006 in CRP No. 288 of 2005 is set aside and the CRP No. 288 of 2005 is restored to its original file. The High Court is requested to decide the Civil Revision case being CRP No. 288 of 2005 at an early date preferably within three months from the date of communication of this order.

" AND SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 14275 OF 1996 O R D E R The petitioner,  Pirthi @  Sansi admittedly had entered into an  agreement or May 6, 1988 to sell 16 kanal 16 marlas of agricultural  land for a consideration of Rs.50,000/- per killa and  received a  sum of  Rs.24,000/- as earnest money. The respondent  filed a  suit for  specific  performance  in April 1993  against the  petitioner. It  was  his  plea  and accepted by  all courts that he was always ready and willing to perform  his part  of the  contract and  was willing  and ready to  pay the  balance consideration  or  Rs.  81,000/-. Accepting the  case  of  the  respondent,  the  trial  Court decreed the  suit. On  appeal, the Additional District Judge by his  judgment dated November 15, 1994 reversed the decree holding that  Ramesh and  others had come into possession of the land.  They were  in possession  of  the  land  and  the agreement came to be executed in their favour on December 5, 1994 after  the judgment  of the appellate Court. Therefore, the decree  for specific  performance  was  not  proper  and instead the  alternative relief of recovery and compensation was held  appropriate remedy.  In second  appeal,  the  High Court reversed the decree by the impugned judgment dated May 15, 1996  in R.S.A.  NO.425/95 and  restored the judgment of the trial Court. Shri Mahabir Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner, contended  that   consideration  of  granting  for  specific performance is  a discretion  of the  court and  the  courts granting the decree for specific performance should exercise the discretion  on sound principles of law. The Court should grant alternative  relief instead  of  granting  decree  for specific  performance.   In  view  of  the  facts  that  the petitioner had  already inducted  third party  in possession and they  remained in  possession and also taking possession involves  further  litigation,  the  first  appellate  court rightly refused  to grant  specific  performance.  The  High http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court committed  an error  of law in reversing the decree of the  first   appellate  Court.  We  rind  no  force  in  the contention. It  is an  admitted fact  that Ramesh and Shashi Kapoor, respondent  Nos.2 and  3 had  come  into  possession after the  suit was  instituted and  agreement to  sell  was entered into.  Therefore, the High Court rightly allowed the appeal holding  them to  be not  a bona  fide purchasers and directed decree  for specific  performance in  pursuance  of agreement to  sell dated  6.5.1988. If the contention of the respondents is given acceptance, no contract can be enforced and the party will seek to avoid contract by inducting third party into possession. Therefore the view taken by the first appellate Court  in that  behalf is  clearly illegal. Having regard to  the fact that respondent Nos.2 and 3 are not bona fide purchaser and admittedly came into possession after the suit was  instituted and  the agreement was entered into the High  Court  has  rightly  rejected  their  contention.  The contention since  have come  into possession  the  suit  for specific performance  will be  an impediment in that behalf, bears no force The special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.","Pirthi @ Sansi admittedly had entered into an agreement or May 6, 1988 to sell 16 kanal 16 marlas of agricultural land for a consideration of Rs.50,000 per killa.

Appeal No. 3500/78 and murder reference No. 33/78. S. K. Bisaria for the Appellant. H. R. Bhardwaj and R. K. Bhatt for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 CHANDRACHUD, C.  J. The  appellant’s land was auctioned on December  26, 1976  in a  revenue sale  held  to  recover arrears of  land revenue.  On the  same day, the land of one Mool Chand  was also sold for a similar reason. The deceased Bhagwan Singh, who was 269 an Amin,  acted as  an officer of the Court in effecting the aforesaid sales.  After  the  sale  proceedings  were  over, Bhagwan Singh was returning home on a bicycle, with his peon Shripat, who is examined in the case as P.W.4 The appellant, Mool Chand and the latter’s son Daya Ram lay in wait for the deceased and while he was passing along on his bicycle, Daya Ram fired  three shots  at him; two out of these hit Bhagwan Singh, as  a result  of which  he fell  down. A split second thereafter, the  appellant emerged  with a sword and chopped off the  neck of Bhagwan Singh. Daya Ram is still absconding but the  appellant was convicted by the Sessions Court under section 302  read with  section 34 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to  death. He was also convicted under section 307 of the  Penal  Code.  The  sentence  of  death  having  been confirmed by  the High  Court, the  appellant has filed this appeal by  special  leave.  The  leave  is  limited  to  the question of sentence. We see  no reason  for commuting  the sentence of death imposed  upon  the  appellant  to  the  lesser  sentence  of imprisonment for  life. The fact that Daya Ram is absconding does not  reduce the gravity of the offence committed by the appellant. Bhagwan  Singh had  but performed his ministerial duty as  an Amin in putting the appellant’s land to sale. He bore no  personal grudge  against the  appellant nor  had he anything to  gain for  himself by  selling the  lands of the appellant and  of Daya  Ram. Such  crimes committed  against public servants  for reasons  arising out of the performance by them  of their  public duties must be discouraged and put down with  a firm  hand. We, therefore, confirm the sentence of death passed on the appellant and dismiss the appeal. P.B.R.

From  the judgment and order dated 28th September,  1972  of the, Gujarat High Court at Ahmedabad in Criminal Appeal  No. 966 of 1971. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER, J.-A petition from jail this  is  one-demands closer  judicial care and we have with deep concern  scanned the  materials placed before us in the light of the  grounds of  grievances urged in this appeal.  We find no  reason  to disagree  with  the, findings of guilt  and  refuse  special leave.   Even  so, we are disturbed, having a  look  at  the proceedings  in this case, that the sessions judges  do  not view  with sufficient seriousness the need to appoint  State counsel  for undefended accused in grave  cases.   Indigence should  never  be a ground for denying fair trial  or  equal justice.   Therefore particular attention should be paid  to appoint  competent advocates, equal to handling the  complex http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 cases-not patronising gestures to raw entrants ’to the  Bar. Sufficient  time  and complete, papers should also  be  made available,  so that the advocate chosen may serve the  cause of justice with all the help at his command.  In the present case,  the  accused  has made a grievance  that  the  amicus curioe  came  into picture only on the day  the  trial  com- menced.   This is an unfortunate feature.  Nevertheless,  we are satisfied 73 that   by  postponing  the  examination  of  the   important witnesses  to the next day the learned Judge helped  counsel to  equip  himself  fully.  We are  also  satisfied  from  a perusal  of  the papers that the cross-examination  has  not suffered  for want of time or facility for counsel for  the, accused.   We should, however, emphasize that in  all  these cases there should be a sensitive approach made by the court to  see  that the accused felt confident  that  his  counsel chosen  by the court has had adequate time and  material  to defend him properly.  With these observations, we  dismissed the petition. P.B.R.                            Petition dismissed. 74","Petition for special leave to appeal (Crl.) No. 674 of 1973.

" JUDGMENT ARUN KUMAR, J. This is an appeal against a judgment of conviction under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code passed by the VIth Additional Judicial Commisisioner, Ranchi and confirmed by the High Court of the State of Jharkhand at Ranchi.  The three appellants were sentenced to 10 years R.I. each.  The appellant No.1 Taiyab Khan is the husband of the deceased while appellants No.2 and 3 are his parents.  The deceased was named Noorjahan. Marriage of appellant No.1 with Noorjahan took place in April, 1991.  The incident leading to death of Noorjahan is of 9th February, 1994.  Death of Noorjahan is said to have been caused by poisoning.  The main ingredients of Section 304B IPC are: (a)     Death of a woman; (b)     By burns or bodily injury or occurrence otherwise than under normal circumstances; (c)     Within seven years of her marriage; (d)     Soon before her death the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with demand for dowry. Present is a case of death of a woman having taken place within three years of her marriage.  It is a case of an unnatural death, that is, death which occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances.  The first three ingredients are clearly established.  The only other ingredient which needs to be considered is the harassment of the woman by the husband or his relatives in connection with demand for dowry.  The prosecution examined seven witnesses.  PW1 and PW2 were the brothers of the deceased, PW3 was her maternal uncle while PW4 was the mother of the deceased, PW 5 was a villager, PW6 was the Investigating Officer of the case and PW7 was the doctor who examined the deceased in the hospital.  PW 1 to PW 5 have spoken about the dowry demands made by the appellants and the harassment of the deceased on account of such demands by the appellants.  It is clear from the evidence of these witnesses that the deceased was being constantly harassed for demands on account of dowry.  The deceased was being asked to bring further cash and gold/silver ornaments and on account of non- compliance of such demands, she was being denied food.  On the fateful day she had been removed to hospital in an unconscious state.  PW 2, one of the brothers of the deceased was also the informants to the police at whose instance the FIR was recorded.  He works in a garage where he was informed that his sister was lying unconscious in the Mandar Hospital.  He went home and informed other family members and they all went to the hospital to find out about the condition of the deceased. The defence tried to suggest that the deceased took poison on her own and committed suicide.  However, this was disbelieved by both the courts http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 below.  It is a case of unnatural death.  The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the vicera report would have shown as to whether the death occurred on account of consumption of poison.  This report was never received and therefore, it cannot be said to be a case of death by poisoning. In our view, the absence of vicera report does not make any difference to the fate of the case.  The fact remains that it is a case of unnatural death. Section 304B IPC refers to death which occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances.  It cannot be said to be a case of normal death.  No other point was urged.  We find no merit in this appeal.  The same is dismissed. After holding them guilty of the offence under Section 304B, the courts below have sentenced the three accused to imprisonment for ten years each.  Keeping in view the advance age of appellants 2 and 3, who are parents of appellant No.1, we consider it appropriate that their sentences be reduced.  Accordingly in case of appellants 2 and 3 the sentence of ten years awarded by the courts below is reduced to seven years.   The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","This is an appeal against a judgment of conviction under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code passed by the VIth Additional Judicial Commisisioner, Ranchi and confirmed by the High Court of the State of Jharkhand at Ranchi.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R Perused the report of the Registrar (Judicial) dated 26.09.2006.  The special leave petition was filed on 10.06.2004, which was sent by one Nathu @ Parasram, who is in custody.   He had sent a copy of the judgment passed by the High Court.  The record was, however, put up on 04.09.2006. It is in the aforementioned premise that an inquiry was directed to be conducted.  The Registrar (Judicial), in his report, inter alia, stated that the office had sent for the records of the courts below  which caused delay. Our attention in this behalf has been drawn to  Order XXI Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966+, relevant portion whereof is in the following terms : ""8. (1) If the petitioner is in jail and is not represented by an advocate on record he may present his petition for special leave to appeal together with the certified copy of the Judgment and any written argument which  he may desire to advance to the officer-in-charge of the jail, who shall forthwith forward the same to the Registrar of this Court.  Upon receipt of the said petition, the Registrar of the Court shall,  whenever necessary call, from the proper officer of the Court or the Tribunal appealed from, the relevant  documents for determination of the petition for special leave to appeal. (2)     As soon as all necessary documents are available the Registrar shall, assign an Advocate from a panel of amicus curiae and thereafter place the petition and complete documents for hearing before the Court. The fee of the advocate so engaged shall be Rs.250/- upto the admission stage and a lump sum not exceeding Rs.500/- for the hearing of the appeal arising therefrom, as may be fixed by the Bench hearing the appeal, and in an appropriate case, the Bench hearing the case may for the reasons to be recorded in writing, sanction payment of a lump sum not exceeding Rs.750/-."" Rules framed by this Court must be read in consonance with the fundamental rights of the prisoners.  A prisoner when sends a petition or an appeal from jail, the same requires immediate attention of this Court.  The Court while entertaining a special leave petition having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, may suspend his sentence or allow his prayer for bail.  Each petition is accompanied by a copy of the judgment of the High Court, which is supplied free of charge to the prisoners.  It does not, therefore, appear to be reasonable that in each and every case when the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 matter is being placed before the Registry, the records would be sent for and when they are in vernacular language, the same would be translated into English. The Rule no doubt permits the Registrar to call for documents, but the same is required to be done only when the same is found to be necessary and not otherwise.  Records of the case should not, thus, be called for in a mechanical manner. We, therefore, direct that when the special leave petitions are forwarded through the officer-in-charge of the jail along with certified copy of the judgment, the same should  urgently be placed before the Court.  The first listing of the case should not be delayed.  At best an office note be placed that the translated copy of the records has not been sent;  and if the records are directed to be called for, the same are required to be translated. It is only in cases where records are required to be called for, the same should be done; as otherwise it may await the order of the Court.

" J  U  D  G  M  E  N  T (Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.1540/2005) Delay condoned. Special Leave granted. This is an unfortunate case in which the appellant has been sentenced to undergo life imprisonment for committing the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.  The facts relevant for the disposal of this appeal may be noticed.  It is not disputed that on 22.3.1999  at about 10.30 PM, the accused came home in a drunken state and when his wife (PW-2) served food, he threw away the food and started quarreling with his wife.  In that process, the daughter  (PW-3) of the appellant  and his son (deceased) who were asleep woke up. His son attempted to intervene to save his mother. The appellant is said to have picked up a chopper and inflicted a cut injury on his son on the back of the left leg below the knee.  On an alarm being raised, several villagers assembled but the appellant prevented them from entering his house being in an inebriated state.  It appears that later his son was taken to the hospital.  The medical evidence discloses  that the injury caused his death on account of excessive bleeding. In view of these facts, the question is whether the appellant is guilty of the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that on the basis of the findings of fact recorded by the courts below, an offence punishable under Section 302 IPC is not made out and at best the appellant may be guilty of offence punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC. Counsel for the State submitted that the medical evidence does establish that the death was the result of the injury caused to the deceased. Had the appellant permitted the villagers to intervene and take the injured to the hospital in time, perhaps his life may have been saved because the medical evidence indicates that the deceased died of excessive bleeding on account of damage to a vital artery. The question, therefore, which arises for our consideration is whether the appellant inflicted the injury with the   intention of causing death of the deceased.  Counsel for the State fairly submits that he is not in a position to submit on the facts of this case that the appellant intended  to inflict any injury to cause the death of his son. The next question is whether the infliction of injury was with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the appellant knew would likely cause the death of his son.  Here again, the facts disclose that he did not have such an intention, nor can we find any intention on the part of the appellant of causing bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. We are, therefore, of the view that the offence committed is not an offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.  However, it cannot be denied that the offence would fall under Section 304 IPC because even though the appellant inflicted injury without the intention of causing death, he knew that the injury caused with a weapon like a chopper may cause such injury as is likely to cause death.  We, therefore, find that the offence committed by the appellant is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 one which is punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we partly allow the appeal and set aside the judgment and order of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam dt.21.5.2003 in Crl.A.No.204/2001 to the extent that the conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC is set aside and instead the appellant is found guilty of the offence under Section 304 Part II IPC. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case and the manner in which the appellant behaved,  a deterrent sentence is called for.  We accordingly sentence him to undergo ten years’ rigorous imprisonment under Section 304 Part II IPC. This appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.","The appellant is said to have picked up a chopper and inflicted a cut injury on his son on the back of the left leg below the knee.

" ORDER Leave granted. These appeals are filed against the judgment of  the High  Court  in revision given under the Kerala Land Reforms Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The High Court set aside the judgment of the  Appellate  Authority  dated  20th Dec.  1989  which  affirmed  the  order of the Land tribunal dated 24th Nov.,  1980.  The  dispute  between  the  parties before  the  international  was  as to whether the appellant before us was the cultivating tenant. A limited notice was issued in these appeals  as  to whether  the  High  Court  had acted within its jurisdiction under Section 103 of the Act.  That Section reads as under: ""103, Revision by  High  Court  :-  (1)  Any person aggrieved by - (i)  any  final  order  passed  in an appeal against the order of the Land Tribunal; or this Act; or (ii) any final  order  passed  by  the  Land Board Under this Act; or (iii)  any  final  order  of  the Talok Land Board under this Act, Learned senior counsel for the  appellant  contended that  the  Taluk Land Board and the Appellant Authority have not failed to decide any question of law  nor  could  it  be said that  any  such  question was erroneously decided.  The High Court had interfered with the order of the tribunals on the  ground  that  several  material   documents   including judicial  proceedings were not adverted to by the tribunals. The High Court held that the legal effect of these documents was not considered by the tribunals.  On those  grounds,  it was  argued  the  High  Court  was not entitled to interfere under Section 103 of the Act.  Learned  senior  counsel  for the  appellant  submitted that if certain documents were not considered  or  their  legal  effect  was  not  taken   into consideration,  still  that  did  not amount to an erroneous decision of a question of  law,  not  failure  to  decide  a question of  law.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the question of existence of  tenancy  was  a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 question  of  fact  and  if  certain  documents  which  were relevant  in   that   connection   were   not   taken   into consideration  it could not be said that the question of law was erroneously decided or was not decided. We find sufficient force in the  contention  of  the learned  senior  counsel  for the appellant in regard to the meaning of the words  ""has  either  decided  erroneously  or failed to  decide any question of law"".  On the facts of the present  case  learned  senior  counsel  is   justified   in submitting  that the lower tribunals had neither decided any question  of  law  erroneously  nor  failed  to  decide  any question of   law.      Mere  non-cnsideration  of  relevant documents  including  the  relevance  of  certain   Judicial Proceedings  would  not  strictly fall within Section 103 of the Act. But that, in our opinion, is  not  the  end  of  the matter.   The  High court had still powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to quash the orders  passed  by the tribunals if the findings of fact had been arrived at by non-consideration of the relevant and material documents the consideration  of  which  could  have  led  to  an  opposite conclusion.   This  power  of  the  High  court  under   the Constitution of India is always in addition to the powers of revision under  Section 103 of the Act.  In that view of the matter the High Court rightly set aside the  orders  of  the tribunals.   We  do  not, therefore, interfere under Article 136 of the constitution of India.  The appeals fail and  are dismissed. No costs. may  within such time as may be prescribed, prefer a petition to the High Court against the order on  the  ground that the appellate authority or the Land Board, or the Taluk Land  Board,  as  the  erroneously, or failed to decide, any question of law.""

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(4) SCR 289 The following Order of the Court was delivered: These appeals raise a common question : whether the appellants are entitled to the benefit of Notification No. 53/64, dated March 1, 1964, which, as quoted in the paperbook, reads as under: ""Notification G.S.R. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, the Central Government hereby exempts steel ingots falling under Item No. 26 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944), produced from fresh unused steel melting scrap, exclusively or in admixture with any other material scrap, exclusively or in admixture .with any other material, from so much of the duty of excise as is proved to have been paid on such fresh unused steel melting scrap under Item No. 26 of the schedule provided that no set off of duty has already been availed of. in respect of such scrap."" A plain reading of the notification shows that the Central Government granted qualified exemption on steel ingots falling under Item No. 26 of the first Schedule to the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944). This exemption is subject to the conditions that: (1) the Steel ingots are produced from fresh unused steel melting scrap, exclusively or in admixture with any other material scrap, (2) the fresh unused steel melting scrap: (a) should have suffered duty under the said Item 26 of the first Schedule and (b) no set off of duty has already been availed of in respect of such scrap; and (3) the quantum of exemption is limited to so much of the duty of excise as is proved to have been paid on such fresh unused steel melting scrap under Item 26 of the first Schedule. The appellants made a large claim. But the claim is confined before us only to exemption of steel ingots on the ground that what was used in manufacture of steel ingots falling under Item No. 26 of the First Schedule, was steel melting scrap. The claim of the appellants was negatived by the departmental authorities as well as the Central Government, on revision. On the writ petitions being filed by the appellants before the High Court, a learned Single Judge, held, inter alia. ""It is difficult to accept the contention that cut pieces of blooms used for the manufacture of ingots would also merit exemption. Such cut pieces of blooms do not conform to the description and are entirely different in nature than the ingredient contemplated under the notification."" In our view, the conclusion reached by the High Court cannot be sustained http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for two reasons. First, the revisional authority, namely, the Central Government, in its order dated September 7, 1979 found, ""Therefore, what the petitioners received back was not the same material in its pristine form, which the petitioner had despatched, but only a mutilated or truncated form of the duty-paid bloom, rendered into steel melting scraps."" The High Court has not taken note of this finding. Secondly, in view of the judgment of this Court in the appellant’s own case, titled Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd v. Collector of Central Excise, (1995) 75 E.L.T. 3, melting scrap even of bloom satisfies the requirement of the notification. In the above-cited case, having considered the definition of ’melting scrap’, it was held that the scrap of billet or bloom would not be the same thing as semi-finished product falling under Item 26AA. It would, therefore, follow that the cut pieces of bloom which were rendered into melting scrap, had gone into making of steel ingots falling under Item No. 26 of the First Schedule, so the requirement of the said notification to that extent is fulfilled. The appellants are, therefore, entitled to the benefit of exemption under the notification in regard to so much of the excise duty as is proved to have been paid on such melting scrap under Item 26 of the first Schedule. Accordingly, the orders under challenge are set aside and the civil appeals are allowed. There will be no order as to costs.","The appeals raise a common question : whether the appellants are entitled to the benefit of Notification No. 53/64, dated March 1, 1964. A plain reading of the notification shows that the Central Government granted qualified exemption on steel ingots falling under Item No. 26 of the first Schedule.",appointment,22.13
" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL No.1328 OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(C)5783 of 2006] Delay condoned. Leave granted. The appellant claims to be interested in the property which was the subject matter o f the proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Ernakulam.                Aggrieved by an order passed by the Recovery Officer, the appellant filed an appeal, being No.2/2005, before the said tribunal, which according to the appellant is the second appeal preferred on accoun t of the fact that the earlier appeal had not been registered.  The said appeal was filed with out payment of the requisite court fees, and after considering the submissions regarding the question as to whether such court fees were payable, the tribunal held that the said court f ees were payable and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal. The appellant, thereafter, filed a writ petition before the Kerala High Court questi oning the order passed by the tribunal.  The High Court without going into the question raised, directed sale of the property at the earliest with observations that if the appellant had an y share in the property, he would be entitled to the same from the sale proceeds after such sa le. The said order has been challenged in this appeal, and it appears that by our order dated 3/3/2006, we had recorded that the appellant was ready and willing to pay the court fees as demanded by the Debts Recovery Tribnunal, and that the same would be deposited within two weeks from the date of the order.  Subsequently, on 24/03/2006 when the matter was taken up, it was submitted that the entire court fees, as demanded had been deposited by the appellant by cheque dated 20/03/2006, which fact is admitted by the bank. In such circumstances, we are inclined to allow the appeal and besides setting aside the order passed by the High Court, we are also inclined to restore the appeal before the Debts Recovery Tribunal. Having regard to the above, we allow the appeal and set aside the order passed by th e High Court and further direct that   Appeal No.2/2005 and any other connected appeal be restored for determination on merits. There will be no orders as to costs.","The appellant claims to be interested in the property which was the subject matter o f the proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Ernakulam.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1101 OF 2002 This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court dismissing the claim of the appellant being barred by limitation. Briefly stated the facts are as follows. A contract was entered into between the appellant and the respondent sometimes in the year 1981.  Work order was issued to the appellant on 27/3/1981.  The period for completion of the work was, however, extended upto 30/6/1985.  On 10/12/1985, the appellant made a claim for payment of certain amount.  The respondents did not reply to the claim.  Ultimately, on 10/4/1991, the appellant filed an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940.  The High Court in these circumstances held that under Article 137 of the Limitation Act 1963, the period of limitation provided is for three years from the time when the right to apply accrues and, therefore, the application was barred by time. .......2. - 2 - In the present case, undisputedly, the right to apply accrued on 10/12/1985.  Sectio n 20 application was filed on 10/4/1991.  In our view, therefore, it is clearly barred by the limitation under Article 137 of the Limitation Act which prescribes for three years. This apart, the question raised in the present dispute is squarely covered by the decision of this court rendered in Steel Authority of India Ltd. Vs. J.C. Budharaja, Government and Mining Contractor, (1999) 8 SCC 122, particularly paragraph 27 of the judgment. Learned counsel for the respondent referred to a decision rendered by this Court in Union of India & Ors. Vs. M/s. L.K. Ahuja & Co., AIR 1988 SC 1172.  Learned counsel for the appellant referred to paragraph 8 of the judgment.  The facts of this case is not applicable in the facts of the present case.  In that case, the claim for reference was made within three years commencing from 16/4/1976 and the application was filed under Section 20 on 18/12/1976, i.e. within eight months. In the result, this appeal, being devoid of merit, is, accordingly, dismissed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R Appellants in these appeals have challenged the composite order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in AHO No. 243 of 2001 arising from the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court  in OJC No. 691 of 2001  and OJC No. 2884 of 2002. In AHO No. 243 of 2001 the Division Bench has set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge in OJC No. 691 of 2001 and restored that of the Revenue Division Commissioner (Central), Cuttack (hereinafter referred to as the ""Commissioner"") passed in Khasmahal Lease Appeal No. 2 of 1994 reviving the same on an application moved by the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 after obtaining a probate from the High Court of Calcutta in PLA No. 257 of 1997 decided on 17.5.2000.  Earlier Khasmahal Lease Appeal No. 2 of 1994 had been dismissed by the Commissioner as Respondent Nos 1 and 2 had failed to obtain a probate of the Will executed by Asit Kumar Ghose. In OJC No. 2884 of 2002 the High Court has partly set aside the order passed by the Collector, Puri dated 11.2.2002 after the remand of the case by the High Court.  The order of the Collector holding that the land in dispute can be kept by the Government sine no one had a right to have the settlement.  The order of the Collector in so far as it rejected the claim of opposite party Nos. 4 to 6 (appellants herein) was upheld and it was observed that they did not have the right to the land. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein have been permitted to move an application before the Collector for permanent settlement of the land in their favour under the Orissa Government Land Settlement Act, 1962 and the said application shall be decided by the Collector after noticing the appellants herein. It has been specifically stated that the appellants herein should be made a party before the Collector in the application to be filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein for seeking permanent settlement of the land in their favour. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The High Court in the impugned order has directed the Revenue Divisional Commissioner to decide the Khasmahal Lease Appeal No. 2 of 1994 in accordance with law keeping in view the observations made in the impugned order.  Similarly, the Collector has been directed to decide the application to be filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein keeping in view the observations made in the impugned order.  We find that the observations made by the High Court in the impugned order touch on the merits of the dispute.  Counsel for the appellants apprehends that the observations made by the High Court would influence the mind of the Commissioner as well as the Collector while deciding the case and the application filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein.  We find substance in this submission. Accordingly, we uphold the order of the Division Bench of the High Court in setting aside the order of the learned Single Judge as well as partly set aside the order of the Collector but set aside the order of the High Court in so far as it directs the Commissioner and the Collector to decide the appeal as well as the application to be filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in the light of the observations made by the Division Bench as these observations touch on the merits of the dispute. We, therefore, direct that the Commissioner and the Collector shall decide the appeal and the application to be filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in accordance with law without being influenced by any of the observations made by the Division Bench or the learned Single Judge in their orders on merits of the dispute.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.258 OF 2008 (@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.)NO.2946 OF 2006) Leave granted. Heard. 2.              An Habeas Corpus petition was filed by the first respondent (mother of a married minor girl) alleging that her daughter had been missing from 4.8.2004 and that her enquiries revealed that the second respondent herein had forced her daughter to ’accompany’ him.  But strangely the girl’s husband Madhusudhan Reddy did not take any action in the matter. The Division Bench of the High Court took cognizance of the matter and issued a series of directions to the police to trace the girl.   The police filed affidavits from tim e to time in regard to the steps taken and reported that the girl could not be traced. 3.              The High Court  disposed of the writ petition by order dated 3.2.2006 with a direction to continue the investigation and produce the girl as and when traced.  In the said order dated 3.2.2006, the Division Bench  made an     observation   about    the functioning   of   police,   that  ""police concerned have not taken steps which should have been taken and even after giving a long room to them, they have not done anything in the matter"".  The High Court also directed  the Director General of Police to initiate an inquir y against the officials who were responsible for investigation of the case.  Aggrieved thereby , the State filed this appeal by special leave. 4.              We are informed that the detenu has herself filed an affidavit before the Hi gh Court on 20.4.2006 (after the impugned order) stating that she has married  the second respondent herein and would like to stay with him. She has also contended that her forced marriage with Madhusudhan Reddy was not valid as she was then a minor.  Be that as it may. The learned counsel for the appellants contended that if a girl intentionally elopes with so me one and goes into hiding, it will be very difficult for the police to trace her and in the circumstances, the High Court was not justified in making the adverse comment and directing an enquiry. . 5.              On examination of the facts, we agree with the contention of the appellants. The Division Bench  was not justified in making  the observation about the functioning of the police officers or in  ordering an enquiry against them. We, therefore, order deletion o f the said observation as also the direction for enquiry contained in the impugned order. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","The High Court disposed of the writ petition by order dated 3.2.2006 with a direction to continue the investigation and produce the girl as and when traced.

" O R D E R Delay condoned . This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court, made on 1.7.1996 in LPA  No. 1213/95  confirming the  order  of  the  learned single judge in CWJC No.2311/95. The admitted  position is that the petitioner No.1 came to be  appointed as Assistant, Petitioner No.2 as Driver and petitioner Nos. 3 to 5 as peons on different dates, viz., on August 1,  1988, November  10, 1989, May 31, 1987  and April 22, 1992.  They were  appointed in the co-operative Training institute, Deoghar  by its  principal. They  are  admittedly daily wage  employees. Their  services came to be terminated by the principal. Calling that termination in question. they filed a  writ petition in the High Court. The main grievance of the  petitioners before  us is  that termination of their services is  in violation  of section  25F of the Industrial Disputes  Act,   1947.  The   question  for   consideration, therefore, is  whether the  petitioners can  be said to have been ‘retrenched’ within the meaning of section 25 F  of the Industrial Disputes  Act? Every Department of the Government cannot be  treated to  be ""industry"".  When the appointments are  regulated  by  the  statutory  rules,  the  concept  of ""industry"" to  that extent stands excluded. Admittedly, they were not appointed to  the post in accordance with the rules but were engaged on the basis of need of the work . They are temporary employees  working on  daily  wages.  Under  these circumstances, their  disengagement from  service cannot  be construed to be a retrenchment under the Industrial Disputes Act. The  concept of  ""retrenchment"" ,  therefore, cannot be stretched to such an extent as to cover these employees. The learned counsel for the petitioners seeks to contend that in the High Court, the petitioners did not contend that it is a case of  retrenchment but  termination of  their services is arbitrary. Since they are only daily-wage employees and have no right to the posts, their disengagement is not arbitrary. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court, made on 1.7.1996 in LPA  No. 1213/95.

By the impugned order dated 28.04.1990 the officiating promotion of Stenographer has been cancelled and she was reverted to the post of Junior Clerk. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant approached the Tribunal. The Tribunal quashing the order of reversion, in our view,  erroneously, and directed the reinstatement of the appellant with back wages. Aggrieved thereby, the State preferred a writ petition before the Division Bench of the High Court which was partly allowed by the High Court, holding that while the respondent (appellant herein) would be reinstated she  would not be entitled to back wages. The High Court further directed the State to hold a departmental inquiry. Aggrieved by the aforesaid observation of the High Court the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave. : 2 : By now, it is a well settled principle of law that a person holding a post on officiating or temporary basis has no right to the said post vide State of U.P. v. Kaushal Kishore (1991) 1 SCC 691. Hence he can be reverted at any time without issuing a show cause notice or holding an enquiry. The Tribunal, therefore, fell in error in upsetting the order of reversion of the appellant to the post of Junior Clerk which post she was holding substantively.  Also, the High Court’s order directing a departmental enquiry was totally misconceived.  There is no need for holding such an enquiry while rejecting a person holding a post on an officiating basis.  An enquiry would only be necessary if he was holding the post on a permanent capacity. We see no merit in this appeal and same is accordingly dismissed.

The fact of having approached the High Court after almost 30 years of retirement itself deserves dismissal on the ground of laches and negligence without going into the merit.

The learned Counsel for the State submitted that PW 1 and PW  2   gave evidence that they belonged to Scheduled Caste and that was not controverted at the time when they were examined.  It is quite possible that the appellant also assumed that PW 1 and 2 to be members of a Scheduled Caste in view of the then certificate but later came to know that the prosecutrix  was  not a  member of a Scheduled Caste.

A dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter to be referred to as the ’Act’) was raised and the matter was referred to Labour Court and the Labour Court after hearing both the parties found that there is a breach of Sections 25-G and 25-H of the Act.  It was held that person junior to the respondent is still working whereas the services of the respondent had been terminated. Therefore, the Labour Court allowed the claim of the respondent and granted reinstatement with continuity of service with 50% back wages from the date of demand notice i.e. from 1.2.2000.  Aggrieved against that order a writ petition was filed before the High Court and  the High Court affirmed the order of the Labour Court. Hence, the present appeal. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the appellant has failed to substantiate that no person junior to the respondent had been retained in the Department. It is a clear finding of the Tribunal that a person like Krishan s/o Dharam Singh who is junior to the respondent is still working with the Management whereas the services of the respondent had been terminated. It is also alleged that  another person named Mahabir who is also junior to the respondent is still working with the Management.  Therefore, the Tribunal has found violation of Sections 25-G & 25-H of the Act. This finding of fact has not been controverted by the management and there is no reason to take a different view from the view taken by the Tribunal which was affirmed by the High Court. Hence, we find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed. The respondent shall be reinstated but looking into the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, he will not be entitled to any back wages. The appellant shall issue order of appointment of the respondent within one month from the date of receipt of this order. There will be no order as to costs.","This appeal is directed against the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court dated 28.04.2005.

" J U D G M E N T (with C.A. No. 9276 of 2003) S. N. VARIAVA, J. The question which arises in these two Appeals is whether the Respondents are entitled to the benefit of Notification No. 217/86-CE dated 2nd April, 1986.   The Tribunal has, in the impugned Orders without giving any ascertainable reasons, held that the lead input sheet would be eligible to the benefit of the Notification, but the headers would not be eligible to the benefit of the Notification. Notification No. 217/86-CE of 1986 only exempts inputs.   It also clarifies that machine, machinery, plant equipment, apparatus, tools or appliances used for manufacturing and processing of any goods or bringing about any change in any substance or in relation to a final product shall be excluded from the term ""inputs"".   What is questioned before us is the finding of the Tribunal that the lead anode sheets are eligible to the benefit of the Notification. It was fairly admitted that sheets would be an input and that if it is clarified that the Notification only applies to sheets and not to the final product manufactured after headers are fixed to the sheets, the Deptt. will be satisfied.  To this there is no objection. In our view it is clear that headers whether attached to lead or aluminium sheets are not inputs.  As they are not inputs the benefit of the Notification would not be available to headers.  However, the sheets are inputs and they would be entitled to the benefit of the Notification. These Appeals stand disposed of accordingly.   There will be no order as to costs.","The question which arises in these two Appeals is whether the Respondents are entitled to the benefit of Notification No. 217/86-CE dated 2nd April, 1986.

However,  there  is one other aspect which  might  bear consideration.  In the course of the order, it was observed: (SCC p. 173, para 17) ""Ordinarily,  keeping in view the judgment  of this  Court in Amulya Chandra Kalita case’  we should have remanded the case to the  Tribunal for a fresh disposal because of the fact  that the order of the Tribunal was rendered by only one member or to have awaited the decision  of some cases pending in this Court in which  the validity of the order passed by single  member of the Tribunal is under consideration....... 3.

By an  order of  this Court dated November 2, 1988, the validity in  CA Nos.  1764 &  2160 of  1988 titled Shivram & Ors. etc.  vs. State of Punjab & Ors., this Court had upheld the  validity   of  the   proceedings  initiated  by  Khanna Improvement Trust  to implement  the scheme framed under the Punjab Town  Improvement Act,  1922. The  High Court in this case refused  to exercise the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution on the ground that the writ petition was highly  belated.   The  High  Court  was  justified  in  its conclusion. The  notification under Section 36 was published on March 3, 1971 and the writ petition was filed sometime in 1988 and  came to  be dismissed  on June  7, 1988.  It is an admitted fact that the appellant had filed an application in 1978 seeking  exemption of  the appellant’s  lands from  the scheme. Thereby,  it would imply that they had the knowledge of the  acquisition proceedings  even as  early as  in 1978. Even then  no  action  was  taken  till  1988.  Under  these circumstances, we  do not  think that  it is  a case  for us warranting interference at this belated stage. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.

It is also stated  that it  was clearly  mentioned in the order of appointment that the appellant could be reverted at any time without any  notice and  that he  would  have  no  right  to seniority in the post. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon  the judgment  of this  Court in Rishal Singh v. State of  Haryana &  Ors. [JT  1994 (2)  SCC  157].  Therein promotion was  given by  the D.I.G.  to the appellant due to his outstanding  merit in  sports relying upon Rule 13.8 (2) of Punjab  Police Rule, 4734. This Court had held that since the D.I.G.  was competent  authority to  make appointment by promotion and  having considered the appellant therein as an outstanding sportsperson  had promoted  him; it  was done in terms of  Rule 13.8  (2) of  the Rules giving power to grant any temporary  promotion; the  promotion, therefore,  though termed to  be a temporary promotion, was in effect a regular promotion. Under  those circumstances,  it was held that his reversion as  Constable was  bad in law. Admittedly, in this case, the  Superintendent of  Police has promoted him and no approval of DIG was obtained. Under those circumstances, the ratio therein  has no  application to  the facts.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. We have learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Punjab  & Haryana High Court, made on November 2,1995 in CWP No.  16409/92. The controversy raised in for the advance increment.  In  which  scale  of  pay  the  respondents  are entitled to  advance increment  is the question? Admittedly, the respondents  were appointed  on substantive posts of JBT Teachers  and   they  were   temporarily  promoted  as  Head Teachers. The scale of pay for the JBT Teachers is Rs. 1200- 2100/-. They  are discharging the duties temporarily as Head Teachers in  the initial  pay of  Rs. 1410/-.  They  claimed advance increment for discharging the duty as Head Teachers. The High  Court has  construed that they are entitled to the advance increment  as Head Teachers. Rule 4(4) of the Punjab Civil Volume I, part I which reads as under : ""4.4 The initial substantive pay of a  Government   employee   who   is appointed substantively  to a  post on a time-scale of pay is regulated as follows: (i) When  appointment  is  the  new post  involves  the  assumption  of duties   or   responsibilities   of greater importance  (as interpreted for the  purpose of rule 4.13) than these attaching  to such  permanent post, he  will draw  as initial pay the stage  of the  time-scale  next above  his   substantive   pay   in respect of the old post;"" A reading  thereof would  clearly indicate that initial substantive pay  of a  Government employee  who is appointed substantively  to   a  post  on  a  time-scale  of  pay,  is regulated, if  he holds  a lien  on a  permanent post, other than a  tenure post  and when  appointment to  the new  post involves the  assumption to  duties or  responsibilities  of greater importance,  then he  will draw  as initial  pay the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 stage of  the time  scale next  above his substantive pay in respect of  the old  post. Thus,  it could be seen that when JBT Teachers was appointed temporarily as a Head Teacher, he is entitled to draw, since he is holding responsibilities of greater importance  as a Head Teacher, one advance increment n his  old post in the time scale next above the substantive pay on  the date  of his  temporarily promotion  as  a  Head Teacher. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the High Court stands modified.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2598-2599 OF 2002 Heard learned counsel for the appellant. Despite of receipt of notice, neither any counsel represents the respondent nor he himself appears before this court.  However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we propose to dispose of these appeals with a short order. The post of Motor Vehicle Inspector (hereinafter ’MVI’, for short) was advertised. The selection list was prepared on 17/11/1992.  The said list was valid for a period of one year.  It lapsed on 17/11/1993.  The respondent filed a writ petition in 1996 after the lapse of selection list.  This fact was pointed out to the learned single Judge hearing the writ petition. Ignoring such contention, a writ of mandamus was issued directing the appellant to appoint the respondent to the post of MVI.  Aggrieved thereby, a writ appeal was preferred by the State but without any result.  Hence, these appeals by special leave. ........2. - 2 - It is unfortunate that the writ petition preferred by the respondent in 1996 was entertained well after the selection list lapsed on 17/11/1993 and even when such contention was brought to the notice of the learned single Judge, a writ of mandamus was issued directing the appellant to appoint the respondent to the post against which selection list had already lapsed. It is equally unfortunate that the Division Bench of the High Court, in appeal, affirmed the said order.  It is contended by the counsel for the appellant that despite such a direction, the respondent has not been appointed as there was no vacancy. For the reasons aforestated, both the orders of the learned single Judge and of the Division Bench are set aside.  These appeals are allowed.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of S.L.P(C ) No.15343 of 2005) ARUN KUMAR, J By order dated 18th November, 2005 this court allowed the above appeal and remanded the matter to the High Court for decision of the Writ Petition filed by the appellant in the High Court on merits.  We hereby give reasons for the aforesaid order. The appellant was appointed as a Clerk in the Central Bank of India on 12th May, 1981.  He was placed under suspension in view of a criminal case registered against him.  Simultaneously a departmental enquiry was held against the appellant.  Enquiry report went against the appellant and a 2show cause notice dated 19th December, 1997 was issued proposing the punishment of discharge from service.  On 9th February, 1998 order was issued confirming the punishment as proposed in the show cause notice. The departmental remedies persued by the appellant against the said action failed.  Ultimately the appellant filed a Writ Petition in the High Court on 24th May, 2003 challenging the said action against him.  The said Writ Petition was dismissed on the ground of availability of alternative remedy vide impugned order dated 2nd September, 2004.  The present appeal is directed against the said order.  We have perused the impugned order of the High Court.  Although on the question of availability of alternative remedy the view of the High Court  cannot be faulted, yet in the circumstances of the present case, specially when such a long time has elapsed since the action of suspension and thereafter discharge from service was taken against the appellant, we feel that the appellant ought not to have been non-suited  on the ground of availability of alternative remedy.  It is settled law that availability of alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to exercise of jurisidiction  under Article 226 of the Constitution by High Courts.  The long lapse of time since the appellant has been out of  job persuades us  not to drive him to another round of litigation under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  Interest of justice in the present case demands  that the Writ Petition filed by the appellant before the High Court be disposed of on merits. Accordingly we direct the High Court to finally dispose of the Writ Petition on merits in accordance with law.  The impugned judgment of the High Court is accordingly set aside. 27363","The appellant was appointed as a Clerk in the Central Bank of India on 12th May, 1981.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. Though notices  were served  on both the respondents as early as  in March  1991, till  date none  has  appeared  in person  or  though  counsel.  Notices  served  on  them  are sufficient.   The   respondents   are   daughters   of   one Doddahanumegowda. Doddahanumegowda  died  on  May  21,  1972 leaving behind  Chikhanumegowda, Ningamma (first defendant), Mariyamma (Plaintiff  No.2), Javaramma (defendant No.2), and Boramma (defendant  No.3) both through their predeceased son Chikhanumegowda. On  his demise Mariyamma and Thimmamma, the daughters  of   Doddahanumegowda  filed   the  suit   for  a declaration that they became owners pursuant to a settlement deed dated  23.5.1970 and  succeeded to the entire property. Therefore, they were entitled to the exclusive possession of the plaintiff’s  property. Thereon, the appellants and thier mother  had   contended  that   they  being   the  heirs  of predeceased son  Chikhanumegowda, they  are also entitled to half   share   in   the   coparcenary   property   left   by Doddahanumegowda. The  Trial Court  dismissed O.S. No.216/72 by its  judgment and  decree dated  June 20,  1977.  But  on appeal, the  appellants court  reversed the  decree  holding that  the   appellants   had   not   proved   as   to   when Chikhanumegowda died  and that  Doddahanumegowda  being  the sole surviving  coparcener, he became the absolute owner and thereby he  was entitled  to bequeath the property in favour of his  daughter, which was upheld by the High Court in S.A. No.34/79 by judgment and decree dated January 24, 1989. It is  seen that  in the  plaint  the  respondents  had admitted that  Chikhanumegowda died  33 years  prior to  the suit.  Suit   was  filed   in  1972.   Thus,  the  death  of Chikhanumegowda, the  father of  the appellants,  admittedly occurred in  1938 or  1939 by  which time  the Hindu Women’s Right to  property Act,  1937 had  come into  force. Section http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 8(d) of  the Act  envisages that where joint family property passes to  a single  coparcener by survivorship, it shall so pass subject  to the  right to  the share  of the classes of females enumerated  in the  sub-sections. Classes of females consist of  widows and  the daughter of the pre-deceased son of  the   sole  surviving   coparcener.  Consequently,   the appellants and  their mother became entitled to the share in the coparcenery  property.  Since  Chikhanumegowda  and  the father of  the respondents  being the  only coparceners they are entitled  to equal share in the property. Therefore, the appellants are entitled to half share in the plaint schedule property.  The  High  Court  and  the  appellate  court  had committed error  in refusing  to grant  relief. The judgment and decree  of the  Trial Court  and the appellate court are set aside.  However, there  shall be a preliminary decree to the extent  of half  share in  the property in favour of the appellants.

The challenge before the High Court in the above writ petitions filed by Koyala Udyog Kamgar Sanghathan was to the action of the Management in effecting recovery of HRA allegedly paid in excess to non-executive employees stationed at Nagpur (A Class).

This contention of the Management for recovering the so-called excess amount was not accepted by the High Court in its impugned judgment.  Hence these Civil Appeals.

Further on reading Annexure C1 dated 23.5.2002, it is clear that CFO had acted on some communications from the Central Office which were capable of two interpretations.  The instructions to CFO were not clear for which no fault lay at the doorsteps of the member-employees of the Sangathan. We are informed that on question of interpretation of the Wage Agreements Nos.

" J U D G M E N T RAJENDRA BABU, J. : The second respondent is a recognized aided school of the Government of Tamil Nadu.  Such schools are governed by Tamil Nadu Recognized Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973 and rules framed thereunder.  All the posts coming within the Private schools are to be filled up in accordance with the provisions contained in the said Act or Rules framed thereto.  The management of school appointed the first appellant as the Head Master.  The second respondent filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority challenging the appellant’s appointment. The Appellate Authority held that the appellant was not holding a post as P.G. Assistant which is the feeder category and, therefore, his appointment as Head Master was bad and set aside the same.  Against that order, appellant preferred a writ petition before the High Court and the learned Single Judge dismissed the same against which writ appeal was also filed.  The concurrent view of Appellate Authority and learned Single Judge or Division Bench of the High Court is that respondent No.2 is the senior most Post Graduate Assistant and he belongs to the feeder category to the post of Head Master; that he had been appointed as a Post Graduate Assistant on regular basis and had been holding the post of Assistant Head Master; that the appellant is not fully qualified Post Graduate Assistant; that he does not belong to the Post Graduate Assistant in academic subject or languages; and that he does not belong to feeder category at all; that he is not entitled to be promoted as Head Master ignoring the claim of the second respondent. In order to find out whether the view taken by the High Court and the Tribunal is erroneous, it is necessary to examine the matter with reference to the relevant rules.  Rule 15(4)(i)(d) provides that the post of Head Master could be filled up only amongst the categories stated therein and they are from the category of (1) Head Masters of High schools; (2) Post Graduate Assistants in academic subjects; (3) Post Graduate Assistants in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 languages provided that they possess the prescribed qualifications.  It cannot be seriously disputed that the appellant is not a Post Graduate Assistant and he does not come under the feeder category.  Merely because he possesses the necessary qualifications by itself will not enable him to claim to be appointed as a Head Master.  It is on this basis the Appellate Authority, the learned Single Judge of the High Court held that the appellant is not entitled to be appointed as the Head Master. The claim made by appellant is that he possesses Master’s degree in History but he had not undergone the regular course but in a condensed course conducted by the Department itself for a period of 10 months and his degree is conferred by way of certificate and such teachers are held to be not in the feeder category so as to become eligible to be appointed as Head Master. Such arrangement of giving certificates to certain teachers became necessary as there was dearth of Post Graduate teachers being available in the Higher Secondary Schools such as that of the second appellant.  Thus he becomes an inducted teacher and not a regular teacher in the cadre. Bearing these aspects in mind and Appellate Authority as well as the High Court, have taken a view, we do not find this matter calls for interference in a proceeding arising under Article 136 of the Constitution. Hence we dismiss this appeal.",Second respondent is a recognized aided school of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The management of school appointed the first appellant as the Head Master.

The Gram Panchayat claimed that it is a pathway and under  the Punjab  Village Common Land [Regulation] Act, 1961 and  later it  stands vested  in the  Gram Panchayat by operation of  Section 4 [2] of that Act.  Admittedly, notice was not  issued to  the Gram  Panchayat. The  authority  had exercised the  revisional jurisdiction  under Section  42 of the Consolidation  Act and condoned the delay and passed the order for  realignment. In  view  of  the  fact    that  the respondent  is   claiming  access   to  his   property   and realignment thereof,  the appropriate course would be to set aside  the   order  and   to  remand   the  matter   to  the consolidation     Officer.  The   Consolidation  Officer  is directed to  issue prior  notice to the appellant as well as to the  respondent. He  should make a personal inspection to the place and then determine the alignment in their presence according to law. That would not only avoid needless wastage of time  but the rights of the parties would also be settled in the  presence of  the parties by looking into the factual position as well as actual need in that behalf.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. A Criminal proceeding has been initiated against the appellant pursuant to the  complaint  filed  by  the  Deputy Collector of  Customs  and  Central Excise, Chandigarh.  The appellant approached the Punjab and Haryana High  Court  for getting the  same quashed.  As his contention that the court at Ambala has no jurisdiction  to  try  that  criminal  case filed against him was not accepted by the High Court and his application  came  to  be dismissed, the appellant has filed this appeal. The  contention of the appellant is that the alleged offence as stated in  the  complaint  took  place  somewhere between  Rohtak and Delhi and therefore the Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Ambala, can have no Jurisdiction to try that offence.  Having gone through the  complaint,  we  find that  the  main  allegation  against the appellant and other accused is that in pursuance of the conspiracy between  them gold  was  transported  from  Pakistan  to  the  place  near Bahadurgarh in Haryana.  It is further stated  therein  that the  goods  had  passed through Amritsar, Rohtak and then to Bahadurharh.  Prima-facie, it appears  that  the  goods  had passed through  Ambala  also.   Therefore, Ambala court will have jurisdiction to try the offence as carrying of smuggled goods is also an offence.  The High  Court  was,  therefore, right  in  dismissing  the Criminal Misalliances Application filed by the appellant. However, it will be open to the  appellant  to  move the  appropriate  forum  for  transfer  of the case from the court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Ambala  is  likely  to cause any undue inconvenience or prejudice to the appellant.

In this civil appeal filed by the Department two questions of law arise for determination which questions are as follow: (1)     Whether interest paid in respect of borrowings on capital assets not put to use in the concerned financial year can be permitted as allowable deduction under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961? (2)     Whether respondent-assessee had an option in law to claim partial depreciation in respect of any block of assets. 4.      Our answer to the above-mentioned       question No.(1) is squarely covered by our decision in favour of the assessee and against the Department in the case of Dy. Commr. of Income Tax, Ahmedabad v. M/s. Core Health Care Ltd. in Civil Appeal Nos.3952-55 of 2002. 5.      Regarding the question No.(2), quoted above, it may be noted that the High Court has relied upon the judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mahendra Mills & Anr. \026 (2000) 243 ITR 56 in which it has been held that the assessee has an option to claim depreciation.  However, Section 34(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short, ""1961 Act"") has been omitted w.e.f. 1.4.88.  Therefore, we are remanding the matter to the High Court after setting aside the impugned order of the High Court on this question, with the direction to the High Court to consider : whether the assessee has an option in law to claim partial depreciation in respect of block of assets.  In the case of Mahendra Mills (supra) the concept of block of assets was not there.  In our view, substantial question of law did arise for determination before the High Court under Section 260A of the 1961 Act, particularly when Section 34(1) of the 1961 Act stood omitted w.e.f. 1.4.88.  The High Court is also requested to consider whether the judgment of this Court in the case of Mahendra Mills (supra) would apply to the assessment years under consideration.  In this connection the High Court is also requested to take into account the scope of Explanation 5 to Section 32(1) of the 1961 Act, made by the Finance Act, 2001. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 6.

Heard the parties at length. Briefly stated the facts are as follows: Undisputedly, the respondent is in the occupation of the public premises owned by the Life Insurance Corporation of India.  The respondent filed application under Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 (hereinafter as ’the Act). Section 7 reads : ""7.Power to require payment of rent or damages in respect of public premises. (1) Where any person is in arrears of rent payable in respect of any public premises, the estate officer may, by order, require that person to pay the same within such time and in such installments as may be specified in the order. ...2/- : 2 : (2)Where any person is, or has at any time been, in unauthorised occupation of any public premises, the estate officer may, having regard to such principles of assessment of damages as may be prescribed, assess the damages on account of the use and occupation of such premises and may, by order, require that person to pay the damages within such time and in such  installments as may be specified in the order. (2A)While making an order under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the estate officer may direct that the arrears rent or, as the case may be, damages shall be payable together with simple interest at such rate as may be  prescribed, not being a rate exceeding the current rate of interest within the meaning of the Interest Act, 1978. (3)No order under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be made against any person until after the issue of a notice in writing to the person calling upon him to show cause within such time as may be specified in the notice, why such order should not be made, and until his objections, if any, and any evidence he may produce in support of the same, have been considered by the estate officer."" On a cursory reading of Section 7 it clearly appears that the power is exercisable by the estate officer suo moto or on an application of the landlord/owner, and the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 occupant of the premises  has absolutely no jurisdiction to file an application under Section 7 of the Act. The only right available to the occupant is that under sub-section (3) the authority must issue notice in writing to the occupant calling upon him to show cause within such time as may be specified in the notice, why such order should not be made. ...3/- : 3 : In our view, the estate officer has rightly rejected the Section 7 application filed by the respondent herein as not maintainable.  The High Court by a strange reasoning allowed the revision petition filed by the respondent herein. We may at this stage quote the reasoning of the High Court with regard to the interpretation of Section 7 of the Act.  This is what the High Court said : ""In my view, section 7 of the Act should be so interpreted enabling a lawful occupier to come before Estate Officer before he is illegally branded as a defaulter and a notice of eviction is served upon him for the intention of the Act is that the dispute referred to in section 7 should not be decided in any other suit or proceeding."" If such an interpretation is accepted it would amount to rewriting the Section which power only belongs to the Legislature not the judiciary. For the reasons aforestated the order passed by the High Court is set aside. This appeal is allowed. The estate officer shall now proceed with PP case being No.EO/180/0199 forthwith and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law expeditiously.",The High Court at Calcutta in C.O.No.2729 of 1998.

This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment and order dated 11.2.205 of the Division Bench of Delhi High Court in LPA No. 1045/2004 of CWP No. 62 of 2004. Heard the appellant in-person and Mr. V.B. Saharya, learned counsel for the DDA. The impugned judgment states as under: "" This appeal is preferred against the order made by learned single Judge in W.P.(C) No. 62/2004 on 28.9.2004.  Learned single Judge has examined the aspect of property tax which has no concern with the services provided by the Delhi Development Authority. About the ground rent the learned single Judge has taken into consideration the facts and the explanation put forth by the respondents and the accounting practice was found to be not unscientific.  In this view of the matter, we would not like to interfere.  Hence the appeal is dismissed"". In our opinion the impugned judgment is a cryptic judgment, and with due respect to the Division bench we feel that the matter in dispute has not been considered by it properly.  In particular, we are of the opinion that the Division Bench should have carefully considered whether the service charge levied by the DDA was valid, considering the fact that service charge is a fee and not a tax and hence there should be a broad co-relation (though not an exact co-relation) between the total service charges levied by the DDA and the value of the services provided to the citizens. The Division Bench also should have considered in detail the appellant’s grievance regarding the ground rent. In that view of the matter, the impugned judgment dated 11.2.2005 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the Division Bench for a fresh decision after hearing the parties, in accordance with law.

" WITH Writ Petition Nos. 939/1996 and 95/97 O R D E R This Court keeping in view the mandate of Articles 47 & 48A of  the Constitution  of India,  issued directions  from time to  time with  a view to tackle the problem arising out of chaotic  traffic conditions  and vehicular  pollution.

The directions  issued by  this Court  are meant  to be complied with  and we  wish to  emphasise  that  it  is  the obligation of  the State  to comply  with the  same. On  our part, we  are considering  the  desirability  of  appointing Court Officers  to assist  the administration with a view to ensure compliance  of the  directions issued  by this Court.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI, J. Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for both the sides. This appeal  is directed against the judgment and order dated 22.8.1996  passed by  the High  Court  of  Punjab  and Haryana in C.W.P.No.6073 of 1996. The  respondent   was  an  employee  of  Haryana  State Electricity Board.  He  was  retired  from  service  on  3rd February,  1994,   about  9   months  before   the  date  of superannuation. He  challenged that  action of the appellant Board by  filing a  writ petition  in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.  It was  the case  of the respondent that he was promoted as  Executive Engineer on 19th February, 1977. when he attained  the age of 50 years his case was considered for retirement/retention  in   service.  It   was   decided   on 30.11.1986 to  continue him  in service.  Again his case was considered when  he attained  the age of 55 years and it was decided on  30.11.1991  to  continue  him  in  service.  His service  record  was  good,  as  on  the  basis  of  overall assessment for  the last  10 years,  the percentage  of good reports was  77%. It  was, therefore,  not  proper  for  the appellant to  retire him  before he  attained the  age of 58 years. He  had challenged  the said  action as arbitrary and illegal. It was  disputed on  behalf of the appellant before the High Court  that service  record of the respondent was good. It was  pointed out  that by an order dated 4th August, 1993 he was  punished  by  stopping  his  two  increments  and  a recovery of  Rs.14,960.50 was ordered. He was again punished by an  order dated  26th October,  1995 and  Rs.7,197/- were ordered to be recovered. The High  Court after perusing the Confidential Reports for the  years 1983-84  and onwards  found that they did not justify respondent’s  compulsory retirement  just  9  months before the date of superannuation. The High Court was of the view that  the two punishments, imposed on him, were not for serious acts of misconduct. It took note of the fact that no act of  misconduct was  alleged against  him  after  he  was granted extension  at the  age of  55 years.  It, therefore, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 allowed the  petition,  set  aside  the  impugned  order  of retirement and  held that  he was  entitled to  continue  in service  with   all  benefits   till  the   actual  date  of superannuation. The contention of Mr. Malhotra, learned counsel for the appellant, is  that the High Court failed to appreciate that the order,  compulsorily retiring the respondent, was passed by the appellant on the basis of his service record. He also submitted that the appellant did not retire him earlier when his case was taken up for consideration on attaining the age of 50 and 55 years because of pendency of his representation and a  departmental inquiry. Soon after the inquiry was over the impugned  order was  passed. The learned counsel for the respondent, on  the other  hand, raised the same contentions which were raised before the High Court. The  record   of  the   case  discloses   that  in  the Confidential Report  for the  year 1985-86 an adverse remark was made  that his  integrity was doubtful. At the time when he attained  the age  of 50 years, his case was taken up for consideration for his retention or retirement but it was not thought proper  to retire  him then  as  his  representation against the  adverse remark  was still not decided. His case was again  taken up  for consideration  when he attained the age of  55 years.  At that  time also  the appellant did not think it fit to We,  therefore,   allow  this  appeal,  set  aside  the judgment and  order passed by the High Court and dismiss the writ petition filed by the respondent.

" J U D G M E N T R.C. Lahoti, CJI Proceedings for eviction of tenant on the ground available under Section 21(1)(f) of the Karnataka Rent Control Act, 1961 (hereinafter, the Act for short) were initiated.  The Trial Court dismissed the claim for eviction.   The landlord preferred revision before the Court of District Judge which was allowed and the tenant and the sub-tenants were directed to be evicted.  The two sub- tenants preferred revisions in the High Court.  The High Court has upheld the finding of fact recorded by the District Judge that the premises were sub-let without the consent of the landlord. However, still the High Court has granted relief to the sub-tenants and denied relief of eviction to the landlord.  The High Court has formed an opinion that in spite of the sub-tenants having been illegally  inducted into the premises, the original tenant had died and the sub-tenants were holding under the legal representatives of the original tenant and the sub-tenants deserved to be shown mercy.  The High Court directed the rent which was being paid by the sub-tenants at the rate of Rs.600/- per month to be enhanced to Rs.1000/- per month and that too directly to the landlord bypassing  the tenant and having done so directed the claim for eviction to be dismissed.  Consequently, these two appeals by special leave have been filed by the landlord. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are satisfied that the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained. During the pendency of these appeals, the Act of 1961 has been repealed and replaced by the Karnataka Rent Control Act, 1999 with effect from 31.12.1999.  Dealing with Section 70 of the New Act we have today held in M/s Mahendra Saree Emporium Vs. G.V. Srinivasa Murthy (Civil Appeal No.6296 of 1998 decided on August 27, 2004) that these appeals shall not abate and shall be heard and decided as if the 1999 Act was not passed. The sole question which arises for decision in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in refusing to evict the tenant and the sub-tenants simply because the original tenant had died and the sub-tenants deserved to be treated with mercy.  The High Court drew support from the decision of this Court in A.S. Sulochana Vs. C. Dharmalingam (1987) 1 SCC 180 according to which if the sub-tenancy was created by a tenant and the tenant had died then the legal heirs of the tenant and the sub-tenants could not be evicted ""for the sin committed by the deceased tenant"".  The view of the law so taken in  A.S. Sulochana’s case, stands overruled. (See Parvinder Singh Vs. Renu Gautam and Ors. \026 (2004) 4 SCC 794).   The sub-tenancy was created  in 1978 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 without the consent of the tenant.  The finding as to creation of sub-tenancy has been recorded by the learned District Judge on appreciation of evidence within his jurisdiction and has been upheld by the High Court.  We find no reason to interfere with that finding of fact.  The legal consequences must therefore follow.  The landlord has successfully made out a ground for eviction and the tenant must be evicted along with the sub-tenants. The appeals are allowed.  The judgment of the High Court is set aside and instead that of the District Judge is restored. However, the decree for eviction shall remain suspended for a period of four months from today subject to the tenant and the sub- tenants filing the usual undertaking within a period of four weeks from today in the Executing Court.  The appellant shall be entitled to costs throughout from the respondent-tenant and sub-tenants.",The High Court upheld the finding of fact recorded by the District Judge that the premises were sub-let without the consent of the landlord.

Sreekumar, (N.P.) for the Petitioners. V.C. Mahajan, A.K. Panda, Ms. C.K. Sucharita, and Ms. A. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Subhashini for the Respondents. The Court delivered the following Order: One  of  the matters which arises for  consideration  in this  Writ  Petition  is as to how  the  provisions  of  the inter-state  Migrant Workmen (Regulation of  Employment  and Conditions  of Service) Act, 1979, and particularly of  sec- tion  20 thereof can be enforced. In the affidavit filed  by the  Union  of India in the Ministry of labour it  has  been stated that in view of the scheme contained in section 20(3) of  the Act that officer of the Originating State  can  make enquiries within the Recepient State provided the  Recepient State  agrees  to  such Officers of  the  Originating  State operating within that State, the law has not become workable in a proper way. This is a beneficial legislation for satis- fying the provisions of the Constitution and the  obligation in international agreements to which India is a party. We do not  think  there  can be any valid  justification  for  not permitting  the  officers of the Originating State  to  hold appropriate  enquiries in the Recepient State in  regard  to persons  of the Originating State working as migrant  labour in  the Recepient State. We do not think that there  is  any necessity  to hear the other States before making  an  order for enforcing section 20(3) and to give effect to the legis- lative intention contained therein. Mr.  Panda appearing for the State of Orissa has  agreed that Orissa State has no objection to officers of any origi- nating State holding necessary enquiries within Orissa  when it is a Recepient State. We would, therefore, make a  direc- tion  that  to implement the provisions of the Act  of  1979 referred  to above every State and Union Territory in  India would be obliged to permit Officers of originating States of migrant labour for holding appropriate inquiries within  the limits of the Recepient States for enforcement of the  stat- ute  and no Recepient State shall place any embargo or  hin- drance in such process. Copy of this order shall be sent  to the  Chief Secretary of every State and Union Territory  for compliance. We  are cognizant of the fact that this order has been  made with- 392 out  hearing  the  States other than Orissa  and  the  Union Territories. In the event of any State or Union Territory is of the opinion that the direction should be modified, liber- ty is given to apply for modification of the order but until it is modified it shall remain in force. The Writ  Petitions are disposed of with this order. No costs. T.N.A.

In  all fairness, the  counsel for  the respondents  had stated that hypotheca, namely,  the factory  premises situated  at  G.T.

In case the property is not sufficient, then  it would  be open  to the  respondents  to proceed for  the recovery  of the  dues by proceeding agaist other  orders   or  proceedings   accordance  with  law.  We appreciate the  fair stand  taken by the learned counsel for the respondents.  Accordingly, the  appellant is at liberty, in the  first instance,  to proceed  with the  sale  of  the aforesaid property  and realise  the decretal  debt from the sale proceeds and to have the same satisfied with the decree in execution.  In case  there is  any shortfall, it would be open to  the appellants  to proceed against any other assets or personally  against any  other defendants  in  accordance with law.

" ORDER 1.   This  appeal by special leave arises from the order  of the   High   Court  of  Madhva  Pradesh   at   Jabalpur   in Misc.Petition No.484 of 1987, dated 5.1.1988. 2.   Notification under section (4) of the Land  Acquisition Act  was issued acquiring a large extent of 387.50 acres  of land for submergence of Barna Dam irrigation project in  the State of M.P. The lands of the appellant were also required. The  Land  Acquisition Officer by his award  dated  5.9.1969 awarded compensation to the appellant.  Thereafter, it would appear  that  the appellant had  received  the  compensation granted by the Land Acquisition Officer without protest but, according to the appellant, it was under protest.  Be it  as it  may,  on the rejection of the reference,  the  appellant filed  a  revision before the District Judge  in  1982.   By order  dated  20.6.82, the District Judge rejected  the  re- vision.   In 1987, the appellant filed the Writ Petition  in the High Court which was dismissed by the High Court on  the ground  of  inordinate delay.  It was held that  though  the Collector had rejected the reference on 2.4.75, the revision was filed in the Tribunal and the District Judge rejected it on 29.6.83. The petitioner who had slept over the matter for more  than 5 years, filed the Writ Petition.  From the  date of the order of the L.A. Collector till date of filling  the writ  petition  more than 10 years have  elapsed.   On  that ground the High Court refused to grant the relief. 3.   The  State  Legislature of M.P. amended clause  (b)  of sub-s.(2) of sec. 18 and inserted sub-s.(3)thus: ""Any  order  made  by  the  Collector  on  the application   under  this  section  shall   be subject  to the revision by the High Court  as if the collector were the Court subordinate to the  High Court within the meaning of  section 115 C.P.C."" Thus,  it could be seen that against the order of  rejection http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of  reference by the Collector on 2 5.75  only  jurisdiction that could be exercised as per the amendment is by the  High Court  under s.115 C.P.C. Thereby, by exercise of the  power by  District  Judge  in  this  behalf  is  clearly   without authority of law or jurisdiction.  The order of the District Judge, therefore, is a nullity. 4.   Then we have to see whether the appellant was justified in  approaching the High Court after an inordinate delay  of more  than  10  years  from the date of  the  order  of  the Collector  or at any rate from the date of the order  passed by the District Judge.  The High Court exercised its  juris- diction under Art.226 but not under s. 115 C.P.C. Even if it is to be converted as a revision under Sec. 115 C.P.C.,  the order  of  the High Court is not vitiated by  any  error  of jurisdiction or material irregularity in the exercise of its jurisdiction.   The  High  Court  has  rightly  refused   to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction after an  inordinate delay of more than 5 years from the date of the order of the District Judge and more than 10 years from the date of the 96 order  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Collector.   Under  these circumstances, we do not think that it is a case  warranting interference by this Court under Article 136. 5.The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" JUDGMENT O  R  D  E  R Heard learned counsel for the parties. The sole appellant was convicted by the Trial Court under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay fine of Rs.500/-; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of fifteen days. On appeal being preferred, the High Court confirmed the conviction.  Hence, this appeal by special leave. In the present case, the conviction of the appellant is based upon the evidence of Smt. Chandrabhagabai (P.W.4), who is an eye-witness to the occurrence, and immediately after the occurrence, she disclosed about the same to Asha Bhanudas Mohite (P.W.2), who is nobody else than her grand daughter.  The evidence of these two witnesses is corroborated by the medical evidence.  In our view, the High Court was quite justified in upholding the conviction of the the plea of appellant and rejected the case of the defence in relation to/ ....2/ - 2 - insanity as for proving the same, the defence has not adduced any evidence whatsoever.  This being the position, no ground for interference is made out.

Pending the  suit, though  several  opportunities  were given, no  evidence was  adduced by the defendant. The court passed an  order  on  September  22,  1995  foreclosing  the evidence of  the defendant  on the  statement of the counsel that the  first  defendant  was  not  willing  to  lead  any evidence. An  application for  impleadment was filed earlier by the  appellant who  is a  subsequent purchaser  from  the first defendant. After impleadment, he filed application for adduction of evidence which was rejected. Thus this appeal.

" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 196 The following Order of the Court delivered by : Both the appeals are disposed of by a common judgment since same point is involved for adjudication. These appeals by Special Leave arise from the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana in Civil Writ Petition No. 2636/86 dated August 13,1986 and Civil Writ Petition No. 2719/86 of the Judgment. Admittedly the appellants were holding substantive posts as head-constables. They were sent to undergo intermediate course of training in the year 1976 and they were put in the ’G’ list and they were temporary promoted as officiating Sub-Inspectors on May 1, 1981, Thereafter on April 1, 1994 they were selected for undergoing training of upper school course at police training college, Phillaue in Distt. Jullundur. After completion of the training instead of promoting them as inspectors in the meantime they were reverted as head-constables. They filed writ petitions as stated earlier and the High Court dismissed the writ petitions. It is seen from the proceedings Annexure - P at page the writ petitions. It is seen from the proceedings Annexure-P at page 32 of the Paper Book that the appellants were not promoted as Inspectors. Though the appellants have completed the upper school course ending with the August, 1984 they have been ignored and not included on the E List due to their chequerred service record. Mota Singh and Karnail Singh though have been categorised in that category, in paragraph 4 of the same order they have been promoted on ad hoc basis w.e.f. October 4, 1984. Admit-tedly Mota singh, head constable No.80/119 and Karnail Singh head con-stable 82/22 are juniors to the appellants in the seniority mentioned in the order. When the appellants have been standing in the same position as Mota Singh and Karnail Singh and seniors to them necessarily they should also get the same treatment. Unfortunately that was meted out: It is sought to be contended on behalf of the State that due to bad record and adverse confidential report, they have not been given the promotion. Even assuming that they had adverse remarks, admittedly no enquiry was made, no findings were given after conducting an enquiry and after giving an opportunity to the appellants. Therefore, the reversion of them as head-con-stables is dearly illegal Though they have been promoted subsequently in 1987-88 respectively, they must be deemed to have been promoted oa par with juniors w.e.f. October 8, 1984. The appellants are accordingly entitled to the above declaration and the consequential benefits. The appeals are allowed and writ issued.

IA No. 12 This application  is made  by Delhi Outdoor Advertisers Association.  The   prayer  in   the  application   is   for clarification/modification of  the order  dated November 20, 1997 in  so far as it relates to the direction given therein for the removal of all hoardings which are on road-sides and which are  a disturbance  to safe  traffic movement.  Having heard Shri  G.Ramaswamy,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the applicant, and  the learned  amicus curiae, we are satisfied that this  application must be rejected. We have perused the notice published  by the  Commissioner of M.C.D. warning all advertisers/owners of  hoardings in  Delhi  to  remove  such hoardings and  also the  notices issued thereafter as result of non-compliance  of the  notice by  some persons.  We  are satisfied that  the steps  taken are in the proper direction to identify  and remove  these hoardings.  Shri  G.Ramaswamy submitted  the   order  enables   the  authorities   to  act arbitrarily and  to remove  any hoarding at their will which should not correct. The order made by this Court on November 20, 1997,  which was  duly publicised  has directed  in  the order itself  publicity through  the electronic media and is obviously well-known  to every one. The applicants belong to a category  who would  undoubtedly be aware of the order and its  requirement.   Even  thereafter,   a  notice  requiring compliance was  published in the newspapers and in addition, in case  of  continuing  default,  individual  notices  were issued some of some of which were shown to us by the learned counsel. There  is, thus,  sufficient notice to every person and  no  further  notice  of  the  kind  suggested  by  Shri Ramaswamy  is   required  to  any  advertiser/owner  of  the hoardings. The  order dated November 20, 1997 is quite clear and has  also been  correctly understood  by the authorities and all  concerned. It  directs the  authourities to ‘remove all  hoardings   which  are  on  road-sides  and  which  are hazardous and a disturbance to safe traffic movement’. There http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 is  ambiguity  in  the  order.  It  is  obvious  that  every hoarding, other  than traffic  signs and  road signs  on the road-sides have  to be  removed irrespective  of  its  kind; every hoarding  irrespective of  whether it  is on the road- side of  not which  is hazardous  and a  disturbance to safe traffic movement  so as  to adversely  affect free  and safe flow  of  traffic  is  required  to  be  identified  by  the authorities and  promptly which  is a  disturbance  to  safe traffic movement has to be a hoarding visible to the traffic on the  road.  No  other  detail  or  further  guideline  is required for appreciating this order and its implementation. Even though the order dated 20.11.1997 was explicit and very clear, yet  these further  observations are made to leave on one in  any doubt  of the  content and  requirement  of  out order. We reiterate  the direction  given in  our order  dated November 20,  1997 that the order made by us even in respect of  the   hoardings  is   required  to  be  required  to  be implemented  notwithstanding   any   other   or   directions including stay  orders/injunctions granted by any authority, court or tribunal to the contrary.

" L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J J U D G M E N T S.  N.  VARIAVA, J. These  Appeals are against a Judgment dated 6th March, 1996.   The  parties will be referred to in the capacity  in Civil Appeal No.  410 of 1997.  Briefly stated the facts are as  follows:  The Appellant is the Union who is representing the  cause  of  a  workman  by  name  Nagarajan.   The  said Nagarajan   was  appointed  as  a  Trainee  Chemist  in  the Respondent  Company  on 25th May, 1962.  On  15th  February, 1973   Nagarajan  and  others   were  appointed  as   Junior Management Assistants on a consolidated pay.  They were then put  on  a service contract for 5 years.  On  17th  January, 1977  Nagarajan was transferred as Technical  Representative to Chennai.  In 1986 the Junior Management Assistants raised a dispute which was referred to the Industrial Tribunal.  By an  Award  dated  29th December, 1986 it was held  that  the Junior   Management  Assistants  were   workmen  under   the Industrial  Disputes  Act.  It was, however, held  that  the Sales  Representative would not be a workman.  On 25th July, 1988  Nagarajan  was transferred as a Sales  Representative. The said Nagarajan refused to accept the transfer and raised an   industrial  dispute  challenging   his  transfer  to  a non-workman  category.   This  dispute was referred  to  the Industrial  Tribunal  on 22nd December, 1989.  The  Tribunal rejected  this  demand  on  7th February,  1992.   The  Writ Petition  which was filed was dismissed on 23rd April, 1994. A  Appeal  was  filed  against the  dismissal  of  the  Writ Petition.   In  that  Appeal, on 16th  February,  1996,  the Management  gave  an  undertaking that  Nagarajan  would  be treated  as  a  technical  staff and  given  benefits  as  a workman.   We are informed that pursuant to this undertaking Nagarajan  has joined duty.  The Appeal came to be dismissed by  the  impugned Judgment dated 6th March, 1996.   However, the  Appellate Court directed the Respondent Company to  pay 25%  back  wages,  provided Nagarajan immediately  join  the duty.   Against  this  Judgment the Union  has  filed  Civil Appeal No.  410 of 1997 and the Respondent Company has filed Civil  Appeal No.  392 of 1997.  We have heard the  parties, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 read  the  impugned Judgment as well as the Judgment of  the Single  Judge  and the Award of the Tribunal.  In our  view, there is no infirmity either in the Award or in the Judgment of  the  Single  Judge or in the Judgment  of  the  Division Bench.   The  employee Nagarajan had refused to  accept  the transfer  order  and  refused to report for duty  after  his transfer.  We see no substance in the contention that he was entitled  not  to join.  In our view the dispute could  have been  raised and agitated even after joining.  There was  no justification  for  not  reporting for duty.   In  spite  of Nagarajan  not having worked he has been awarded 25% of back wages.   This was within the discretion of the Court and  we see  no  reason  to  interfere.   At  the  request  of   the Appellants  in C.A.  No.  392 of 1997, they are granted time of  eight  weeks  from today to pay 25% of the  back  wages. Accordingly,  both the Appeals stand dismissed.

It is not in dispute that this Court  Sn C.A. No.3673 of 1988 titled G.P. Lal vs. Coal India Ltd.  had struck down the rule as violative of Article 14 of  the Constitution. Consequently, the rule was never in vogue to invoke the exercise of the power by the appellants. The question then is: what would be the position of the respondents? lt  is not  far to  seek that  when  charge  of dereliction  of   duty  was   Imputed  to   both  the  first respondents, it  was necessary to hold an enquiry to give an opportunity to  them before  taking any  disciplinary action for the  alleged dereliction  of the duty. It is, therefore, necessary that  the appellant should hold an enquiry against both the  first respondents giving reasonable opportunity to them according  to the rule. Constitution bench rendered the decision in Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderaded & Ors. vs. B. Karnukar &  Ors. [(1993)  4  SCC  7274  had  held  that  the delinquent must  be deemed  to be  under suspension  pending enquiry.

The appellant-Trust filed objection stating that the appellant  had deposited  more than  what was due to the respondents, Therefore,  the execution  application deserves to  be  dismissed.  The  objection  was  over-ruled  and  on revision, the  High Court  confirmed  the  same.  Thus  this appeal by special leave.

" REVIEW JURISDICTION : Review Petition No. 62A of 1974. Petition  for  review of this Court’s Order dated  the  18th January, 1974 in Spl.  Leave Petition No. 2788 of 1973. C.  K.  Daphtary, S. K. Dholakia and R. C. Bhatia,  for  the petitioner. S. V. Tambwaker, for the respondents The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.  Mr. Daphtary, learned  counsel  for  the petitioners, has argued at length all the points which  were urged  at  the earlier stage when we refused  special  leave http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 thus  making out that a review proceeding virtually  amounts to  re-hearing.   May  be, we were  not  right  in  refusing special  leave  in the first round; but, once an  order  has been passed by this Court, a review thereof must be  subject to the rules of the game and cannot be lightly  entertained. A  review  of  a judgment is a serious  step  and  reluctant resort  to  it is proper only where a  glaring  omission  or patent  mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier  by judicial fallibility.  A mere repetition, through  different counsel, of old and over-ruled arguments, a second trip over ineffectually   covered   ground  or   minor   mistakes   of inconsequential import are obviously insufficient.  The very strict  need  for  compliance  with  these  factors  is  the rationale  behind  the insistence of  counsel’s  certificate which should not be a routine affair or a habitual step.  It is neither fairness to the court which decided nor awareness of  the precious public time lost what with a huge  back-log of dockets waiting in the queue for disposal, for counsel to issue  easy  certificates for entertainment  of  review  and fight  over again the same battle which has been fought  and lost.  The Bench 934 and  the  Bar,  we are sure, are jointly  concerned  in  the conservation of judicial time for maximum use.  We regret to say  that  this  case  is typical  of  the  unfortunate  but frequent  phenomenon of repeat performance with  the  review label  as passport.  Nothing which we did not hear then  has been heard now, except a couple of rulings on points earlier put forward.  May be, as counsel now urges and then pressed, our order refusing special leave was capable of a  different course.  The present stage is not a virgin ground but review of  an  earlier  order  which  has  the  normal  feature  of finality. We  dismiss  the  petition unhesitatingly,  but  with  these observations, hopefully. V.M.K.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R NON-REPORTABLE CIVIL APPEAL NO 2351 OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP (C) 11968 of 2007] 1.      Leave granted. 2.      In our view, this appeal can be disposed of on a very short point.  The respondents, Bharat Singh Bhati & Ors. filed a writ application before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore claiming relief that a minimum of pay-scale from the respective dates of their initial appointment be paid to them as had been paid to other similarly situated persons and for other incidental reliefs. 3.      This writ petition was disposed of by directing payment of the minimum pay-scale from the respective dates of their initial appointment.  From the order of the High Court, it would be evident that the High Court had noted that return to the writ petition was filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh, appellant herein, although, admittedly, no such return was filed. 4.      An application for review of the order of the High Court allowing the writ petition of the respondents was filed, which was also rejected.  A writ appeal against the original order of the learned Single Judge of the High Court allowing the writ application was also filed. The said appeal was also dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh holding that in view of the rejection of the Review Application, the writ appeal could not be entertained. 5.      Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid orders of the learned Single Judge as well as of the Division Bench of the High Court, this Special Leave Petition has been filed, which was heard on grant of leave in presence of the learned counsel for the parties. 6.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and considering the fact that return was in fact not filed by the appellants, we are of the view that the High Court was not justified in allowing the writ application without affording any opportunity of filing return to the writ application filed by the respondents.  In that view of the matter, we set aside all the orders passed by the learned Single Judge in the writ petition as well as in the Review Application and also the order passed in the writ appeal.  The appellants shall file their return to the petition within six weeks from the date of supply of a copy of this order to the High Court and the High Court, thereafter, shall dispose of the writ application after giving hearing to the parties within a period of three months from the date of filing the return to the writ application by passing a reasoned and speaking order in accordance with law. 7.      Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.  There will be no order as to costs.","The respondents, Bharat Singh Bhati & Ors. filed a writ application before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore.

" THE 1ST DAY OF MAY, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mrs. Justice Sujata V.Manohar Mrs. Chandan Ramamurthi, Adv. for the appellant B.Datta, Sr.Adv.  and S.B.Upadhyay,  Adv. with  him for  the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: This appeal  by special  leave arises against the order of the  High Court  of Himachal Pradesh made on 9.12.1994 in C.W.P.No.435/92.  The appellant was initially appointed as a Store Munshi  on 4.10.71  in the work-charged establishment. Later ,  he had  two promotions,  last of  them being  Store Keeper in the regular cadre on December 31, 1980 in the pay- scale of  Rs. 260-430/-  w.e.f.  1.1.1981.    He  was  later promoted  on   1.1.1986  in  the  grade  of  Rs.  330-560/-. Subsequently, by  virtue of  negotiation with the Union, the pay-scale and  the promotional  avenues of  the work charged employees, who  could not  get promotion,  were rationalised and  by   modified  scheme  dated  September  5,  1988,  the respondents  had  adopted  rationalisation  scheme  and  the scales of  pay.   Para (b)  of  the  scheme  envisages  that although appointment  to the regular cadre will be effective from the date of such appointment, service rendered from the date of  such appointment,  service rendered in work charged posts in  the same  post and scale of pay will count towards inter-se seniority  in the  regular cadre for the purpose of promotion to  next higher  scale of  pay subject  to line of promotion being available. It is  not in  dispute that  the appellant  earlier was promoted on selection and became a regular employee.  Though the work  charged employees who could not become the regular employees  have   the  benefit   of  rationalisation  scheme referred to hereinbefore, since the appellant was in a lower scale of  pay in  the work-charged  establishment  than  was mentioned in the rationalisation scheme, he cannot claim the higher scale  of pay  or promotional  post on  par with  his erstwhile juniors/workcharged  employees.   The High  Court, therefore, has rightly pointed out that though the appellant http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 is entitled  to count  his service  rendered as  workcharged employee for  the purpose of seniority and promotion, as far as the  grade seniority is concerned, he cannot get the same benefit as he was appointed in the grade of Rs. 260-350/- on September 1,  1973 and  regularised w.e.f.  1.1.1981 in  the scale of  Rs. 260-430/-  which is  lower pay-scale than what was rationalised.  Under these circumstances, we do not find any illegality in the order passed by the High Court. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Each convicted accused was sentenced for two years’ rigorous imprisonment for the offence under Section 148 IPC and fine of Rs.500/-; five years’ rigorous imprisonment for offence under Section 307/149 IPC and fine of Rs.500/-; and 3 years’ rigorous imprisonment for offence under Section 324/149 IPC and fine of Rs.500/-. In case of default of payment of fine, the accused persons shall undergo additional rigorous imprisonment for 6 months under Section 148 IPC, one year under Section 307/149 IPC and 6 months under Section 324/149 IPC. 2.      The convicted accused persons filed an appeal before the High Court and the High Court by its judgment dated 10.2.2005 affirmed the conviction and sentence of all the six accused persons but reduced their sentence under Section 307/149 IPC from 5 years to 4 years. 3.      The present appeal by way of special leave has been filed by accused Shakeel only. 4.      The case of the prosecution is that on 8.4.1997 at about 4.00 p.m. when complainant Bharat Kumar (PW.1) with his mother Leelabai (PW.2), brother Naresh Kumar and father were sitting in their house at Village Tagore Bedi, all the accused persons attacked them and as a result of which they suffered injuries.  In support of its case, the prosecution had examined PW.1 Bharat Kumar (complainant) and PW.2 Leelabai.  PW.1 in his statement has not named Shakeel as the person who  had attacked him.  In paragraph 16 of his deposition he has stated that when he reached at the Police Station, Shakeel was standing there and informed PW.1 that first he (PW.1) should get his brother treated and thereafter  should lodge a report.  PW.2 Leelabai in her statement has admitted that she did not know any of the accused persons and the name of Shakeel was informed to her by her son. There is no test identification parade conducted by the police to lend support to the identification of the accused persons.  In the absence of any evidence against Shakeel, the Sessions Judge and the High Court have wrongly convicted the accused-appellant. 5.

This application has been filed for clarification of a judgment and order dated 28.04.2006 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2335 of 2006. 2.      The clarification has been sought for on the issue as to whether 13.05.1992 was the cut-off date for commencement of the period of one year for converting supply from 11 KV to 33 KV or higher voltage or the surcharge was actually payable with effect from the said date. 3.

The relevant paragraph of the judgment of this Court, accordingly, may be substituted by the following: \021For the reasons aforementioned, although Mr. R.K. Jain, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the company, may be right in his submission that the Board has no jurisdiction to levy surcharge after 29.01.1992, but as the said contention had not been raised and furthermore as notice was issued by the court on a limited question, we are of the opinion that the company is liable to pay the surcharge with effect from the date of expiry of one year from 13.05.1992.  We may furthermore notice that the actual amount of surcharge payable from that date has already been paid by the company to the Board.  However, in view of our findings aforementioned, there cannot be any doubt that the surcharge @ 17 =% was not required to be paid in terms of the tariff  notification dated 01.02.1994.\022 The I.A. is disposed of accordingly.",This application has been filed for clarification of a judgment and order dated 28.04.2006 passed by a Division Bench of this Court.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  dated June  1,1995 made  by the  Punjab & Haryana High Court  in Civil  Writ Petition  No. 3790  of 1994.  The first respondent,  claiming to be a freedom fighter, made on application on  August 1, 1972 for pension under the Freedom Fighters’ Pension  Scheme framed by the Government of India. The  Primary   evidence  in   support  of   his   undergoing imprisonment for  six months has been based on a Certificate of an HLA and co-prisoner. The certificate was considered by the appellant  Government, as per the directions of the High Court in  an earlier writ petition, and it is round that the respondent was  not a  freedom fighter  and, therefore,  not entitled to  the pension under the Freedom Fighters’ Pension Scheme. The respondents again challenged the decision in the present writ  petition. The High Court in the impugned order has held  that in  view of  the  evidence  produced  by  the respondents,  they   must  be   declared  freedom  fighters. Accordingly, the writ petition has been allowed. Hence, this appeal by special leave. This court  in Mukund  Lal Bhandari & Ors. Vs. Union of India &  Ors. [(1993)  Supp. 3  SCC 2 (para 6)] had held, as regards the sufficiency of the proof, that the scheme itself mentions the  documents which  are required  to be  produced before the  Government. It is not possible for this Court to scrutinize the  documents which according to the petitioners they had  produced in  support of their claim, and pronounce upon their genuineness. It is the function of the Government to do so. We would, therefore, direct accordingly. It is  seen  that  the  High  Court  had  directed  the Government, in  the earlier writ petition, and in compliance thereof the Government of India had considered the documents relied upon  by the  respondents and came to the conclusion, as a  fact, that  these  documents  are  not  sufficient  to conclude that the respondents had suffered imprisonment. The http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 High Court  found it,  on appreciation  of evidence,  to  be sufficient, which the High Court cannot embark upon.

This was the  view taken  all  the  way  upto  the  Customs,  Excise  and  Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, whose order is under challenge before  us.  The Tribunal decided in favour of the assessee, agreeing with the argument of its counsel that the exclusion in  clause  1A was only of styrene butadiene rubber and  oil extended  styrene  butadiene rubber and did not cover  other forms of styrene butadiene. It  will be seen that the principal clause of the said exemption  notification  ’exempts  raw  rubber,  natural  or synthetic  rubber,  latex, natural or synthetic ......""  The principal  clause of the said notification, therefore, makes a  distinction  between  rubber, natural or  synthetic,  and latex, natural or synthetic.  Bearing this in mind, one has to  read  clause 1A of the ?aid notification.  It says  that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the  said notification shall not apply to ""styrene butadiene rubber  and  oil  extended  styrene  butadiene  rubber.""  it covers,  therefore,  the  rubber  but not  the  latex.   Our attent-on  was drawn by learned counsel for the appellant to item  40.02 of the Schedule contained in Customs Tariff Act, 1975  where  styrene  butadiene rubber is  shown  under  two sub-heads,  ’Latex’ and ’Others’, and it was submitted  that the styrene butadiene rubber referred to in clause 1A of the said  notification  should,  therefore,   also  be  read  as covering  latex.   For  the  reason  that  we  have  already .stated, we cannot agree. Clause 1A of the said notification is in the nature of an  exception  to the principal clause thereof and  must  be construed  with regard to that principal clause.   Secondly, as  has been rightly pointed out by learned counsel for  the assessee,  clause 1A is applicable not to styrene  butadiene generally  but  to  two  categories  of  styrene  butadiene, namely,  styrene  butadiene rubber and oil extended  styrene butadiene rubber.

No.349 in village Japuwal,  Tehsil   and  District   Gurdaspur  and  also  for possession of  the property.  It is  his  case  that  he  is adopted son  of one  Isher Singh  and that  while he  was in possession and enjoyment of the property, the petitioner had disputed his  title to  and interest  in the  said land  and filed a  suit. The  petitioner had  pleaded in  the  written statement that  Isher Singh had no title in the property and they set up the title in Darbar Sahib and that he had gifted the property  in favour  of Darbar  Sahib. Subsequently, the parties, on the basis of issues raised, adduced evidence. At the  end   of  the   trial,  the  petitioner  had  filed  an application under Order 6, Rule 17, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for  amendment of  the written  statement pleading that Isher Singh  had gifted  over the  property to Darbar Sahib, Amritsar Shromani Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee and it was in possession  as a  legatee  of  the  property.  There  was neither an  issue nor  any evidence  adduced in that behalf. Therefore, the  High Court  hes set  aside the  order on two grounds,  namely,   one,  though   inconsistent  pleas   are permissible to  be taken in the written statement, this case is not  one of inconsistence but mutually destructive of the pleadings and two, for unexplained delay. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in the High Court  conceded that  there is  to explanation  for not taking that  plea in the written statement and for coming up with an  application  for  amendment  at  a  belated  stage. However, he  contended that they have remotely stated in the written statement  that Isher  Singh had gifted the property but by  way of amendment what the petitioner would be making specific amendment in the written statement. That contention was not accepted by the High Court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The same  contention has  been reiterated before us. We find no  force in  the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the pleading does contain the gift clause in the original  written statement  and that it is sought to be elaborated by  obtaining proper  documents at  this  belated stage. It  is settled  law  that  the  defendant  can  raise mutually inconsistent  pleadings in the written statement it is for  the Court  to  consider  whether  the  case  can  be properly considered  in deciding the issue. But in this case the plea  in the  written statement is mutually destructive. In the  first written  statement, they have denied the title of Isher  Singh himself. When such is the situation, how can they set  up a  title in  him and  plead gift  made by Isher Singh in  favour of  the petitioner-Committee.  Under  these circumstances, the  High Court  has rightly refused to grant the plaint.  Moreover, there  is no  explanation given as to why they  came forward  with this  plea at the belated stage after the  parties had  adduced the  evidence and the matter was to the argued. Under these circumstances, we do not find any error  of jurisdiction  or material  irregularity in the exercise of jurisdiction warranting interference. The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.","The petition was filed against the order of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana made on May 17, 1996.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.579 OF 2008 [ARISING OUT OF SLP (CRIMINAL) NO.2054 OF 2007] 1.      Leave granted. 2.      It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that there was no intention to kill the deceased Savithri and thus their conviction under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code by the courts below was not proper. 3.      We have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants.  The nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased has been referred to in paragraph nos.21, 22 and 23 by the High Court which read as under: ""21.    It was lastly contended that the deceased intervened and A-3 to A-5 attacked her and this would not come under the ambit of the offence under Section 302 IPC.  It is also contended that A-5 caused only contusion on the face of the deceased and as such, if at all, he could be convicted only for the lesser offence. 22.     We are not impressed with the submission.  Ex. P-13 post mortem certificate shows that the deceased Savithri sustained injury on the head with bleeding in the scalp on the left temporal and right temporal parietal region and the membranes were intact and that there was ""subural haemorrhage in the left fronto-parietal and right tempero parietal region"" and the bleeding into the brain matter in the temporal region cortical and subcortical areas.  In Ex. P.15 final opinion, PW.12 Doctor would state that the deceased ""died due to shock and haemorrhage due to extensive head injury-subarachnoid haemorrhage and bleeding into the brain matter"". 23.     So, the details of the injuries found in Exhibits P-13 and P-15 would clearly indicate that a heavy force had been employed by A-3 to A-5 to cause injuries on the head of the deceased, which resulted in her death by causing injuries on the very brain matter.  Therefore, in our view, the conviction and sentence imposed on A-3 to A-5 are perfectly justified and the same are to be confirmed."" 4.      From a perusal of the aforesaid reasoning given by the High Court, we are satisfied that there was an intention to cause death of the deceased on the part of the accused\026appellants and thus we do not find any good or sufficient reason to interfere with the sentence imposed on them. 5.      The appeal is dismissed accordingly.",A-3 and A-5 were found guilty of killing Savithri. The case was heard at the Delhi High Court in 2007.

" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 747 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The respondent was initially granted Mining lease in the year 1966 for a period of 20 years to extract limestone in the forest area. The Forest (Conservation) Act 69 of 1980 has come into force with effect from 25.10.80. Under Section 2 of the Act grant or renewal after the Act has come into force shall be made, in the event of the State Government deciding to grant lease or renewal, with the prior approval of the Central Government. The object of the Act is to maintain ecology and preservation of the forest. It is also the object under Section 3 to regenerate the forests by planting trees and the forest growth. In 1986 after the expiry of the lease the respondent had approached the Government for renewal. Though the Government had taken the decision and passed an order on February 7, 1986 to grant further renewal for a period of 20 years in terras of the original grant, it was objected to by the Forest Department. Consequently it was cancelled. The respondent had approached the High Court in Miscellaneous Petition No. 2758 of 89 and the Division Bench by its order dated August 18, 1989 following the ratio in State of Bihar v, Banshi Ram Modi and Others, (A.I.R. 1985 S.C. 814) directed to grant renewal on the ground that the part of the leased area had already been broken and, therefore, renewal should be granted. The appellant contends that this Court in Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of U.P., (A.I.R. 1988 SC 2187) and Ambica Quarry Works etc. v. State of Gujarat and Others, (A.I.R. 1987 SC 1073) had held that even the renewal of the lease cannot be granted without the prior occurrence of the Central Government. We find force in the contention. It is settled law that the grant or renewal is a fresh grant and mast be made consistent with law. Section 2 prohibited the grant or renewal. In case the State Government decides to grant fresh lease or renewal of the lease it is mandatory that it should obtain prior approval of the Central Government. Admittedly, no prior approval of the Central Government had been obtained under Section 2 of the Act. The State Government thus had realised the mistake in directing renewal when the Forest Department had objected to the renewal of the lease in favour of the respondent"". Therefore, the cancellation of the order, before it came into effect by registering, had been properly made by the appellant. The High Court was, therefore, not right in directing grant of renewal of the lease. It is brought to our notice that under contempt proceedings the lease deed was directed to be registered and it was accordingly registered. It is declared that the registration is illegal and is invalid. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.",The Forest (Conservation) Act 69 of 1980 has come into force with effect from 25.10.80.

" Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice A.S. Anand Hon’ble Mr. Justice K.T. Thomas J.S. Attri, Devendra Singh, Advs. for the appellant T. Sridharan and P.D. Sharma, Advs. for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. The appellant  was appointed  as Voluntary  Teacher  on tenure basis  under the  Voluntary Teachers  Primary  Scheme 1991. Respondent  No.4 challenged  his  appointment  on  the basis that  he was  academically more  meritorious than  the appellant and that the Selection Committee was not justified in awarding him 21 marks in viva voce as against 16 marks to respondent No.  4. The State Administrative Tribunal allowed the application of respondent No.4 and quashed the selection of the  appellant. The  appellant has  put the  order of the State Administrative  Tribunal dated  10th December  1992 in issue. The State Administrative Tribunal, in our opinion, fell in complete  error in  judging the  comparative merit of the candidates and  finding fault  with the award of 21 marks in viva voce  to the  appellant as  against 16 marks awarded to respondent No.4.  The Tribunal  exceeded its jurisdiction in entering  into   the  field  exclusively  reserved  for  the selection  committee.   The  finding   that  the   appellant ‘manipulated’ his selection is not supported by any material and reason and is purely a conjectural finding. In Dalpat  Abasahe Solunke.  etc. etc.  Vs. Dr. B.S. Mahajan etc. etc.  (AIR 1990  SC 434),  while dealing with some what identical question, this court opined: ""It is  needless to  emphasise that it is not the function of the Court to hear  appeals over the decisions of the  Selection Committees and to scrutinize the  relative merits  of the candidate.  Whether a candidate is fit for a particular post or not has  to  be  decided  by  the  duly constituted   Selection   Committee http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 which  has  the  expertise  on  the subject.  The  court  has  no  such expertise.  The   decision  of  the Selection Committee  can interfered with only  on limited grounds, such as illegality  or  patent  material irregularity in the constitution of the  Committee   or  its  procedure vitiating the  selection, or proved mala fides  affecting the selection etc. It is not disputed that in the present  case  the  University  has constituted the  Committee  in  due compliance   with    the   relevant status. The  Committee consisted of experts   and   it   selected   the candidates after  going through all the relevant material before it. In sitting   in    appeal   over   the selection so made an in comparative merits   of   the   candidates   as assessed by  the  Court,  the  High Court went  wrong and  exceeded its jurisdiction."" The above  observation apply  to the  facts of  present case with full force. In the  instant case the selection of the appellant was quashed by  the Tribunal  by finding fault with the award of 21 marks in viva voce to the appellant without assigning any reasons. The  selection of  the appellant was not quashed on any other  ground. The  order  of  the  Tribunal  under  the circumstances cannot  be sustained.  The appeal succeeds and is allowed.  The impugned order dated 10th December, 1992 is hereby quashed  and the  matter is  remitted to the Tribunal for a fresh disposal on the other issue involved in the case on merits  in accordance  with law  and  after  hearing  the parties.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO 2349 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP (C) No.8287 of 2006) 1.      Leave granted. 2.      This appeal is filed against the final order dated 8th of February, 2006 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in second Appeal No. 443 of 2005 by which the High Court had dismissed the second appeal on the ground that reappraisal of evidence was not permitted in deciding the second appeal which was filed at the instance of the appellants. 3.      In our view, this appeal can be disposed of on a very short question. It is an admitted position that during the pendency of the second appeal, an application for acceptance of additional evidence under Order 41, Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed at the instance of the appellants, which, however, was not decided at the time of disposal of the second appeal. In our view, this procedure adopted by the High Court not to dispose of the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code at the time of disposal of the second appeal was not proper. The High Court was required to deal with the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code at the time of disposal of the second appeal. Since the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code was not decided at the time of disposal of the second appeal, it will be difficult for us to agree with the judgment of the High Court passed in the second appeal. In this view of the matter and without going into the merits of the judgment of the High Court passed in the second appeal, we set aside the same and remit the case back to the High Court for decision of the second appeal afresh along with the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code. We request the High Court to decide the second appeal along with the application for acceptance of additional evidence under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code in accordance with law positively within two months from the date of supply of a copy of this order without granting any unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties. 4.      Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents, however, submitted that the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code could not be entertained by the High Court as the appellants had failed to satisfy the conditions laid down in Order 41 Rule 27 of the CPC for acceptance of additional evidence. Since the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code was not at all entertained by the High Court, it would be inappropriate for us to deal with the said application at this stage before a decision is arrived at by the High Court in the second appeal. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 5.      For the foregoing reasons, the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the appeal and the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code are directed to be decided within the time indicated hereinabove.  The appeal thus stands disposed of.  There will be no order as to costs.","This appeal is filed against the final order dated 8th of February, 2006 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in second Appeal No. 443 of 2005.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 6229 of 1983. Appeal by  Special leave  from the  Judgment and  order dated the  29th May,  1980 of  the Punjab  and Haryana  High Court in C.W.P. No. 1225 of 1980. K.G. Bhagat,  Addl. Soliciter  General and  K. K. Mohan for the appellant. R. N. Poddar For the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by: CHINNAPPA REDDY, J. Special leave granted. 655 Smt. P.  Grover was an outstanding teacher. In 1968-69, the Government  of Haryana  honoured her  by presenting  the State  Award   for  teachers.   She  attained   the  age  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 superannuation on  August 2s0,  1978. About two years before she attained  the age of superannuation, she was promoted as acting District  Education Officer with effect from July 19, 1976. The  Government of Haryana had taken a policy decision as early  as in  1965 that the Services of teachers, who had received the  National or  State Awards,  should be extended until they  attained the age of 60 years, on an year by year basis,  if   their  service  record  continued  to  be  good otherwise. Pursuant  to the  policy decision,  Smt. Grover’s services were  extended first  by  one  year  and  later  by another year. During the period of extension of service, she worked as  Principal, Government  Higher  Secondary  School, Mahendergarh. She finally retired from service on August 31, 1980. We  mentioned  that  she  was  promoted  as  an  acting District Education  officer with  effect from July 19, 1976. The order  of promotion  contained a  super-added  condition that she would draw her own pay scale which apparently meant that she  would continue to draw her salary on her pay scale prior to promotion. The initial order extending her services recited that  she was  an acting District Education Officer, but contained a super-added condition that her pay would not be more  than the  maximum of  the Principal’s  grade.  Smt. Grover  claims   that  having   been  promoted  as  District Education officer, she was entitled to the pay of a District Education officer and there was no justification for denying the same  to her. A writ petition filed by her was dismissed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana and she is before us by way  of special leave under Art. 136 of the Constitution. The counter-affidavit  filed on  behalf of the Government of Haryana offers  no rational  explanation for denying the pay of District  Education Officer  to Smt.  P. Grover after she was promoted  to act as District Education officer. All that was said  in the  counter-affidavit was  that there  were no Class-I post  available and  therefore, she was not entitled to be  paid the salary of District Education officer. We are unable to  understand  the  reason  given  in  the  counter- affidavit.  She   was  promoted  to  the  post  of  District Education officer,  a Class-I  post, on an acting basis. Our attention was  not invited  to any  rule which provides that promotion on  an acting  basis would not entitle the officer promoted to  the pay of the post. In the absence of any rule justifying such  refusal to  pay to an officer promoted to a higher post the salary of such higher post (the 656 validity of such a rule would be doubtful if it existed), we must hold that Smt. Grover is entitled to be paid the salary of a  District Education  officer  from  the  date  she  was promoted to  the post,  that is,  July 19,  1976, until  she retired from  service on  August 31,  1980.  The  appeal  is accordingly allowed with costs. H.L.C.                                       Appeal allowed. 657","Smt. P. Grover was an outstanding teacher.

The admitted facts are that Ram Nihore, said to be  liviing,  laid  suit,  impleading  Mansari    as  a  co- plaintiff,  for   perpetual   injunction   restraining   the appellant  from  possession  and  enjoyment  of  the  plaint schedule property.  The  suit  came  to  be  laid  on  April 25,1988. The suit was dismissed for default on May 27, 1988. An application  under Order  9 Rule  4, C.P.C. was filed for restoration on  May 30, 1988. The appellant filed objections stating that  Ram  Nihore  had  already  died  on  September 4,1979. Therefore  it was fraudulent  suit laid on behalf of a dead  person by the co-plaintiff. That application came to be dismissed  on May  30,1988 Subsequently, the co-plaintiff filed an application for substitution of the son of the dead plaintiff on February 6,1990. The appellant raised objection that  since   the  suit   had  already  been  dismissed,  no substitution could  have been  made. Accordingly Civil Court dismissed the application on February 6,1990. The respondent carried the  matter in  revision to  the District Judge. The District Judge  by his  order dated  July 6,l991 allowed the application and  directed substitution.  When it  came to be challenged before  the   High Court  in W.P., the High Court dismissed the same. The question  therefore, is : whether the respondent is entitled to  be substituted  in  a  suit  which  is  already dismissed and  has became final? Though Ms. Sandhya Goswami, learned counsel  for the  respondents sought  time again and again,  for   filing  the   counter-affidavit,  no   counter affidavit has  been filed.

The question  then is : whether the   substitution of  the son  of the dead plaintiff in the suit would  be permissible? It is axiomatic that the  son of the deceased  has no better independent right  than what the original plaintiff himself had. After  filing of the suit on behalf of  a dead  person and  when   the suit  has  already become final  the question  of  substitution does not arise.

Though  the learned  counsel appearing for  the respondents,  Sri Harish  Salve, seeks to contend that  the bank  had granted  loan to  the appellants http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 with a  condition that  the aforestated two persons would be required to continue to work in the company. Therefore it is only a  make-believe show  to  see  that  no  injunction  is granted against the company  and the one granted against the company and  the one   granted by the High Court is vacated. We do  not find   any justification for the contention as on today. If  the two persons really still work for the company in   any  form  and  in  any  manner,  it  is  open  to  the respondents to  approach the  trial  Court  for  appropriate relief. As  facts stand  today, injunction  granted  by  the High Court against the company is not warranted. The appeals are accordingly allowed with the above liberty. The injunction order granted against the company stands dissolve. No costs.","The High Court of Rajasthan had granted an injunction against the company on October 24, 1996 in Revision Petition  No.715/96.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(Civil) No. 2901/2002) K.G. Balakrishnan, J. Leave granted. The claimants in a motor accident claim are appellants before us.  They are the legal heirs of one Rajashekhar Kasture who died in a motor accident. The deceased Rajashekhar Kasture was aged about 24 years at the time of his death.  He was employed as a Munim in Avinash and Co.  On 20.7.1996, when he was travelling in a lorry to bring sugar for his employer, the lorry met with an accident and he fell down and died on the spot. The claimants preferred claim contending that he was the only earning member and was earning Rs. 3000/- p.m.  The respondent No. 2 namely, the lorry owner contended that the deceased was working only as a office boy and was having a salary of Rs. 600/- p.m.  To support his plea, RW1, the owner of the company was also examined.  The Tribunal after considering the evidence on either side held that the salary of the deceased must have been around Rs. 1200/- p.m.  and by deducting 1/3rd for his personal expenses, the monthly dependency of the claimants must have been Rs. 800/- p.m.  Taking the annual income as Rs. 9600/-, the total compensation was fixed at Rs. 1,53,600/- and an award was passed in favour of the claimants.  Aggrieved by the same, the second respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court of Karnataka and the High Court reduced the compensation to Rs. 81,600/- under the heading ’loss of dependancy’. The Judgment of the High Court is challenged before us. We heard learned Counsel on either side.  The High Court considered the evidence of RW1, the partner of the Avinash and Company with whom the deceased was employed.  RW1 deposed that the monthly salary of the deceased was Rs. 600/-.  RW1 had chosen to produce some receipts purportedly signed by the deceased but he cleverly withheld the salary register maintained by the company for the relevant period.  The receipts were not originally produced but later he produced them and the Tribunal rightly declined to take note of the same.  During the time of cross-examination, he admitted that the persons who were similarly employed were being paid Rs. 1,500/- p.m.  It is also difficult to believe that the company would employ a person with such a meagre amount of Rs. 600/- p.m.  It may also be noticed that the company under the management of RW1 was having 4 to 5 lorries and about 30 workers were employed under them.  He must have been keeping some documents in respect of payment of salary to his workers but such documents were not produced.  The Tribunal had considered the evidence in detail and came to a rational conclusion regarding the income of the deceased.  The learned Single Judge without considering the evidence of RW1 simply brushed aside the whole evidence and accepted the statement of RW1 solely on the ground that the employer himself had spoken http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 regarding the salary and it must have been taken as correct.  This approach made by the High Court is not at all justified having regard to the entire facts and circumstances of the case.   The High Court, on flimsy reasons, interfered with the award passed by the Tribunal. The compensation awarded by the Tribunal was just and reasonable. In the result, we allow the appeal preferred by the claimants and set aside the Judgment of the learned Single Judge.  If the appellants have not been paid the amount, the same shall be paid as directed in the award  by the Tribunal within two months.  There will be no order as to costs.","Rajashekhar Kasture was aged about 24 years at the time of his death. He was employed as a Munim in Avinash and Co.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.  Notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act  1 of 1894 for short ‘the   Act’  was published on  August  II, 1971  acquiring about 700 acres of land in  Golabandha  Buxi Palli,  Vikrampur in Ganjam Dist of Orissa State.  By  award dated   October  18,  1976  the  land  Acquisition   Officer determined the market value.  On reference under s. 1 8, the learned  subordinate  Judge  confirmed  the  award  of   the Collector at the rate of Rs.80/- per fruit bearing tree  and Rs.  60/-  per  non-fruit  bearing tree  as  full  value  in addition  to the compensation to the land by his  award  and decree dated August 21, 1986.  The appellants did not  carry the  matter in appeal.  When others filed the  appeal  under s.54   of  the  Act,  the  High  Court  had   enhanced   the compensation to the fruit bearing tree at Rs. 990/- and  Rs. 650/- for non-fruit bearing tree by its judgment and  decree dated  December 12, 1989.  Thereafter, the appellants  filed an  application under s.28-A of the Land Acquisition Act  on May  23  1990  for redetermination.   The  Land  Acquisition Officer  dismissed the application and thereafter  the  High Court by its order dated February 8, 1993 confirmed the same in O.J.C. No.965/92. Thus this appeal by special leave. 3.   It is contended that when the High Court awarded higher compensation by operation of s.28-A of the Land  Acquisition Act  the appellants also are entitled to the  same  benefit. The  point is now squarely covered by two judgments of  this Court  in Scheduled Castes Co-operative Land Own in  Society Ltd., Bhatinda v. Union of India & Ors.reported in AIR  1991 SC 738 and Babua Ram & Ors. v. State of U.P. & 513 Anr.  reported  in  JT  1994 (7)  SC  377.   Therefore,  the appellants  having failed to avail of the remedy  of  appeal and having already availed the remedy of reference under  s. 18,  they  are not entitled to seek redetermination  of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 compensation  on  the  basis  of award  of  the  High  Court granting enhanced compensation.  Section 28-A would apply to the claimants who received the compensation without  protest and  faced  with statutory bar of reference  and  would  not apply  to  those  who  had already  availed  the  remedy  of reference  and got no benefit or lesser benefit  thereunder. Equally  the bar of res judicata clearly would apply to  the appellants.  The application under s.28A is, therefore,  not maintainable.   The  Collector and the  High  Court  rightly refused to grant the amount on par with the judgment of  the High Court. 4.   The appeal is accordingly dismissed.  No costs. 514","A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act  1 of 1894 for short ‘the   Act’ was published on August II, 1971.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R Heard learned counsel for the parties. This appeal is directed against the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala whereby the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has directed the Union of India to grant Swatentrata Samman Sainik Pension (for short ‘SSS Pension\022) to the petitioner (respondent herein) as claimed by him in his Original Petition with effect from 09.09.1989 and the amount should be paid within a period of two months. Aggrieved against this order, the present appeal has been filed by the Union of India. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The Division Bench was hearing an appeal against the order passed by the learned Single Judge whereby the learned Single Judge had given a direction to the Union of India to consider and pass an appropriate order on the petitioner\022s application for grant of SSS Pension to the writ petitioner. The learned Single Judge quashed Exh.P-6 and Exh.P-8 (the orders passed by the Union of India rejecting the petitioner\022s prayer for pension) and remitted the matter back to the Union of India to consider the matter afresh after providing a necessary opportunity to the respondent for considering his prayer for grant of the SSS pension.  Aggrieved by this order, the matter was taken up by the appellant before the Division Bench on which the Division Bench passed the impugned order.  Hence the present appeal by the Union of India. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. We are of the opinion that the course adopted by the learned Single Judge was the correct course and the matter should have been remitted back to the Union of India to decide the question of grant of freedom fighter\022s pension afresh.  It required necessary investigation of facts as to whether the incumbent was entitled to SSS pension or not.  The courts cannot encroach into the executive or legislative domain, and cannot assume the role of investigation of facts.  It is the duty of the State and the Union of India to have considered all the material on the subject and consider whether it is a case worth granting pension as per the SSS Pension Scheme, 1980.  The court has only judicial power to review that executive order on Wednesbury principles, but it cannot arrogate to itself the power of the executive.  If the order passed by the Union of India is not justifiable on Wednesbury principles the court can only set it aside and remit the matter back to the executive for a fresh decision, but the court cannot assume the power of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Union of India.  The court must exercise judicial restraint in such matters. There is broad separation of powers under the Constitution, and one organ of the State should not ordinarily encroach into the domain of another. Montesquieu\022s theory broadly applies in India too. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Division Bench and remit the matter back to the Union of India.  The Union of India shall consider and pass an appropriate order in accordance with law preferably within a period of six months from today. We have been informed that the respondent herein has already expired.  In case it is found that he was entitled to pension then all his arrears should be worked out and shall be given to his legal heirs. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.",The appeal is directed against the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala.

" J U D G M E N T SANTOSH HEGDE,J. Heard learned counsel. Leave granted. A short question arises for our consideration whether the provisions of the Orissa Sales Tax Act (the Act) would in any manner disentitle the appellants from claiming interest which has become payable by virtue of an interim order made by the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The appellants herein had challenged an interim order made by the Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax in a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature, Orissa, Cuttack in OJC No.1200 of 1995. The High Court in the said writ petition made an order on 15.3.1995 in the following terms : ""In the event the petitioner succeeds in the Second Appeal, then the Sales Tax authorities would refund the amount with interest at the rate of 18 per cent per annum. The writ application is disposed of."" Subsequently the appellant succeeded in the proceedings and the amount directed to be deposited by the High Court as per the abovenoted order became liable to be refunded to the appellant. For reasons better known, instead of asking the respondent State to repay the amount deposited by them, the appellant seems to have filed an application under the provisions of the Orissa Sales Tax Act  (the ’Act’) for refund of the amount in deposit. Taking advantage of this procedure followed by the appellant, the respondent State has denied the appellant the benefit of interest granted by the High Court vide its order referred to hereinabove. Aggrieved by the denial of that part of the interest which was due to them under the orders of the High Court, the appellants again approached the High Court in writ petition in OJC No.11998 of 2000 wherein the High Court taking a very narrow view of the matter held that the appellant is entitled only to the interest that was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 permissible under Section 14 of the Act. Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellants are before us in this appeal. It is to be noted that the order of the High Court in earlier writ petition namely OJC No.1200 of 1995 was made by the High Court in the exercise of its power under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India wherein while directing the appellants to deposit the amount quantified therein, the High Court also issued a direction to the respondent State that it should refund the amount with interest at the rate of 18% per annum in the event of the appellants succeeding in the second appeal. This order is definitely not one made under the provisions of the Act. The respondent State which took benefit of the said order and retained the amount deposited by the appellant, cannot now be permitted to say when it comes to refund direction issued by the High Court in its order dated 15.3.1995 will not be binding on it and it is only the provisions of the statute that will bind. As noted above, it is not by invoking the provisions of the Act, the deposit was directed to be made by the High Court, hence, any direction made while making an order under Articles 226 and 227, to deposit any sum of money will be governed by the conditions imposed in the order directing such deposit. On the contrary if any such condition as to the interest had not been made by the High Court while directing the deposit of the amount then it could be said that the refund which may become payable will be governed by the provisions of the State Act. In the instant case, since the very order which directed the deposit itself has directed the refund with 18% interest, we have no doubt in holding the said order as to mean that the refund should be made with interest at the rate of 18% from the date on which the amount was deposited pursuant to the order of the High Court dated 15.3.1995. For the reasons stated above, this appeal succeeds and the same is allowed.","The appellants challenged an interim order made by the Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax in a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature, Orissa, Cuttack in OJC No.1200 of 1995.

" J  U  D  G  M  E  N  T RAJENDRA BABU,  J.  : A fire broke out at Uphaar theatre on the evening of June 30, 1997 in consequence of which a number of persons were either killed or injured.   An Association was formed of victims of Uphaar tragedy.  They filed a writ petition on the ground that the public authorities failed to discharge their statutory obligations and the standard of safeguards set out under the statute and the rules framed thereunder for the purpose of preventing a hazards of breaking out of fire was not observed.   The license and permits to the theatre were issued contrary to the mandatory provisions of the statute and rules.  The petitioners thereafter sought for adequate compensation to the victims in the said tragedy from the respondents for failure to observe the statutory obligations and also on the basis of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The respondents in the writ petition, who are petitioners before us, raised a preliminary objection that the writ petition is not maintainable on various grounds that the extraordinary remedy of a writ petition cannot be used in case of a break out of fire in a theatre which is the result of complex series of causative factors for claiming and awarding damages to hundreds of persons as against the statutory authorities and the company owning the theatre.   It was also detailed that the precise cause of the incident, the role of each of the individual parties and the extent of their blameworthiness, the manner in which the liability has to be apportioned and as to who are entitled to claim the damages and what is the extent of that amount ought to be awarded to each one of them and such questions relate to causation, the extent of culpability, people entitled to claim damages and the amount due to them and all such questions involve complex investigation based on evidence.   Therefore, the writ petition was not an appropriate remedy and could not be maintained. A Division Bench of the High Court considered the various contentions raised in the course of the arguments and wrote an order running to nearly 100 pages and ultimately held that at the preliminary stage the question of maintenance of the petition was being considered and, therefore, it is not deciding the case of merits.  The facts referred to in the course of the order are as stated by the parties and not as found by way of a decision on merits.  The observations and the reference to facts in the course of the order were only of preliminary character.  The High Court held that all the court could say is that it could not be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 concluded that the petition could not be maintained. The learned counsel for the petitioners before us raised an apprehension that the court might adopt some procedure of appointing a Commission to gather certain facts which, by itself, may not be sufficient to dispose of the matter and that  the Commission appointed would only to report whether the rules and regulations were complied therewith or not and no more. Whatever be the apprehensions of the learned counsel they could very well be pointed out to the learned Judges of the High Court who would hear the matter ultimately before the High Court and address their arguments as to the manner in which a dispute of this nature could be resolved satisfactorily. We are sure that when such arguments are addressed before the High Court,  they will be appropriately considered and therefore,  there is absolutely no basis for any apprehension of this nature as entertained by the learned counsel for the petitioners.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court allowing the writ appeal filed by the respondent-Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (in short the \021Corporation\022) and its functionaries. 2.      A writ petition was filed by the appellant claiming that since an award was passed by the Labour Court directing his re-instatement, his pay has to be fixed after taking into consideration the notional increments. Learned Single Judge relied on a Division Bench\022s decision in APSRTC Khammam Region and Anr. v. P. Nageswara Rao (2001 (4) ALD 568 (DB) and allowed the writ petition. 3.      Present respondents filed a writ appeal before the High Court questioning correctness of the judgment. The High Court noticed that the view expressed by the Division Bench in P. Nageswara Rao\022s case (supra)  was dis-approved by this Court in A.P.S.R.T.C. v. S. Narsagoud (2003 (2) SCC 212) and, therefore, allowed the writ appeal directing dismissal of the writ petition. 4.      In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that when an order of re-instatement is passed for all practical purposes there will be continuity in service and, when the re-instatement is done the pay has to be fixed after taking into consideration the notional increments which would have otherwise accrued. 5.      Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand supported the order passed by the High Court. 6.      The principles of law on the point are no more res integra. This Court in S. Narsagoud\022s case (supra) succinctly crystallized principle of law in para 9 of the judgment : \023We find merit in the submission so made. There is a difference between an order of reinstatement accompanied by a simple direction for continuity of service and a direction where reinstatement is accompanied by a specific direction that the employee shall http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 be entitled to all the consequential benefits, which necessarily flow from reinstatement or accompanied by a specific direction that the employee shall be entitled to the benefit of the increments earned during the period of absence. In our opinion, the employee after having been held guilty of unauthorized absence from duty cannot claim the benefit of increments notionally earned during the period of unauthorized absence in the absence of a specific direction in that regard and merely because he has been directed to be reinstated with the benefit of continuity in service.\024 7.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. Admittedly T.  Ramesh Chandra  Chowdhry and  his mother Smt. T.  Venkata Subbamma  had a  compromise in  a suit  for partition between  them. Compromise decree came to be passed on August  28, 1969 by the District Court, Khammam. It would appear that  thereafter  when  Smt.  Venakata  Subbamma  was attempting to alienate the properties given to her under the compromise decree,  the appellants  filed O.S.  No.313/89 in the Court  of the District Munsif at Khammam for a perpetual injunction restraining her from alienating the property. The contest in  the suit  centers  round  the  question  whether Venkata Subbamma got an absolute estate under the compromise decree so  as to  enable her  to alienate  the properties to third parties or she had a limited estate thereunder covered under Section  14(2) of  Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Pending suit, she  died. respondents have come on record under Order 22 Rule  4 CPC claiming that Venkata Subbamma had executed a Will in  her favour.  It was also further contended that she had lost  the original  will and  sought to adduce secondary evidence under  Section 65 of the Evidence Act. The District Munsif  had  refused  to  permit  her  to  adduce  secondary evidence. Thereon  the matter  was carried  in revision. The High Court  of A.P.  in the  impugned order  made in  C.R.P. No.1935/92, dated  November 5,  1993 directed  adduction  of secondary evidence. Thus, this appeal by special leave. The  only   question  is:  whether  the  respondent  is entitled to  adduce secondary  evidence to prove the alleged will said  to have  been executed by Venkata Subbamma in her favour? The  admitted position  is that  in partition  suit. after the Succession Act came into force, namely, August 28, 1969 Venkata  Subbamma had  compromised  with  her  son  and obtained a  decree with covenants contained therein. What is the effect  of that  decree is  the subject  matter  in  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 pending suit.

The  mere  suit  for injunction cannot  be converted into a suit for probation of a will  whereat the  will is to be proved.

That procedure cannot  be converted in a suit for mere injunction as a probate suit and direct the parties to adduce evidence. be it primary or secondary evidence as the circumstances may warrant. The  High Court  has committed  error  of  law  and jurisdiction in directing adduction of secondary evidence in the suit  for injunction  to prove  the will alleged to have been executed by Venkata Subbamma.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated April  15, 1993  of the  Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad made in RP No.5737/87. The appellant was appointed in  1951 as  a Copyist  in  the  Registration  and Stamps Department  in the erstwhile Government of Hyderabad. After formation  of Andhra Pradesh he was allotted to Andhra Pradesh services. By proceedings dated March 16, 1976 he was suspended from service. Though he was initially convicted by the Magistrate,  on appeal in Criminal Appeal No.581 of 1931 the High Court by judgment dated September 1, 1933 set aside the conviction  and acquitted  him of  all  the  charges  on merits. In  the meanwhile,  the appellant was dismissed from service on  July  16,  1981.  Consequently,  he  filed  R.P. NO.840/85. The Tribunal set aside the order and directed the Government to  consider his  case according  to rules. Since the appellant  had not passed the departmental tests, he was not considered  for promotion. He filed writ petition in the High Court in 1986 which directed the Government to consider his case.  He retired on attaining the age of superannuation on December  31, 1984.  Consequently, he  was entitled to be considered for promotion according to rules from the date on which his  immediate junior  was promoted with consequential benefits. It was found that the appellant had not passed the Registration test  and Accounts  test Part  and Part  II for Subordinate Officers  prescribed under  the  Special  Rules. Consequently, he  was not  given promotion.  Again when  the appellant  filed   R.P.  No.5737/87,  the  Tribunal  in  the impugned order  has dismissed the petition. Thus this appeal by special leave. It is  not in  dispute that  the Government have issued orders in  G.O.Ms. No.783 dated September 7, 1971 whereunder the Government  have directed  that first stage promotion be given to all the persons recruited under Hyderabad Cadre and Recruitment  Rules,   without  insisting  upon  passing  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 departmental tests  but gave  double the  time given  to the employees of Andhra Region for passing the tests. The matter was again examined in G.O. Ms. No.818 dated July 21, 1972 in consultation with  the team of Secretaries to the Government of India,  the State  Government reconsidered the matter and decided that  the employees  of the  erstwhile Government of Hyderabad allotted  to  the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  be permanently exempted  from passing the departmental tests on reaching the  age of  45 years for the second and subsequent stages of  promotion after November 1, 1956. The appellant’s date of  birth is October 1, 1928 and he attained the age of 45 years  as on  October 1,  1973.  In  view  of  the  above exemptions under the orders passed by the Government for the first  and   subsequent  promotion  he  is  entitled  to  be considered, without  insisting upon passing the departmental tests, for promotion on par with his immediate junior. Since he had  attained the  age of superannuation as on October 1, 1973,  he  is  entitled  to  be  considered  on  merits  for promotion without  passing  the  Accounts  and  Registration tests. Resultantly,  he was not required to pass any test at any  time   before  he   was  superannuated.   Under   those circumstances, the  view of  the Tribunal  is not correct in law. The order of the Tribunal is, therefore, set aside. The Government is  directed to  consider his  case according  to rules for  promotion without  insisting upon his passing the departmental tests  prescribed under  the Special  Rules  or General Rules and to pass appropriate orders within a period of three  months from  the date of receipt of the order with all consequential benefits. The appeal is allowed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from an order dated April 15, 1993 of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard learned counsel. The appellant  herein, is  Smt. Jaya  Devi. It  appears that her  services as  Assistant Teacher  were terminated by the Directorate  of Education,  Bihar on  February 19, 1990. She moved  the High  Court of  Patna in  Writ Petition being C.W.J.C. No.  1397 of 1990 which was allowed by S.N. Jha, J. sitting singly on November 28, 1991. It was deduced that the government directions  to terminate  services  of  Assistant Teachers were  not  meant  to  apply  to  the  case  of  the appellant. She  was  thus  put  back  to  service.  The  7th respondent herein,  Shri Shyama Kant Jha approached the High Court in  Writ Petition  being C.W.J.C.  No. 13173  of  1993 seeking similar  relief as of the present appellant arraying the appellant  as the  7th respondent  therein, possibly for support of  his case. It came up for hearing before the same learned Single  Judge. The Learned Single Judge thought that he had wrongly granted relief to the appellant. He dismissed the Writ  Petition of  Shri Shyama Kant Jha and withdrew the relief granted  to the appellant by specifically owning that his earlier  order in the case of appellant was not correct. Since the  appellant had  been reinstated  pursuant  to  the orders of  the learned  Single Judge,  he went on to correct the detected  mistake by  ordering that  her appointment  be cancelled as  no further opportunity to her was necessary as she had been heard by him in the matter laid before him. For the period  she had actually worked, the State was precluded by the  learned Single  Judge  from  recovering  salary  and allowances  already   paid  to  her.  This  order  is  under challenge in this appeal. It is  not denied  that a  judicial order  passed by  a court can  be reviewed  or  re-called  by  the  court  after observing the legal procedure as by law devised permitting a review or a re-call. In the instant case, the High Court did not follow  that procedure.  Rather, in  a totally  distinct http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 proceeding where  the appellant  was neither a necessary nor proper party,  where no  relief was claimed against her, she was caught  and deprived  of the  benefit she derived in her Writ Petition. We are not, for the moment, commenting on the merit of  the matter,  but only to the method adopted by the learned Single  Judge in  nullifying his  order in favour of the appellant in proceedings in which she had no interest at all. Mr. B.B. Singh, learned counsel for the State of Bihar, on the  strength of  the two  decisions  of  this  Court  in Chandra Bansi  Singh and  Others etc. vs. State of Bihar and others etc.  [1985 (1) SCR 579 (583)] and State of Rajasthan vs. Gurcharandas  Chadha [1980(1)  SCC 250 ] goes to contend that if  the  High  Court  has  corrected  errors,  even  in exercise of  powers which  it did  not have, then this Court should not  cause any  interference thereto  in exercise  of jurisdiction under  Article 136 of the Constitution. As said before, we are not commenting on the merit of the matter, as to whether  the order  passed by the High Court in favour of the appellant  in the  first instance was correct or not. We have strong reservation in the manner in which the effect of the  order   was  withdrawn  in  distinct  proceedings.  The appellant was  not put  to specific notice that the order in her favour was to be re-called for grounds stated. We cannot uphold such  order of  the High  Court to  the extent  which affects the appellant. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the  impugned order of the High Court to the extent it affects the  appellant.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. This Special  Leave Petition has been filed against the order dated  February 15, 1996 made in O.A. No.978/92 of the CAT, Principal  Bench, New  Delhi. The  admitted position is that  the   petitioner  after  his  promotion  as  Assistant Engineer in  Telecom Engineering  Service Group ’B’ on April 16,  1979   was  kept   under  suspension  and  disciplinary proceedings were  initiated against  him. On  June 30, 1986, punishment was  imposed by way of compulsory retirement. The same came  to be  challenged by way of an appeal. On appeal, the Department  directed  that  the  punishment  be  treated partly as suspension and partly as in service by proceedings dated February  16, 1979. When the petitioner challenged the same in  O.A. No. 1690/90, by order dated February 14, 1992, the same was allowed and direction was given to treat him as on duty for all purposes including pay and allowances. After reinstatement,  the   petitioner  retired  from  service  on attaining superannuation  on May  31, 1992.  He had prior to that filed  representation for  crossing his efficiency bar. In the impugned order, the Tribunal has held that the D.P.C. had considered his case for efficiency bar and found him not fit and,  therefore, he is not entitled to the relief. Thus, this special leave petition. It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the petitioner that  when he  was reinstated  into  service  the efficiency bar  was required  to be  considered after taking into account  his subsequent  record. What  was  stated  was adverse entries  for the  year  1979-80,  1980-81,  1981-82. There was  no reconsideration  in the light of the direction issued by  the Ministry  in the  letter dated  September 18, 1991 in O.M. No. 7(28)/EIII/91 that all pending cases should be considered  to bring  them on  par with  the scale of pay recommended by  the 4th  Pay Commission,  the petitioner had given a representation but the same was not considered; even direction given  to produce  the record  was  not  followed. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Therefore, the  Tribunal ought to have drawn adverse entries and directed  that the  petitioner was entitled to cross the efficiency bar  and he  also  contended  that  sealed  cover procedure as  is  invoked  that  direction  should  also  be considered for  the crossing  of the efficiency bar and kept pending when  the departmental  enquiry was  pending against him. We find  no force in the contention. The petitioner has not brought  to  our  notice  any  circular  issued  by  the Government and  it is  obviously incongruous  for the reason that in  event of  the petitioners  disciplinary proceedings becoming  final,  the  exercise  to  consider  the  question crossing efficacy  bar  would  be  fruitless.  It  would  be unnecessary to  consider the  case for  efficiency  bar.  It would be  only in  the event  of his being reinstated in the service that  the question  of consideration of his crossing efficiency bar  would arise.  Therefore,  the  sealed  cover procedure in  consideration of question of efficacy bar does not apply. It is seen that after the representation was made by the  petitioner on  June 8, 1990, the matter was referred for consideration  by the  D.P.C. D.P.C.  had met on January 21, 1992  and considered the record of the petitioner. After reinstatement, he  had hardly  worked for  three months.  It would appear  that for  three successive  years, there  were adverse entries against the petitioner. Consequently, DPC as considering  the   record  of   the  petitioner   which  was available, recommended that he was unfit to cross efficiency bar. The  same came  to be  informed to  the petitioner vide letter  dated  February  7,  1992.  The  Tribunal  also  had accepted this position. Under these circumstances, we do not find any  illegality in  the order  passed by  the  Tribunal warranting issue of notice. The special leave petition is dismissed.","The Special Leave Petition has been filed against the order dated February 15, 1996 made in O.A. No.978/92 of the CAT, Principal  Bench, New Delhi.

" S.N.  PHUKAN.  J This appeal is  preferred  by  the  Union  of  India through  the  General  Manager, Northern Railway against the Judgment and Order dated 30th January, 1982  passed  by  the Railway Rates Tribunal, Madras. A  complaint was filed under Section 41(l)(c) of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 by the  respondent  regarding  the siding charges levied by the appellant at.  the respondent’s siding  at Saharanpur and fixation of maintenance charges of the siding by the railway.  The tribunal framed as many as 7 issues and after elaborate discusion held  that  the  siding charges  and  maintenance  charges  fixed  by  railway w.e.f 13.03.1980 were unreasonable.  Hence the present appeal. We have heard Ms.  Anjani Aiyangiri, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr.  Pradeep  Misra,  learned  counsel for the respondent. From  the impugned judgment we find that maintenance charges were fixed at Rs.  4838/- for the period 03.10.80 to 31.03.81 and also for subsequent years. At the time of argument it was stated before us that the siding of the respondent was closed  down  in  the  year 1996,   therefore,  these  two  questions  regarding  siding charges and maintenance charges have become academic.    The tribunal  fixed  the  siding charges and maintenance charges not only on the basis of All  ln^ia  cost  incurred  by  the Railway but  on  the  zonal  basis.   The tribunal had given elaborate reasons and had also relied on other decisions  of the tribunal. In  view of the fact that the siding was closed down in  the  year  1996,  both   the   questions   have   become infructuous,  therefore,  we  don’t want to interfere in the present appeal leaving the question regarding the method  of calculation of siding and maintenance charges open.

" O R D E R Mr. A.D.  Sikri, learned  counsel]  accepts  notice  on behalf of the respondents. We have heard the counsel for the parties. Leave granted.

A demand  notice for  Rs.28 lakhs  and odd  having been issued, the  question is:  whether the  Court was  right  in directing ultimately  payment  of  Rs.5,60,000/-?

Normally, in  matters of  money claim,  at least half of the amount would  be directed  to be  deposited In the situation obtaining in  this case,  when the appellant is obligated to supply  electrical  energy  to  the  respondents,  an  equal obligation has  to be  cast on  the respondents  to pay  the amount subject  to determination of controversy in the suit.

" RAJENDRA BABU, J. : L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J A  notification  was issued on February 12,  1977  under Section  1(3)(b)  of  the  Employees  Provident  Funds  and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as  the  Act]  specifying   that  certain   establishments mentioned  in  the Schedule thereto would be covered by  the Act  and,  inter alia, stating that the Act would  apply  to stone  quarries  producing stone chips, stone  set,  stone boulders  and ballasts.  On February 19, 1977 a notification was  issued  under  Section  7(1) of the Act  to  amend  the scheme, namely, the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, 1952 by inserting  identical provisions.  A contention was raised by the appellant in a writ petition filed before the High Court that  no notification has been issued under Section 4 of the Act  including stone quarries in the Schedule to the  Act. In  the absence of a notification issued under Section 4  of the  act, it is contented that the Act has no application to stone  quarry  industry.   However, that writ  petition  was dismissed.   This appeal has been filed by leave granted  by this Court. The  High  Court  took the view that the  appellant  was carrying  on the business of quarrying stone under a  mining lease  and it was carried on by blasting stones at quarry by explosives  which  are thereafter sized either  manually  by chipping or by using a mechanical crusher resulting in stone chips.   The High Court held that the operations carried  on by  the  appellant  are  not  disassociated  activities  but integrally  connected  with  each other and form part  of  a continuous process and the claim of the appellant that it is running  a factory was not accepted.  The High Court noticed that  the  appellant runs the establishment of stone  quarry which  has  been brought within the purview of the Act,  and inasmuch  as  the operation of reducing stones into  smaller size  is subsidiary and incidental operation to the  primary activity,  that  is, running a stone quarry, the High  Court took  the view that it is an establishment which has  been brought within the ambit of the Act by issuing notifications on February 12, 1977 and February 19, 1977. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 On  the facts of the case, admittedly the appellants are lessee  under  the State Government under the provisions  of Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1952 to quarry  and to crush stones.  Therefore, the appellants  are engaged in a manufacturing process as is rightly held by the High  Court.   It  is clear that dominant  activity  of  the appellant  is  to quarry the stones and cut or chip them  to appropriate  size before marketing the same either by manual or  mechanical process which is a subsidiary and  incidental activity  to the primary activity of running a stone quarry.

By the impugned order, the High Court set aside the order passed by the Sessions Judge granting bail to the appellant.  The main reason given by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in cancelling the bail granted to the appellant is that the first bail application was rejected on valid grounds and just 19 days after the rejection of the first bail application, the appellant herein had no ground to urge for bail as there was no change in circumstances.  It was also pointed out that whatever grounds urged in the second bail application could have been stated in the first bail application and the reasons given for grant of bail by the Sessions Judge in the second bail application were in utter violation of the settled principles of judicial propriety.

It is also pointed out that the appellant herein made an attempt on the life of brother of the second respondent herein and for that also a case had been registered against the appellant under Section 307 IPC.   It is further pointed out that a series of crimes have been registered against the appellant. (5)     Shri Ram Jethmalani, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant, pointed out that all these cases have been registered on account of  political rivalry and many of such cases were closed by the investigating agency when they were found baseless.  The list of cases has been furnished by the learned counsel appearing http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for the respondents. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant also pointed out that even against the second respondent several cases are pending and he had no right to move for cancellation of the bail granted to the appellant. (6)     When the matter was pending before us, we repeatedly adjourned the case with the expectation that the important witnesses would be examined by the prosecution and the trial would be completed at an early date.  The trial is being continued and most of the witnesses must have been examined by this time. If the trial is not already over,  the Sessions Judge, Rai Bareli is directed to complete the same within a period of three months and, if for any reason, except the non-cooperation of the accused, the trial is delayed beyond three months, the appellant would be at liberty to move the Sessions Court for bail and, without being influenced by the observations made by the High Court in the impugned order, the same would be considered by the Sessions Judge on merits and appropriate order shall be passed.

Mr. Anip Sachthey, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants before us, submitted, on instructions, that since there is no Receiver of the portion of the suit property in respect of which injunction was granted, possession could not be restored to the said Receiver.  Since, notice by this Court was issued on the simple understanding that the appellants shall restore possession to the Receiver of the portion which was injuncted from being occupied, we are of the view that the order must be complied with.      Mr, Sachthey, learned counsel appearing for the appellants, submits that if a Receiver is appointed, immediately the possession shall be delivered to him. 4.      Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the nature of order passed by this Court, we appoint Smt. Gulab Bai, widow of     Sh. Kamal Chand, as Receiver to comply with the order of this Court and possession of the suit property which was injuncted from being occupied and vacated by the Punjab National Bank shall now be restored to her  within four weeks from this date.  If the possession is delivered to the Receiver appointed by this Court, the order of attachment passed by this Court on 14th of December, 2006 shall stand released.  We, however, request the trial court, where the suit is now pending, to dispose of the suit within one year from the date of supply of a copy of this order. 5.      The appeal is thus disposed of.

" CRIMINAL APPELLANTE JURLSDICTION: Case No. 349 of 1951. Appeal  under article 132 (1) of the Constitution  of  India from  the Judgment and Order dated the 26th June,  1951,  of the  High  Court of Judicature,at Bombay (Chagla C.  J.  and Gajendragadkar J.) in Criminal Application No. 345 of 1951. A.A.  Peerbhoy,  Jindra  Lal  and  I.  N.  Shroff  for   the appellant. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General for India (Porus A. Mehta, with them) for respondent No. 1. 931 J.B. Dadachanji and Rajinder Narain for respondent No. 2. 1954.  March 10.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.-The question in this case is whether section 497  of the Indian Penal Code contravenes articles 14 and 15 of  the Constitution. The appellant is being prosecuted for adultery under section 497 of the Indian Penal Code.  As soon as the complaint  was filed  he applied to the High Court of Bombay  to  determine the  constitutional question mentioned above  under  article 228 of the Constitution.  The High Court decided against him but granted him a certificate under articles 132 (1) and 134 (1) (c). Under  section  497  the offence of  adultery  can  only  be committed  by a man  but in the absence of any provision  to the  contrary the woman would be punishable as  an  abettor. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The last sentence in section 497 prohibits this.  It runs- ""In  such  case  the  wife shall not  be  punishable  as  an abettor."" It is said that this offends articles 14 and 15. The  portion of article 15 on which the appellant relies  is this: ""The  State  shall not discriminate against any  citizen  on grounds only of............... sex."" But what he overlooks is that is subject to clause (3) which runs ""Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women.......... "" The provision complained of is a special provision and it is made for women, therefore it is saved by clause (3). It  was  argued  that  clause  (3)  should  be  confined  to provisions which are beneficial to women and cannot be  used to  give them a licence to commit and abet crimes.   We  are unable  to read any such restriction into the clause  ;  nor are we able to agree that a 932 provision  which  prohibits punishment is tantamount  ,to  a licence  to commit the offence of which punishment has  been prohibited. Article  14  is  general and must be  read  with  the  other provisions  which set out the ambit of  fundamental  rights. Sex  is a sound classification and although there can be  no discriminate   in general on that ground,  the  Constitution itself provides for special provisions in the case of  women and  children.  The two articles read together validate  the impugned clause in section 497 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellant is not a citizen of India.  It was argued that he could not invoke articles 14 and 15 for that reason.  The High  Court held otherwise.  It is not necessary for  us  to decide  this question in view of our decision on  the  other issue. The appeal is dismissed. Appeal dismissed. Agent for respondent No.1 :  R. H. Dhebar. 933",The question in this case is whether section 497 of the Indian Penal Code contravenes articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. The appellant is not a citizen of India.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 8108-8109 OF 2001 These appeals are preferred by the plaintiff against the judgment and order dated 8.3.2001 passed by the High Court of Karnataka in R.F.A.No.73 of 1993 and C.P. No. 683 of 1999. The facts of this case illustrate a disquieting feature as to how the power under Order LXVII Rule 1 is being misused. The plaintiffs filed a suit in 1981 for declaration of possession.  The suit was decreed by the trial court on 25.9.1992.  Aggrieved thereby the defendants filed appeal before the High Court which was dismissed on merits after recording a finding by the same Judge on 7.4.1999.  Plaintiffs’ Execution Petition was allowed by the Executing Court and warrant of delivery of possession was issued.  After the warrant of delivery of possession was issued it appears that the defendants filed a review application under Order LXVII Rule 1 sometime in August, 1999 and by the impugned order the High Court has allowed, not only the review application but allowed the appeal which was already dismissed by the Court on 7.4.1999. Order LXVII Rule 1 entitles a party who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, to apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order. Power of review, therefore, is limited and confined subject to the aforesaid conditions. In the present case the learned Judge which dismissed the appeal of the defendants on merits on 7.4.1999 allowed the review application by appreciating the entire evidence on record as if the Judge was sitting as an appellate court, which is not permissible under the law.  While disposing of the appeal the learned Judge also recorded that the land in question was throughout in the possession of the plaintiffs.  However, in review application the same finding has been reversed which is not permissible in the review application. Suffice it to say that in the regular appeal the learned Judge has clearly recorded the admission of the defendants that the land alloted to the defendants was in Survey No. 10/4.  Having recorded the finding at the admission of the defendants, sitting in a review, the learned Judge has also alloted the Survey No. 10/17, the same land which was alloted and was in the ownership of the plaintiffs.  The learned Judge, in our view, committed a grave miscarriage of justice. In the result, the appeals are allowed.  The judgment and order of the High Court under challenge is set aside.  There will be no order as to costs.",The plaintiffs filed a suit in 1981 for declaration of possession. The suit was decreed by the trial court on 25.9.1992.

In the written statement filed on behalf of the appellants, it was asserted that the aforesaid petition filed by the Custodian was barred by limitation and fit to be dismissed.

" THE 27TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Hon’ble Mr. Justice V.N. Khare R.S. Sodhi, Kuldip Singh, Advs. for the appellant Sudhir  Walia,   Adv.  for   Prem  Malhotra,  Adv.  for  the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: Nanavati. J. The State is challenging acquittal of the respondent in this appeal. The respondent  was tried  for the  murder of Kulwinder Singh and  the trial  court relying  upon  the  evidence  of Kulwinder Kaur  - PW  5 and  Gian Singh  - PW 4 which proved that the  accused and  the deceased  were last seen together and t  he evidence  of recovery  of currency notes and wrist watch of the deceased, on the basis of a declaration made by the accused,  held him  guilty. The  appellant was convicted for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. The High  Court held that Gian Singh was chance witness and therefore it was risky to rely upon his evidence without any corroboration.  The High Court also held that idently of currency notes  and the  wrist watch  was not established by the proesecution  beyond doubt  and  therefore  it  was  not possible to say that they belonged to the deceased. The High Court, therefore, acquitted the respondent. After going  through the  evidence what we find is that the recovery  of money  and the  wrist watch stated to be of the deceased  were recovered by the Investigating officer in presence of  Amar Singh  - PW 10 - Maternal grandfather of t he deceased.  Thus, the  recovery was not in presence of any independent person.  It was  for this  reason that  the High Court did  not think  it safe  to place  any reliance on the recovery evidence.  The evidence  of PW  5 -  Kulwinder Kaur even if  believed only  establishes that the accused and the deceased left  together at  5.00 p.m.  on 18.2.85. From that circumstance alone  no  inference  can  be  drawn  that  the respondent had committed the murder of Kulwinder Singh. We therefore  see no  good reason to interfere with the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 acquittal order  passed by  the High  Court. The  appeal is, therefore, dismissed.",High Court held that Gian Singh was chance witness and therefore it was risky to rely upon his evidence without any corroboration.

He was admitted to an hospital and underwent surgery twice for his fractured leg which required insertion of a rod. He was in the hospital for more than eight months. 3        He filed a claim petition before the Motors Accident Claims Tribunal claiming compensation of Rs.3,00,000/-. The Tribunal awarded Rs.48,000/- towards medical expenses and Rs.25,000/- towards future medical expenses. -2- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 4 In regard to loss of future earnings, it found the disability to be 30%.        The Tribunal assessed the annual income of appellant as Rs.36,000/-; and as the appellant had suffered 30% disability, it calculated the future loss of earning with reference to a multiplier of 16, that is 30% of 36000 X 16=172800/- (rounded off to Rs.1,72,000/-). Thus, it awarded Rs.2,45,000/- in all as compensation. 4   On appeal by the first respondent, the High court reduced the compensation to Rs.99,000/-. The High court was of the view that the Tribunal ought not to have taken the permanent disability as 30% as the disability could not be said to be permanent as there was likelihood of improvement.             It therefore, deleted the award of Rs.1,72,000/- towards loss of future earning capacity. It however added Rs.11,000/- as loss of income for nine months (period of treatment) and Rs.15000/- towards paid and suffering to arrive at Rs.99,000/- as compensation. The said judgment is challenged by the claimant. 5        We find that the High Court has misread the disability certificate. The certificate dated 23.2.2004 showed that disability as 30%. There is no acceptable medical evidence to show that the condition of appellant will improve or that the permanent disability will disappear. -3- 4       Having regard to the said position, we are of the view that the High Court should not have interfered with the quantum of compensation. We are of the view that the total compensation of Rs.2,45,000/- awarded by the Tribunal was just compensation. Accordingly, we allow these appeals and set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the Award of the Tribunal. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 4 ...................C.J.I.

" ORDER 1.   Special leave granted. 2.   We  have  heard learned counsel for the  appellants  as well as the State of Madhya Pradesh.  We have also before us the learned counsel for the original complainant.  The trial court  had  acquitted  the appellants  but  the  High  Court convicted  them under Section 307 IPC and sentenced them  to rigorous imprisonment for three years.  The learned  counsel for  the  appellants rightly pointed out that  all  the  six incised wounds were not more than 1/2 inch in size and  were skin  deep and, therefore, the High Court was not  right  in attributing  an  intention to cause death.  The  High  Court came to the conclusion that having regard to the fact that a sharp cutting instrument was used and certain injuries  were caused  on  the chest portion of the complainant-PW  2,  the intention of the assailant was clearly to commit murder and, therefore, the offence fell within the ambit of Section  307 IPC.   We are afraid we cannot accept this approach  of  the High  Court.   The circumstances under  which  the  incident occurred do not permit such an inference.  The quarrel  took place suddenly.  The complainant too had a criminal history. When  the complainant objected to the language used  by  the appellants  the  latter  reacted  and  these  injuries  were caused.  There was no motive whatsoever.  There could be  no intention  to kill.  In order to bring the case  within  the ambit of Section 307 IPC, it must be shown that the  accused acted  with  such  intention or  knowledge  and  under  such circumstances that if he by that act caused death, he  would be  guilty  of murder.  To justify a conviction  under  this provision  an  intention or knowledge to  constitute  murder must exist, it is a different matter that the act fell short of that offence.  The injuries caused are only skin deep and having  regard to the size of the injuries it would  not  be permissible to infer that the assault was launched with such intent.  Besides there is no evidence to show that any X-Ray was  taken,  though  advised, and, if yes,  that  the  X-Ray http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 revealed any serious injury.  Taking an overall view of  the matter, we are of the opinion that at best even if we accept the  evidence of prosecution witnesses viz., PWs 2, 4 and  5 as  has  been done by the High Court, the  case  would  fall within the scope of Section 324 IPC.  Since the parties  who are  neighbours  have  expressed a desire  to  compound  the matter and since the learned counsel for the complainant who is  present  before us has also stated that her  client  has desired  that  permission  to compound  the  matter  may  be granted  to  ensure lasting peace, we see no  difficulty  in granting  the  permission  to the parties  to  compound  the matter.  An affidavit in that behalf has already been  filed and the same is on record.  We accept the same and treat the matter  as compounded.  In view thereof the  conviction  and sentence  are  set  aside  and  the  appellants  will  stand acquitted  as  the  matter  has  been  compounded  with  the permission of the Court.

The admitted  position is  that the petitioner, who are working as  fitter (T  & G),  had sought  to be fused in the category of, and to be  on par with, Jig Borers. They sought equal pay  on par  with them.  They contend  that they  were drawing  higher  pay-scales  than  the  Fitter;  instead  of elevating their  cadre and  placing them  in the higher pay- scales, they  have been brought them down in the category as a Fitter  after removing  the two nomenclatures. Thereby, it is arbitrary  on account  of invidious  discrimination.  The Third Pay Commission had gone into that aspect of the matter and fixed  the scales of pay. Thereafter, admittedly, Expert Classification Committee and Anomalies Removal Committee had also gone into the matter and made distinction between them. Subsequently, nomenclature  of all  of them were removed and fused into  one category,  namely, Fitter.  Nomenclature and fitment is one of executive policy of the Government. Unless the action is arbitrary or there is invidious discrimination between persons similarly situated, doing same type of work, as is pointed out, it would be difficult for the Court to go into the  question of  equation of  posts or  fitment into a particular scale  of pay. They must be left to be decided by the Expert  Committees and  evaluate the  job  criteria  and scales of  pay prescribed  for each  category.  Under  those circumstances, the  Tribunal is  justified in refusing to go into the question. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner sought equal pay on par with Jig Borers.

" J U D G M E N T 2 2336-2337 2003 SANTOSH HEGDE,J. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. By the impugned judgment the High Court while entertaining a criminal appeal against an order of conviction recorded by the Special Court against the respondents herein for an offence under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, (the Act) not only stayed the sentence imposed by the trial court but also proceeded to stay the conviction which could facilitate the respondent public servant to continue to hold the civil post in spite of the conviction recorded against him. While doing so the High Court rejected the objection of the State as also distinguished the judgment of this Court in K.C. Sareen v. CBI, Chandigarh (2001 (6) SCC 584) on facts. Having perused the impugned order as also the judgment of this Court in K.C. Sareen (supra), we find the High Court had no room for distinguishing  the law laid down by this Court in K.C. Sareen’s case (supra) even on facts. This Court in the said case held : ""The legal position, therefore, is this: though the power to suspend an order of conviction, apart from the order of sentence, is not alien to Section 389(1) of the Code, its exercise should be limited to very exceptional cases. Merely because the convicted person files an appeal in challenge of the conviction the court should not suspend the operation of the order of conviction. The court has a duty to look at all aspects including the ramifications of keeping such conviction in abeyance. It is in the light of the above legal position that we have to examine the question as to what should be the position when a public servant is convicted of an offence under the PC Act. No doubt when the appellate court admits the appeal filed in challenge of the conviction and sentence for the offence under the PC Act, the superior court should normally suspend the sentence of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 imprisonment until disposal of the appeal, because refusal thereof would render the very appeal otiose unless such appeal could be heard soon after the filing of the appeal. But suspension of conviction of the offence under the PC Act, dehors the sentence of imprisonment as a sequel thereto, is a different matter."" (emphasis supplied) In the said judgment of K.C. Sareen (supra), this Court has held that it is only in very exceptional cases that the court should exercise such power of stay in matters arising out of the Act. The High Court has in the impugned order nowhere pointed out what is the exceptional fact which in its opinion required it to stay the conviction. The High Court also failed to note the direction of this Court that it has a duty to look at all aspects including ramification of keeping such conviction in abeyance. The High Court, in our opinion, has not taken into consideration any of the above factors while staying the conviction. It should also be noted that the view expressed by this Court in K.C. Sareen’s case (supra) was subsequently approved followed by the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Atar Singh & Anr. [JT 2001 (10) SC 212].

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and examined the record. The  appellant  had  raised  a  specific  plea  in  the executing  court  regarding  the  non-attachability  of  his residential house  in view  of the  provisions of Section 60 (CCC) C.P.C.  The executing  court has  not dealt  with  the issue and  the High  Court, also  did  not  deal  with  that question and  dismissed the  civil revision  petition by one word ""dismissed"".  In our  opinion, since  the parties  were present before  the High Court in the civil revision, on the plainest consideration  of justice,  it should have assigned reasons for  dismissing the  civil revision petition against the order of the executing court. The absence of reasons has deprived this  court to know the circumstances which weighed with the  High Court  to dismiss  the revision  petition  in limine.  We   say  it   with  respect,   that  it   was   an unsatisfactory method  of disposal of the revision petition.

Aggrieved against the said decision, the Bank straightway filed the above special leave petition in this Court.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court made in  Criminal   Appeal  No.1394  on  October  15,  1986.  The Magistrate has  acquitted the appellant of the charges under Sections 420  and 409  IPC and  other offences but on appeal the High  Court convicted the appellant for an offence under Section 409  IPC and  sentenced him  to undergo imprisonment till the  rising of  the Court,  and a  fine of Rs.500/-. In default of  the payment  of the  fine, he  was  directed  to undergo six months’ rigorous imprisonment. Since the learned counsel for  the appellant had raised a question whether the deficiency is  within 5% of the total quantity and since the Court had not gone into that question, we directed the State to produce the entire record. Pursuant thereto, the evidence has been  made part  of the  record and  we  have  carefully scanned the evidence. The charge  against the appellant is that he was posted as Manager  of Kisan  Rice Mills,  Sarngarth between January 29, 1968  to October 30, 1973. During the said period, while he was in custody and management of the huge stocks of paddy entrusted to him, it was found that 1,500 quintals paddy was unaccounted for.  Consequently, the charge came to be framed against him  in the  Court of  the Chief Judicial Magistrate for  the   aforesaid  offences.   As  stated   earlier,  the Magistrate acquitted  him of  the charges but the High Court convicted him  for the offences under Section 409 IPC. After elaborate consideration  of the evidence, the High Court has recorded as under: ""In  our   opinion   the   evidence discussed above clearly establishes that 1,500 qtls. of paddy was found short  in   the  stock   which  was verified in  the  presence  of  the accused. It is true that only 5% of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 bags were  weighed out of the total quantity  present.  That,  however, has been  the matter  employed  and the  accused   never   raised   any objection to  it. In  any case, the accused has  admitted the  shortage vide Ex.P-13  and  his  explanation have been  that it  was due  to the fact  of   the  paddy  drying.  The documents  proved   and  the   oral evidence discloses that he had made false entries  and showed  a  false transfer of  this quantity of paddy to  Baramkela   society.   In   our opinion, the  evidence  establishes beyond doubt  that the  accused had misappropriated  1500  quintals  of paddy entrusted to him."" This finding  of the High Court gets amply support from the evidence  of the  witnesses. We are totally in agreement with the  said  finding.  The  witnesses  are  disinterested official witnesses.  They have  no axe  to grind against the appellant. PW-1 has explained that he had physically got the stock verified  every year and noted the deficiency. He also stated that  it was  done in  the presence of the appellant- accused. PW-2  also has  spoken with reference to the record of the  maintenance and  he was  in custody  of  the  record thereof. Under  these circumstances,  the  evidence  clearly establishes that  the appellant  has failed  to account  for 1,500 quintals  of paddy  entrusted to  him. Therefore,  the conviction of  the  appellant  under  Section  409  is  well justified. Though  we find  that the sentence imposed by the High Court  was inadequate  but at this distance of time, it will not be necessary to give any notice for the enhancement of the sentence. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court made in Criminal   Appeal  No.1394 on October 15, 1986.

The said vehicle was found to be defective. According to the complainant in place  of new engine an old engine was fitted and thereupon old engine No. embossed. It was further stated that gear box and clutch plates of the vehicle were not from the original company and it got slipped once the vehicle ran. We have been taken through the complaint petition.

Strangely enough all the accused persons named in the complaint petition are stated to be Managing Directors of Bhopal Motors Ltd, Sanghi Brothers and M/s Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI, J. The appellant  was convicted under Section 302 IPC, for causing death  of Kandamuthan on 25.5.89 at about 9.30 p.m., by the  court of  Session Pallakad, in Sessions Case No. 110 of 1989. His appeal (Cr1. A.NO. 458/90) to the High Court of Kerala was dismissed. Though the  assault was seen by four witnesses, only PW 1 supported  the prosecution.  Believing his  evidence,  the trial court convicted the appellant. The High Court has also believed his  evidence. The  High Court  also held  that the evidence of PW 1 received support from the circumstance that the appellant  had surrendered before the police on the next day at  Kollengoda  Police  Station  with  a  blood  stained chopper on  which subsequently human blood was found and the hairs found on it were also reported by the Forensic Science Laboratory to be the same as those of the deceased. We have  gone through  the evidence  of PW  1 - Nagmani with whom the deceased was till one minute before his death. The deceased  had come  to the  house of PW 1 heard sound of falling  of   a  cycle.  He,  therefore,  looked  into  that direction and saw that the appellant was giving blows to his friend with  a sword.  He immediately  rushed to  that place which was about 30 feet away from the gate of his house. The appellant ran  away from  that place.  PW 1  then lifted the deceased and  brought him  near his  gate. The  deceased had also told him that it was the appellant who had deceived him indicating thereby that the appellant had caused injuries to him. Both  the courts have believed the evidence of PW 1. We see no  reason to  differ from the findings recorded in this behalf by both the courts below. It  was  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant that  there was  no light  where the  incident had taken place  and therefore  PW 1  could not  have  seen  the incident or  in any  case he  could not  have recognised the assailant. This  submission cannot  be accepted because PW 1 has clearly  stated that  street lights were on at that time and he  could see the incident in that light. Merely because the witnesses  have stated  that after  he had  brought  the deceased near  the gate  of his  house and brought a lamp he http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was able  to see all the wounds of the deceased, that cannot lead  to  an  inference  that  he  had  not  identified  the assailant. The circumstance that the appellant had presented himself with  MOI chopper stained with blood which was found to be human blood corroborates the evidence of PW 1. We are  therefore of  the view  that the High Court was right in  accepting the  evidence of PW 1 and convicting the appellant for  the murder  of kandamuthan.  As  we  find  no substance in this appeal, it is dismissed.","The appellant was convicted under Section 302 IPC, for causing death of Kandamuthan on 25.5.89 at about 9.30 p.m., by the court of Session Pallakad, in Sessions Case No. 110 of 1989.

The writ petition filed by the  appellants in  the Delhi High Court has been dismissed only by  stating as under: ""The petition is misconceived.

The petitioner  had applied  for grant  of  a lease of land from owners thereof, respondents 4-7 on August 22, 1991  for a period of 15 years to win over black granite over an extent of 12.08 acres of land in S.Nos. 105/1, 2, 3, of R.I. Puram village, Chimakkurthy Manal, Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh. The Director granted the mining lease for six months  on August 11, 1994, pending further proceedings. Aggrieved thereby, the respondent-owners filed Writ Petition No. 15615/94  challenging the  grant of  lease without their consent. The writ petition was disposed of on 7.10.1994 with a direction  that the  lease  could  be  granted  only  with consent of the respondent-owners. However, without obtaining their consent,  lease was executed on January 5, 1995 for 15 years. Notice  was issued  by  the  respondent-landlords  on January 5, 1996 requesting the petitioner-lessee to handover the land  by July  7, 1996  after the  expiry of the initial lease. Thereafter  there was exchange of the notice etc. and the petitioner  filed a  writ petition  and the  High  Court directed the  authorities to  extend to  period of  lease in terms of  the lease  granted by  the Industries  and  Mining Department.  W.P.  No.  13147/96  was  disposed  of  with  a direction to the Industries to dispose of the application in accordance with  the Rules  applicable to  them within eight weeks. The  order dismissing  the writ  petition came  to be passed on  July 10,  1996. The Director granted mining lease again on  August 28,  1996. Writ  Petition No.  13147/96 was dismissed on  the ground  of res judicata. Writ petition No. 19865/96 filed  by the  petitioner  to  grant  mining  lease without reference  to  the  consent  of  the  landlords  was dismissed on 19.9.1996. Writ appeal No. 1191/96 was filed by the petitioner  against the  order dated  23.8.1996 in  Writ Petition No.  13147/96. Both  came to  be dismissed  by  the Division Bench. Thus, this special leave petition. The primary contention raised before us by Shri Soli J. Sorabjee, learned  senior counsel,  is  that  there  was  an earlier judgment  of the High Court wherein it was held that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 there was  no need  to obtain  the consent  of the landlords before grant  of mining  lease and, therefore, the direction issued by the Division Bench of the ground of the prevailing practice is not correct in law. We find  no force  in  the  contention.  The  right  to excavate the mines from the land of private owner is based o the agreement;  unless the  lessor  gives  his  consent,  no lessee has  a right  to enter  upon his  land and  carry  on mining  operation.  The  right  to  grant  mining  lease  to excavate the  mines beneath  the surface  is subject  to the agreement of  the land  owners, Therefore,  with a  view  to ensure that  there will not be any obstruction in working of the mining  lease and also for the peaceful operation to the excavation of  the mines,  insistence on  the consent of the landlord is  necessary.  Therefore,  we  do  into  find  any illegality in  the view  taken by  the High Court warranting interference. The special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.","The petitioner had applied for grant of a lease of land from owners thereof, respondents 4-7 on August 22, 1991 for a period of 15 years to win over black granite over an extent of 12.08 acres.

" O R D E R The petitioners  were appointed as Field Workers in the Filaria Department  of the State Government between 1981 and 1985. In  the first  instance, they had fixed W.P. No.250/92 and the High Court directed the Government to consider their representation and  dispose it  of by judgment dated January 18, 1993.  When they came to this Court, this Court directed the Government  to consider  their cases in the Right of the law laid  down by  this Court  in State of Haryana Vs. Piara Singh [(1932) 4 SCC 118]. Subsequently, since the Government had not  taken any steps, the petitioners fixed another writ petition. In  the meanwhile,  the Public  Service Commission [PSC]  had  selected  the  candidates  who  were  not  being appointed. Therefore,  the  selectees  approached  the  High Court and  filed the  writ petition.  The  petitioners  also filed the  writ petition  in  the  High  Court  seeking  for regularisation. The  High Court  in the impugned order dated June 24,  1996 in  O.P. No.  17422/93 dismissed the batch of writ petitions  filed by  the petitioners  allowed one  writ petitions filed by the selectees and directed the Government to appoint  the candidates selected through the PSC. It also directed the  Government to  send the requisition to the PSC to fill  up the  posts of  30 vacancies from the list of the selected candidates  prepared by  the PSC. Thus this special leave petition. It is  bought to  be contended  by Mr.  M.M.  Paikedav, learned senior counsel for the petitioners that in the light of the law laid down by this Court in Piara Singh’s case and in  view   of  the  fact  that  the  petitioners  have  been continuing for  more than  14 years, they are required to be regularised. We find no force in the contention. Admittedly, the posts  are to  be filled  up through  selection  by  PSC recruitment norms.  Necessarily, therefore,  the requisition was sent  for selection  through the PSC and candidates came to be  selected. Under  those circumstances, the candidates, who were  found eligible  and selected  and recommended  for appointment by  the PSC,  were required to be appointed. The http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court rightly  had  exercised  the  power  in  declining  to regularise the services of the petitioners. The learned counsel sought to rely upon an order of the Government where  the Government  had decided  to regularise the services of the employees. Obviously, since the decision runs into  the teeth  of statutory requirement under Article 320 of  the Constitution  the  Government  cannot  take  any decision contrary  to the  Constitution  to  regularise  the services of the candidates de hors the recruitment rules and the statutory  process for  selection through  the PSC.  The High Court,  therefore, has  rightly given  direction to the Government to notify 30 vacancies and odd or whatever may be the  vacancies   existing  to   fill  up  from  amongst  the candidates selected by the PSC. It is  then contended  that the petitioners have turned over-aged and,  therefore, necessary  direction may be given to regularise  their service  by  filling  up  the  unfilled posts. Even  that relief  also cannot  be  granted.  If  the petitioners  have   turned  over-aged   on   the   date   of recruitment, it  would be  for the appropriate Government to relax the  age requirement and the petitioners have to stand in the  queue and  get selection  through the PSC. Thus that they get in only the right to appointment to the post.

" THE 29TH DAY OF APRIL, 1998 Present: Hon ’ble Mr. Justice G.T.Nanavati Hon ’ble Mr. Justice S.P.Kurdukar Mr .  Naresh Kaushik  and Ms.  Lalita Kaushik, Advocates for the appellant. Mr. Ashok Kumar Sharma and Mr.M. Veerappa, Advocates for the respondents. J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI. J The appellant  was convicted by the trial court for the offence punishable  under Section  326 IPC  and sentenced to suffer imprisonment  for one  month and to pay a fine of Rs. 1000/-. Not  satisfied with  the conviction and sentence the appellant filed an appeal along with other convicted accused to the  High Court.  State had also filed appeal against the acquittal of all the accused and for enhancement of sentence of appellant.  The High Court confirmed the conviction under Section 326  and enhanced the sentence from one month to one year. The  appellant has, therefore, approached this Court a challenging the order of sentence and also his conviction. What has  been proved  against the appellant is that he caused an  injury with  an axe   on the head of  P.W. 5. The evidence of  P.W. 5 has been believed by both the courts and it also stands corroborated by the medical evidence. We find on good  reason not  to accept  the finding  recorded by the courts below  confirm the  conviction of the appellant under Section 326  IPC. The  nature of  the injury  indicates that blow must  have been  given by  A.1 with  great force on the forehead of  P.W. 5  as it had caused a fracture. Therefore, the conviction  to the  appellant under Section 326 is quite proper. Considering the nature of injury caused to P.W. 5 we do not  think that  the sentence  imposed upon the appellant can be said to be excessive. The  learned   counsel  for   the  appellant,  however, submitted that  even if  it is  believed that A.1 had caused grievous hurt  he could  not have  been held  guilty  either under Section  326 or  for any  other offence  as  the  said injury was  caused by  him in  excise of  right  of  private http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 defence. Both  the courts  have come  to the conclusion that the accused  and his companions were the aggressors and that too because  they protested  against the accused cutting the tree. Therefore,  there was  no scope for giving any benefit of right of private defence to the appellant. We, therefore, 300 no reason to interfere with the order passed by the High Court. The  appeals are, therefore, dismissed. The appellant was released on bail during the pendency of the appeals. His bail is  cancelled. He  is ordered  to surrender  to custody forthwith to serve out the remaining part of the sentence.",The appellant was convicted by the trial court for the offence punishable under Section  326 IPC. He was sentenced to suffer imprisonment for one month and to pay a fine of Rs. 1000. Not satisfied with the conviction and sentence the appellant filed an appeal along with other convicted accused to the High Court. The High Court confirmed the conviction under Section 326  and enhanced the sentence from one month to one year.,appointment,37.08

The factual details need not detain us as undisputedly the co-accused have been acquitted by this Court in Mousam Singha Roy and Others v. State of W.B. [2003(12) SCC 377]. The effect of such acquittal vis-‘-vis similarly situated co- accused has been considered by this Court in several cases. 3.      Learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on various decisions of this Court contending that the benefit of acquittal should be extended to the appellant. 4.      Learned counsel for the State on the other hand submitted that the appellant did not surrender initially and therefore decisions relied upon may not have any relevance. He relied on the decisions in Raja Ram & Ors. v. State of M.P. (1994 (2) SCC 568); Kashmira Singh v. State of Punjab (1995 (Supp) 4 SCC 558);  Dandu Lakshmi Reddy v. State of A.P.

The appellant subsequently surrendered and has suffered custody for more than two years. 5.      The position in law as to what happens in case of acquittal of similarly placed co-accused on the same set of facts and on similar accusations has been considered by this Court in several cases. 6.      A departure may be made in cases where the accused had not surrendered after the conviction in addition to not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 filing an appeal against the conviction.

Niren De and Altaf Ahmed for the Petitioner. Hardyal Hardy and R. P. Sharma for the Respondents. ORDER Delay  condoned and special leave granted on a point  raised by the, appellant under the proviso to the Explanation to s. 1  1 (1) (h) of the Jammu and Kashmir Houses and Shops  Rent Control Act, 1966 (for short, the Act). The only ground which we consider tenable and which has been urged  by the appellant before us turns on the,  failure  of the courts of 381 fact  in recording a finding as contemplated in the  proviso to  the Explanation to s. II (1) (h) of the Act.   Obviously an error has been com-mitted by the, High Court in  thinking that there is a concurrent finding of fact under the proviso aforesaid.   The trial court and the first  appellate  court have  really  not considered this question  on  the  merits; indeed evidence itself has not been taken on the score  that there  has  been no specific plea in that  behalf.   We  are satisfied that the proviso aforesaid mandates the, court  to consider whether partial eviction as contemplated the should be  ordered or the entire holding should be directed  to  be evicted.    This   aspect,  therefore,   required   judicial exploration  after giving opportunity to both sides to  lead evidence) in this behalf. We direct the first appellate court to go into the  question as to whether the reasonable requirement of the landlord may be  substantially ,satisfied by evicting the tenant  from  a part  only of the premises as contemplated in  the  proviso. If  after  taking evidence the court is satisfied  that  the entire  house  or premises must be vacated  to.  fulfil  the reasonable  requirement of the landlord, the  present  order will  stand.  If, on the other hand the court  finds,  as  a fact, that partial eviction will meet the ends of justice as visualised  in  the proviso, an appropriate  order  will  be passed on that footing.  The court will take up the case  on file pursuant to this order of remand and confine itself  to this  limited  issue,  give  opportunity  to  both  to  lead evidence on this sole question and dispose of the appeal  in accordance  with  law  within two months.   The  court  must proceed  on  the  footing that the  absence  of  a  specific pleading under the said proviso does not stand in the way of the  obligation of the court to act in compliance  with  the mandate of the statute.  There will be no-order as to  costs in this court. S. R.                          Appeal allowed and case remanded. 382",Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Civil  Second Appeal No. 46/75.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 1409 of 2006) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Leave granted. 2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellant. 3.      The facts in a nutshell are as follows: A Writ Petition was filed before the High Court for quashing the First Information Report (in short the \021FIR\022) lodged for alleged commission of offences punishable under Sections 420 and 424 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the \021IPC\022) and Sections 2 and 3 of the U.P. Gangsters and Anti- Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 (in short the \021Prevention Act\022). The stand in the writ petition was that even if the FIR is taken at its face value, there is no scope for holding that the appellants committed cheating or an offence punishable under the Prevention Act. At the most it may make out a case for evasion of tax for which action is permissible under the concerned Trade Tax Act. 4.      Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that in the cases referred to, a Division Bench of the High Court had disposed of large number of cases involving more or less similar prayers to quash the FIR in each case. It is pointed out that the High Court had categorised different type of cases and one of such categories was where no previous case was pending under any other law prior to initiation of investigation under the Prevention Act. It is also submitted that the appellants\022 case falls within the following parameters and guidelines formulated by the High Court: \023(a) It is expected that the investigation will be completed by the police within the prescribed limit under the general law i.e. Section 167 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by filing the charge-sheet or final report, if the accused is in custody within that period;. (b) It is expected that the Special Court will conclude the hearing of the cases, where rate http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of crime is not so higher by applying a summary procedure preferably within a period of 3-6 months from the date of filing the charge-sheet before the Court depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case; (c) In case of pendency of Appeal/Revision/Review by an accused, Special Court will be empowered to split up the file in respect of other co-accused to avoid delay in hearing the case; (d) If any person applied or surrendered or produced before the Court in connection with the matters where rate of crime is not higher, the Special Court expeditiously dispose it of following the principles as laid down in Smt. Amarawati and Anr. vs. State of U.P. (e) In case the Special Court found that the crime case is not so negligible nor the rate of crime is lower in nature, it will proceed strictly in accordance with law; (f)     It will be solemn duty of the Special Courts and the police authorities to follow the guidelines for the sake of investigation viz-a-viz personal liberties.\024 5.      The order of the High Court does not show as to how the ratio of the decision in a batch of writ petitions disposed of had any application or relevance so far as the present case is concerned. 6.      In the aforesaid circumstances, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to it to consider as to how the facts involved in Writ Petition No.10500 of 2005 and/or the ratio of that decision had any relevance so far as the present dispute is concerned. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. 7.

" O R D E R This Court  by order  dated April  2, 1996 had observed that leave  and licence  to run  a sales  counter granted on compassionate grounds and other liberties given to them were being abused by such persons and that the High Court was not right in  giving liberty  to the respondent No.1 to withdraw the writ  petition and  to file another writ petition on the same  cause   of  action.   Civil  Appeal   No.7084/96   was accordingly allowed and the appeal filed by Sudershan Kumari was dismissed  with costs.  A direction  was issued  to  the Notary to  show cause as to why the should not be prosecuted and punished  for attesting false affidavit of impersonation and why  his licence  should not  be cancelled  and  why  he should not be prosecuted for giving such false certificates. A notice  was sent to him on the basis of the name furnished by the  respondent and  also in the oath. It is now reported by the  Registry that  no such  person is  available in  Tis Hazari Courts.  Consequently by order dated October 23, 1996 Mr. Goburdhan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, was directed  to give the name of the Oath Commissioner lest proceedings should be initiated against the first respondent Sudershan Kumari who has filed the affidavit alleged to have been attested  by the Oath Commissioner which is found to be false. Accordingly  time was  given. It  is  stated  by  the learned counsel, Mr.  Goburdhan, that in spite of the letter written by  him, the  respondent is  not  responding.  Under these circumstances,  we are  left with  no  option  but  to convict the  first  respondent  Mrs.  Sudershan  Kumari  for producing   false    certificate   and   false   affidavits. Accordingly, she  is convicted  under Section 199 I.P.C. and sentenced to  undergo rigorous  imprisonment for a period of six months  and is  directed to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo a further sentence of six weeks. Both the sentences are  directed  to  run  concurrently.  This  order should be  sent to  the Sessions Judge, Delhi to enforce the sentence.

JAVED RAZACK & ANR                          Respondent(s) B.P. SINGH,J. In this appeal by special leave the appellant has impugned the order of the High Court of Judicature at Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad in Criminal Petition No.5314 of 1998 dated 8th June, 1999 whereby the application filed by the appellant under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the order of the XVTH Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad taking cognizance was rejected. We may notice that a complaint was filed by the respondent before the Metropolitan Magistrate complaining that when he had  gone to the chambers of the appellant, he had addressed him and his father in abusive language in the presence of several persons.  We nee d not reproduce the words used but it is clear to us on a reading of the complaint that the wo rds used are defamatory per se, particularly, when a vice-president of the Income tax appellate tribunal is said to have addressed those words to a practicing lawyer  and to the   father o f the complainant, who was also a member of the Income tax appellate tribunal. It is argued before us that  cognizance taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate of an offence under Sections 499 and 503 IPC is not warranted, and in any event, before taking cognizance the Magistrate ought to have referred the matter to the police under Section 156( 3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for investigation by the police.   We are not impressed by th e argument.  The magistrate after examining the complaintant on oath came to the conclusion, prima facie, that an offence was made out.   We find no fault with the Metropolitan Magistra te so far as this aspect of the matter is concerned.  Moreover, since the Magistrate has exerci sed his power to take cognizance, the same cannot be faulted on the ground that he had not referred the matter to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal  Procedu re.  It was submitted before that the imputations are mainly against the father of the complainant a nd, therefore, a complaint ought to have been made by the father of the complainant.  Reference was made to provisions of Section 199 of Cr.P.C.  On perusal of the complaint, we find that simi lar defamatory words were used against the complainant also apart from his father and, therefore , the right of the complainant to move the court and lodge a complaint before the competent magistrate cannot be challenged. In the result, we  find no merit in the appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed .","The appeal is dismissed in terms of the signed judgment.

" O R D E R This petition  has been  filed against the order of the Maharashtra Administrative  Tribunal made on 10.5.1996 in OA No.492/94 and batch. The  petitioners  are  Head  Constables  in  Maharshtra Subordinate Police  Service and on the earlier occasion when they had  filed writ  petitions in  the High Court, the High Court by order dated 30.4.1991 had directed that it would be open to the petitioners to participate in the regularisation process of  the candidates  who appeared  in the  year  1991 provided they filed their willingness within two months from the date  of the  order. The  marks secured  in the  written examinations conducted  in 1984-85 would be restored and the marks secured  in the  interview etc.  would be  taken  into account. In  case they  were found  eligible on  merit, they were to be placed in the merit list and considered according to rules  for promotion  as Sub-Inspector.  Admittedly,  the petitioners had  not filed the willingness within two months as directed  by the  High Court.  They filed a special leave petition against  the order and this Court had dismissed the same. We  are informed  that they  filed their  undertakings within two  months thereafter.  When  they  were  not  being considered and  requisition  was  sought  to  be  made,  the Government did  not accept  their applications.  Thus,  they have filed the present petition. Shri Sanghi,  learned senior  counsel appearing for the petitioner, has  brought to  our notice a circular issued by the Government  in which  permission was  granted to conduct the interview  afresh. It would appear that another batch of candidates has approached the Tribunal and obtained the same order from the Tribunal on the basis of which the Government have issued  the aforesaid  order. Placing reliance thereon, it is  contended that  since the Government have given three months’ time  in the said circular, the petitioners are also entitled  to   avail  of   that  benefit  of  appearing  for regularisation. It  is also  contended on  the basis  of the instructions  issued  across  the  Bar  by  the  instructing counsel  that   the  Director  General  of  Police  had  not conducted the examinations even for the year 1991 as pointed out by the High Court and, therefore, the petitioners cannot http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 be denied  of the  right to appear for viva voce as directed by the Division Bench. We cannot give any acceptance to the contention for the reason that  when the  High Court  had prescribed  the  time limit of  two months and when the petitioners had approached this Court  against the  direction given  by the High Court, the necessary  consequence would  be that either they should have sought  for extension  of time  from the  High Court or they should  have sought  further time  from this  Court for giving written undertaking. Unfortunately, they did not seek such extension of time. The Government, therefore, was right in not  considering  their  claims  after  filing  the  writ petition.  Mere  fact  that  another  batch  of  people  had approached the Tribunal and obtained similar orders directed by the  High Court  and the  Government had directed them to avail of  that remedy as per the circular, would not furnish any further  cause of  action to the petitioners to avail of that remedy.  On their,  own inaction,  the petitioners have committed default and they have to face the consequences. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.",Petitioners are Head Constables in Maharshtra Subordinate Police Service.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal, by special leave, arises from the judgment and order  of the  Punjab and  Haryana High  Court, made  on December 8, 1995 in RSA No. 2617/95. The appellants  had filed suit No.8 of 9.2.1978 against Arjan Singh,  son of  Badan Singh in the Court of Sub Judge, III class,  Patiala for  declaration that  the plaintiffs in that suit  were owners  and were  in possession from 1968 to the extent  of 5/6  share,  along  with  the  defendant,  of agricultural land  admeasuring 74 kanals 12 marlas comprised in Khewat  Khata Nos.5/5  Khasra No.68/1(7-10) etc. situated in village  Ghagga, Tehsil  Samana, District  Patiala. Arjan Singh had  admitted in  his pleadings  that the property was ancestral Hindu  Joint Family  and suffered  a  decree.  The present  suit  came  to  be  filed  by  Gamdoor  Singh,  the respondent in  this case  for a  declaration that the decree therein was collusive decree and did not bind him. The trial Court granted the decree. On the appeal it was confirmed and Second Appeal  was dismissed.  Thus this  appeal by  Special Leave. It is  contended by  Shri Ujjagar Singh, learned senior counsel for  the  appellants,  that  unless  the  respondent establishes  that   exists  Joint   Hindu  Family  of  three succeeding generations,  there is  no presumption  that  the property is  the co-parcenary  property. Therefore, the view of the  Courts below that it is a co-parcenary property  and that the  respondent by virtue of his birth in the family is entitled to  1/6 share  in the  property  and  the  previous decree to  which he was not member does not bind him, is not correct in  law. We do not find any force in the contention. It was  their own  case in  the previous  suit  that  it  is ancestral property  and that  Arjan Singh  and his  sons are members of  the join  family. Once  the existence  of  joint family was  not in dispute, necessarily the property held by the family  assumed the character of a co-parcenary property and every member of the family would be entitled by birth to share in the co-parcenary property unless any one of the co- parceners pleads,  by separate  pleadings, and  proves  that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 some of  the properties  or all the properties are his self- acquired properties  and could  not be  blended in  the  co- parcenary property. It is  settled law that even the self-acquired property can  also   be  blended  into  the  joint  family  hotchpoch enveloping the  character of  co-parcenary property.  It  is also not  pleaded in  the written  statement that  it is not joint family  property. The  very first  issue by  the trial Court which  was not   objected  to was whether the property was ancestral  property of the parties? The second issue was whether the plaintiff is entitled to joint possession of the suit land  and the  third issue  was  whether  the  previous decree   bound the  respondent? Under  those  circumstances, both the  parties proceeded on the premise that it was a co- parcenary property  belonging to the Joint Hindu Family. The finding recorded  by all  the courts  is that  the  property belonged to  Joint Hindu Family. Therefore, the finding that the respondent  is entitled to 1/6 of share by virtue of his birth is  well justified  and the  finding that the previous decree does not bind him as being tainted with fraud, is not vitiated by any error of law. It is  also an admitted fact that he was not a party to the earlier  suit and  the decree  was granted  without  his consent. Under those circumstances, the finding that it is a collusive decree  is a finding of fact based on appreciation of evidence.  Under those  circumstances, we do not find any substantial question of law warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","This appeal, by special leave, arises from the judgment and order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, made on December 8, 1995 in RSA No. 2617/95.

Sudhakaran,   Advs.  for   the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel for the parties. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  High Court  of Kerala,  made on  25.7.1996  in  Writ Appeal No.997/96. The admitted  facts are  the two  posts of Lecturers in Physical Education  were advertised  for recruitment  in the year 1988  through the  Public Service  Commission.  Written Test and oral interviews were conducted in the year 1992 and the Select  List, a  long list of 10 candidates was prepared by the  have already been appointed. Since there often exist some  vacancies,   the  appellant,   one  of   the  selected candidates, made  a representation  to appoint him. That was rejected on the ground that pursuant to the amendment to the Kerala Collegiate  Education  Service  Special  Rues,  1994, which came  into force  with retrospective effect from March 13, 1990,  higher qualifications  were prescribed  and since the appellant  did not fufil the requisite qualification, he was not  eligible and  could  not  be  appointed.  When  the appellant filed  writ petition,  the  single  Judge  and  on appeal the Division Bench of the High Court held that merely because he  was kept  in the  select list,  he  acquired  on absolute right  to appointment  and it is not incumbent upon the authorities to appoint him. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Shri  T.L.V.  Iyer,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the appellant, whether  when asked to find out from page No.2 of the selection  is made only to two posts or more, points out from page  No.2 of  the judgment  of the High Court that the advertisement was  restricted  to  the  existing  vacancies, namely, two  appoint the candidate from the waiting list, He http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 has no  right to  appointment. It  is contended that such an appointment is  violative of  Articles 14  and 16 (1) of the Constitution  of  India  as  the  candidates  eligible  when selection and get their rights tested. It is  settled legal  position that  merely  because  a candidate is  selected and kept in the waiting list, he does not acquire  any absolute  right for appointment. It is open to the  Government to  make the  appointment or not. Even if there  is   any  vacancy,  it  is  not  incumbent  upon  the Government to fill up the same. But the appointing authority must  give   reasonable  explanation   for  non-appointment. Equally, the  Public Service  Commission/recruitment  agency shall prepare waiting list only to the extent of anticipated vacancies. In  view of  the above settled legal position, on error is  found in the judgment of the High Court warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" (with CA Nos. 8485-8487/95, 8489-8491/1995 & 8492/1995) O R D E R This group of appeals raises common question of facts and law.  We, therefore, proceed to decide these appeals by a common judgment by noticing facts which have given rise to Civil Appeal Nos. 8483-8484/1995. In the said appeals, Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’) was issued on 7.2.1973 which was followed by declaration under Section 6 of the Act.  Subsequently, the Land Acquisition Officer, on 10.8.1977, gave an award.  The compensation offered to the appellants was 1,07,437/- + 15% solatium.  The claimants were not satisfied with the amount offered to them, therefore, they sought reference before the Civil Court.  The reference Court enhanced the compensation to Rs. 8,19,000/- + 15 % solatium + 4% interest.  Aggrieved, the State of Tamil Nadu filed Regular First Appeals before the High Court. The  High Court on the basis of the evidence led before the Reference Court came to the conclusion that the claimants were entitled to compensation only to the extent of Rs. 1,34,742.50 + 30% solatium and interest.  Aggrieved, the claimants have come up before this Court by way of separate special leave petitions. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants urged that the compensation awarded to the claimants in respect of the coconut and mango trees standing on the acquired land were not adequate and, therefore, compensation is liable to be enhanced.  Before the Reference Court, the State filed reports of Shri S. Murugesan, and Shri J. S. Sunderrrajan, Joint Director of Agriculture in respect of the value of the crop of coconut and mango each year from the trees standing on the land which was acquired. The said reports of Shri S. Murugesan and Shri J.S. Sunderrajan were proved by Thiru Seetharaman, RW-1.  The claimants examined Shri VN Madhava Rao, Professor and Head of the Department of Horticulture, Tamilnadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore.  The claimants’ said witness substantially agreed with the reports of Shri S. Murugesan and Shri J.S. Sunderrajan.  In view of the said reports, the High Court reduced the compensation.  However, in concluding  part of the judgment, the High Court stated that after all an estimate is an estimate for all practical purposes and it cannot be accurate, and considering the fact that there may be some fluctuations in the matter of estimating the yields from the trees and the value thereof, the claimants are entitled to 25% increase in the value over and above the said report.  In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and also the fact that the State’s own witness stated that groves and orchards owned by the claimants are the finest in the State of Tamil Nadu, we feel that the appellants are entitled to further 10% of the compensation awarded towards coconut and mango trees by the High Court. With this modification of the judgment under challenge, we affirm the judgment of the High Court.  The appeals are decided in the aforesaid terms. There shall be no order as to costs. ..J. (V. N.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. This appeal by special leave  arises from the order of the Punjab & Haryana High Court made on 21.4.1994 in C.R.No.3801/93. In a suit of perpetual  injunction   restraining  the   mother   of   the appellants from  constructing a  window in  the  joint  wall ABFAEDC between F & G, the trial Court granted the decree on the finding  that 1-1/2 ft. thick wall was a joint wall and, therefore, the  appellants’ mother  had no  right to  open a window in  the joint  wall. The  decree  had  become  final. Subsequently, the  admitted facts are that 30’ area with the aforesaid zig-zag  wall was  sold to  the  respondent-decree holders and  the appellants  have constructed straight wall. The respondent  in the  cross-examination had  admitted that the wall  AB is  9"" in width. The spot wall FG is also 9"" in width. The  house  was  constructed  by  Surinder  Kumar  in January 1991.  Wall AB  has also been constructed afresh. It was also  admitted that the wall A to B has been constructed by Surinder  Kumar  in  his  own  land.  In  view  of  these admissions, it is now clear that the wall B to A is 9"" thick constructed by  the appellants.  The only dispute is whether the wall  between G  to F  is a  joint wall.  In view of the admission made by the respondents that the present wall F to G is  also 9"" thick and in view of the fact that there was a sale made of the land in the zig-zag wall between a new wall and the  previous wall  GFAEDC, the  necessary conclusion is that the  joint 1-1/4  ft. thick wall no longer exists and a new wall has been constructed. The appellants having constructed a new wall admittedly from B  to A with 9"" width and the wall F and G also with 9"" width, the  necessary conclusion  would be  that the  entire straight  wall   was  constructed   with  9""  width  by  the appellants in  their own  land along with new house in which now the window is admittedly opened. It would appear that it http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was closed  due  to  the  contempt  proceedings  taken.  The question  is:   whether  the  decree    passed  in  1965  is executable under  Order 21  Rule 32,   CPC.  It says where a party against  whom a  decree for  perpetual injunction  has been passed,  has had  an opportunity  of obeying the decree and has  willfully failed  to obey  it, the  decree  may  be enforced in  the Case  of a  decree for  injunction  by  his detention in  civil prison  or  by  the  attachment  of  his property or  by   both. Though the appellants are successors in interest,  due to  the fact  that  there  is  an  altered situation after  the decree  was passed  and the  appellants had constructed a separate wall in their own land and opened the window,  the decree earlier passed became unenforceable. Therefore, the execution laid under Order 21 Rule 32, CPC is unenforceable and cannot be executed. The court  below, therefore,  were wrong  in proceeding under Order  21 Rule  32 CPC to execute decree which did not exist, It  is contended  by the respondents that in the sale deed executed by the appellant, they have mentioned the wall to be  the joint  wall. In view of the admission made by the respondents in  the evidence,  though the  recitals  may  be there, the  parties appear  to have  agreed for  the altered situation and in view of the altered situation when previous joint wall  is admittedly  of 1-1/2’  width and the new wall with only 9"" width, the appellants have reduced the width of their wall  and opened  the window  in their   own  land for enjoyment of  easement of  necessity of air. Accordingly, we hold that  the executing  Court  and  the  High  Court  were clearly in  error in  directing execution  of the old decree which no longer existed and the closure of the window. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the Punjab & Haryana High Court made on 21.4.1994 in C.R.No.3801/93.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R WRIT PETITION (C)NO. 444 OF 2002 1.      Applications for intervention/impleadment are dismissed. 2.      We have heard learned counsel for the parties at great length. 3.      The grievance of the petitioner was for appointment in Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) against vacancy which arose in the year 1992 and selection process whereof was completed in the year 1996 is highly belated. 4.      The brief facts are that the Haryana Public Service Commission issued an advertisement in November, 1992 inviting applications for 12 vacancies (9 for General and 3 for Scheduled Caste) for Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch).  The result of final selection was declared on 15th March, 1996.  The petitioner did not come in merit for appointment on the post of Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) but he was selected  in the Haryana Civil Service (Allied Services) and his name was recommended for post of ’A’ Class Tehsildar. 5.      The petitioner did not make any grievance against the selection process. However, after the judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 7422/1999 titled ""Sandeep Singh Vs. State of Haryana & Anr."" decided on November 09, 2000, the petitioner raised a grievance and started making representations that he may be appointed on the 4th vacancy because as per the roaster point every fourth vacancy was earmarked for a candidate from the  Scheduled Caste category.  Various representations of the petitioner did not find favour with the authorities and hence the petitioner approached this Court by way of present writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. 6.      In our view, the grievance of the petitioner is highly belated and at this distance of time, we do not think it proper to disturb the selection process which was completed in the year 1996.  Accordingly, we dismiss this writ petition.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgement of the  Division bench  of the Rajasthan High Court, made on November 15,1983 in special appeal no. 18/81. The respondent had purchased  the property  from Bhadaarmal on May 17,1958. Subsequenly, the  vender was  declared insolvent. Therefore, when the  proceeding were  sought to  be taken in respect of those properties,  the appellant  filed  an  application  to declare the  transfer of  the lands  made in  favour of  the respondent under Section 53 of the Provincial Insolvency Act to be  a fraudulent  one. All  the courts  have concurrently found, as a fact, that the sale transaction under Ex-A1 is a bona fide  sale for  valuable consideration executed in good faith and,  therefore, the  sale was not executed to defraud the creditors. Shri B.D.  Sharma, learned  counsel for  the appellant, contends that  the respondent  is no other than a practicing advocate. He  having obtained  the sale  deed, could not get physical possession  of  the  property.  Had  be  taken  the physical possession,  the things  would have been different. In an  appeal filed by the insolvent himself, the High Court had stayed  delivery of the possession subject to payment of rent. The finding that the possession was taken, thereby, is vitiated by error of law. These facts have not been properly considered by  the courts below in reaching that conclusion. We find no force in the contention. Admittedly, Ex.  A-1, sale-deed  makes a  clear recital that the  possession of  the property  sold  thereunder  was delivered to the vendee-respondent. The learned single judge of the  High Court  after  elaborate  consideration  of  the evidence recorded thus: ""There is  recital in the sale-deed (Ex. A1) that the possession of the apartments which were in possession of  the   transferor,   have   been delivered to  the transferor,  have been delivered  to the  transferee. Relying on  the testimony  of D.W.1 Yugalnarain,  which   supports  the recital made  in the sale deed (Ex. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A1), I  hold that the possession as mentioned in  the sale-deed (Ex.A1) in pursuance of it was delivered to the transferees. The inference that can  safely   be  drawn   from  the evidence and  broad facts  emerging therefrom  is   that  the  official receiver  has   not  succeeded   in establishing want  of good faith on the part of respondent No.1. As the Official  Receiver  has  failed  to discharge the  burden which  lay on him,  I   agree  with  the  learned district judge  when the found that issue No.1  has not been proved. it cannot be  said that  the sale-deed (Ex.A1)  was   not   for   valuable consideration and  in good faith, I hold that  the Official Receiver is not entitled to avoid the voluntary transfer of  sale made by Bhadarmal in favour of Yugalnarain. The sale, evidenced by Ex.A1, is not voidable against the  official Receiver  and it cannot be annulled."" This is  a finding  based on  appreciation of  evidence recorded by  the learned  single judge.  The Division Bench, therefore, was  right in  its conclusion  that ""there  is  a concurrent finding  of fact that the impugned transaction is a real  one and  with consideration"".  The trial  court held that the  sale was  made for  valuable consideration  and in good faith.  This finding  was upheld  by the learned single Judge. In  this view,  it being  a finding  of fact based on appreciation of  evidence, we  do not  find any  substantial question   of    law   of   public   importance   warranting interference. Even  the contention  raised  by  the  learned counsel was in a fact considered by the learned single judge and also the trial court. The direction to the vender to pay rent would  be in recognition of the title of the respondent as landlord  and vender  as tenant  in occupation.  Though a different conclusion could be reached, but that would not be a ground for this court to interfere under article 136. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. In view of the fact that Mrs. Naresh Bakshi, learned counsel took notice on behalf of the proposed legal representatives of the deceased respondent Nos.1, 2 and 9, the relevancy to give the particulars as pointed out by the office, no longer subsists. The only question is whether reference under Section 28-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is maintainable to the land acquired under the Defence of India Act. Initially, an extent of 1230.8 acres of land including the land of the respondents situated in Bhatinda in Punjab State was requisitioned for the purpose of defence of India. Obviously the acquisition was under Section 8 of the Requisition and Acquisition of the Immovable Property Act, 1952. An arbitrator was appointed under Section 8 [3] of the Act. The arbitrator in his award dated 19th January, 1985 determined the amount of compensation. Subsequent thereto, a writ petition seeking direction for reference under Section 28-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended by Act 68 of 1984, was filed in the High Court by the respondents. The counsel appearing for the Union of India in the High Court had conceded as mentioned in the impugned order that a reference could be made under Section 28-A and the award could be decided within two months from that date. Assailing that order dated 29th October, 1987 of the High Court in the abovesaid writ petition, viz., W.P. No.2482/87, this appeal by special leave has been filed. Shri Goswami, learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India contended that Section 28-A has no application to the acquisition of the land under the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952. We find force in the contention. Shri Ujjagar Singh, learned senior counsel for the respondents contended that since the counsel appearing for the Union of India has conceded before http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the High Court, the State is bound by the concession and that, therefore, there is nothing wrong in the order passed by the High Court. It is difficult to accept the contention. It is a case of total lack of jurisdiction since Section 28- A of the Land Acquisition Act has no application when the land is acquired under the Requisition and Acquisition of the Immovable Property Act. Therefore, wrong concession made by the counsel does not bind the Union of India in that behalf. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. We have  heard the  counsel for  both the parties. This appeal is  directed against  the order  of the  Civil Judge, Bijapur passed on October 29, 1991 and confirmed by the High Court in  the impugned  order made  on 5.4.1993  in CRP  No. 3565/91. The  facts are  clearly not in dispute. The service of the  respondent was terminated which order was ultimately set aside.  The order  has  merged  with  dismissal  of  the special leave  petition by this Court on July 31, 1989. This Court observed thus: ""The Management  may move the Government for reimbursement  of the salary paid to respondent No. 1 and the Government will decide that  question according  to  law and in  the light  of the stand taken by the University. In the  proceedings for  contempt, it  was held  by the Division Bench that normally the arrears of salary accrue to a person  whose termination  of service  is set  aside,  but payment depends  upon other  factors as well. In the absence of a  clear direction  while issuing  that writ,  it is  not possible to  hold that  the refusal  to pay  the arrears  of salary would  be an  act of contempt. Setting aside an order of dismissal  creates a  cause of action of claim arrears of salary. But  in such  case where  no direction was given for the intervening  period,  payment  of  salary  need  not  be ordered, as  held by  this Court  in Managing Direction U.P. Warehousing Corporation  & Ors.  vs. Vijay  Narayan Vajpayee [AIR 1980 SC 840]. Thereafter, it  would appeal  that the  respondent  had moved an execution application in the District Court to give effect to the order of the Tribunal which is envisaged under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Rules. Since the executing Court rejected the claim, the respondent went  in revision  under Section  115 of  Code of Civil Procedure  which was  dismissed in  the impugned order dated April 5, 1993 in CMP No. 3565/91 by the Karnataka High Court.  Pending  the  special  leave  petition,  an  enquiry whether the  respondent was gainfully employed was conducted and it was found that he was gainfully employed. It is  contended by the counsel for the respondent that this appeal  has become  infructuous. We  cannot conclude on that premise  since the  respondent is  claiming back-wages. There should  be a  finding in  that behalf. Accordingly, we held that  the respondent is not entitled to the back-wages. As  far  as  the  reinstatement  is  concerned,  it  is  not convassed by  the learned  counsel for the appellant that he is not  entitled for  the reinstatement due to the fact that the order of dismissal was set aside and had became final. The respondent  is entitled  to the payment of admitted salary from  the date of reinstatement. We do not propose to express any  opinion on  other consequential  benefits since the same is to be worked out in the light of the judgment of the Tribunal which was upheld by this Court. If the admitted salary from  the date of reinstatement is not paid, the same is directed  to be  paid within  a period of six months from the date of the receipt of this order.

The appellants were  acquitted  on  the charge under section 307/34 of the Indian Penal Code.   They were  convicted on two charges under section 325/34  of  the Indian Penal Code for causing grievous hurt to 317 Bapu  and Chunia.  They were sentenced to undergo  imprison- ment  for six months each and a fine of Rs. 500/- each  with six months, rigorous imprisonment in default. The  High Court on appeal maintained the conviction  and  in exercise  of  powers under section 423 (1A) of the  Code  of Criminal   Procedure  enhanced  the  sentence  to   rigorous imprisonment  for two years.  The High Court. said that  the learned trial Judge had taken a lenient view in awarding the sentences  to  the  appellants.  Bapu who  was  one  of  the victims  sustained  three  fractures on  his  left  temporal parietal  and occipital bones and totally lost his power  of speech.  The High Court said that for such serious  offences committed by the appellants they were awarded a sentence  of six  months rigorous imprisonment only by the learned  trial Judge. Counsel for the appellants submitted that by the end of  the month  of  October, 1971 the appellants  would  have  served sentence  for  10  months and this Court in  the  facts  and circumstances  of the case would reduce the sentence to  the period already undergone. The High Court in considering the question of sentence exer- cised  powers with reference to the facts and  circumstances of. the case.  The exercise of this power cannot be said  to suffer from any infirmity or lack of appreciation of  facts. Nor can it be said that the High Court was not justified  in observing  that the sentence passed by the trial  court  was lenient in the circumstances of the case.  It would be wrong to  interfere  with the sentence passed by the  High  Court. Any interference has to be supported by rules and principles in the administration of justice.  The ruling of this  Court on the question of sentence in the recent decision in  Surta & Ors. v. State of Haryana (Criminal Appeal No. 225 of  1970 decided on 12 February, 1971) is as follows ""This Court interferes with sentence only when it  is established that the sentence is  harsh or  unjust in the facts and  circumstances  of the case.  Sometimes consideration of age  has also  occasioned  interference.   There   ’are instances  of  interference  in  sentences  in cases of violation of statutory offences.   In the  present case, the Sessions Court and  the High  Court  both considered the  question  of sentence.   There  is  nothing  on  record  to suggest that the sentence passed is unjust  or harsh"". The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed. G.C.                       Appeal dismissed. 318","Nabi Bux, Noor Mohammad and Ismail Khan were tried by the Additional Sessions Judge, Rajgarh.

" O R D E R Though notice  has been  served on  the respondents, no one has appeared in person or through counsel. A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act [for short,  ‘the Act’]  was  published  on  July  16,  1970 acquiring  Ac. 2. 202 dec. of land in Survey Nos. 2309-2316, 2318, 2501,  2506-10, 2530-32  situated at village Pubakhand for the  purpose  of  construction  of  the  Tahasil  office building and  staff quarters  at Niali.  Along with the said notification, the appellant invoked the urgency clause under s. 17  (4) of  the Act dispensing with the enquiry under 5-A of the  Act. The  declaration under  s. 6  of  the  Act  was published   on April 27, 1972. Notice under ss. 9 and 10 was published in  the locality  in December, 1975 and possession of the land was taken on December 16, 1976. Sometime in 1977 O. J. C. No.43 of 1977 was filed questioning the validity of the exercise  of power  under s.17(4)  dispensing  with  the enquiry under  s. 5-A.  Similarly, some  other owners  filed O.J.C. No.1573  of 1978,  claiming interest  for part of the land pursuant  to a  sale made after the notification namely in November,  1973. Both  the writ petitions were allowed by the High Court on the ground that there was no justification to dispense with the enquiry under s. 5-A and public purpose would have  been served  by allowing the claimants to submit their objections. As regards  the second  writ petition, namely, OJC 1573 of 1978, the  petitioner therein cannot raise this objection because he is a subsequent purchaser and that the High Court was unjustified in allowing the writ petition. As regards OJC 43 of 1977, in view of the fact that the notification was  issued as  early as  on July 16, 1970, the writ petition  having been  filed after  7 years,  the  High court ought  to have  dismissed the  writ  petition  on  the ground of  laches. We,  therefore, hold  that the High Court has not  properly exercised  its power  under Article 226 of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the  Constitution   in  upsetting   the  notification  dated December 16, 1970 after a lapse of 7 years.

" JUDGMENT ORDER This appeal is directed against the judgment passed by the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 95 of 1988 dated 16th June, 2004 dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant/accused and thereby convicting the appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant took us through the entire evidence and the post mortem certificate and, in particular, the evidence of the doctor. We have carefully perused the evidence adduced on behalf of the respondent. We have perused the dying declaration given by the deceased on 25th January, 1987 at 22.30 p.m. It is seen from the remarks of the doctor that the patient, namely, the deceased was conscious and was in a position to give the statement recorded by the Magistrate. It is further seen from the above declaration that the deceased had love affair with the accused and that she opposed the accused marrying for the second time and that the accused on the fateful date pourded kerosene on her person and with the help of burning match stick set fire on her, due to which she received the burn injuries. It is clear from the dying declaration that the accused poured kerosene on her person and with the help of burning match stick set fire on her. We have also perused the medical evidence given by Dr. Ramesh Namuaji Bhange (P.W.6). It is seen from the doctor’s evidence that the deceased disclosed the history to the doctor that the accused poured kerosene on her body and set her on fire and that the judicial Magistrate has recorded the dying declaration of the deceased. It is also seen from the doctor’s evidence that before her statement was recorded by the Sub-Judicial Magistrate he had examined her and found that she was conscious and in a position to give the statement. Accordingly, the doctor has signed the endorsement appearing on the dying declaration. He has also identified his signature on the dying declaration. In cross examination nothing contrary has been elicited to discredit the doctor’s evidence. The doctor has also explained as to why he initially recorded the word ‘suicidal’ on the first page of the case papers and when he found the initial statement was wrong, he extracts the word ‘homicidal’ on the first page of the case papers. He has also explained under that circumstance he has recorded the word ‘suicidal’. The doctor also denied the suggestion made to him that the patient has not given him any history against the accused and it is also not correct to say that the dying declaration was not recorded by the Sub- Judicial Magistrate in his presence. We have also persued the other evidence tendered by the prosecution which in our view supports the case put forward by the prosecution. The learned judges of the Division Bench has considered the entire evidence tendered on behalf of the prosecution in its proper perspective and has come to the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 conclusion that the prosecution has clearly proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The reasons recorded by the learned Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court is cogent and convincing. The learned Judges have also affirmed the judgment rendered by the learned Sessions Judge, Pune for the ample reasons recorded in their judgment. We have not been persuaded to take a different view than the one taken by the Division Bench of the High Court. The involvement of the accused in the offence alleged has been clearly proved beyond any doubt. We have also no reason to disbelieve the dying declaration given by the deceased and the evidence tendered on the side of the prosecution. In our opinion, no case is made out for interference by this Court with the well considered judgment of the High court affirming the verdict of the learned Sessions Judge. Accordingly, appeal stands dismissed.","This appeal is directed against the judgment passed by the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 95 of 1988 dated 16th June, 2004.

" O R D E R This case  arises  of  alleged  ill-treatment  of  Mrs. Anamika Chawla  by her  husband and  her father. The case is going on  since 29th  July 1995. Smt. Anamika Chawla came up against the  order passed by the Metropolitan  Magistrate on 29th July,  1995 ordering to be admitted to Delhi Psychiatry Centre, 35,  Defence Enclave,  Vikas Marg,  New  Delhi,  for observation and  treatment. This Order was passed with undue haste  even  without  seeing  the  alleged  patient  Medical certificates were  produced from Dr. Sunil Mittal and Dr. S. C. Malik.  The case  of the petitioner, Mrs. Chawla, is that neither of the two doctors had ever met her or examined her. The allegation appears to be true. When the  application was moved by Mrs. Anamika Chawla, she was  staying in  Guild of  Service Hostel in  New Delhi. The warden of the Hostel appeared in person  and stated that she found  Mrs. Chawla’s  behaviour    normal.  She  was  on friendly terms  with the other inmates of the hostel. It was also recorded in the Order of this Court held on 3rd August, 1993  that   this  Court   had  personally   questioned  the petitioner and  had not  noticed any  mental aberration  bus since the  medical certificates had been produced before the Magistrate, we wanted to examine the case in greater detail. The case has now gone on a number of days. We heard the Doctors and  examined the  reports heard all the parties Mrs Chawla has  appeared before  us personally  on a  number  of days. We  have spoken  to her on all these days. We have not noticed the slightest  abnormality in her behaviour. We tried  to bring  about a  reconciliation between the husband and  wife but  unfortunately no reconciliation could be brought  about. The  parties  were  directed  to  undergo counselling which  has gone  on for  some time. We have seen records sent  by the  counsellor. We are of the view that no useful purpose  will be  served by  prolonging this case any further. We hold  that  there  was  no  basis  for  passing  the impugned order  dated 20th  July, 1995  by the  Metropolitan Magistrate. The Order is quashed. The Writ Petition filed in this Court  by Anamika  Chawla is  disposed  of  finally  as above. There will be no order as to costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","Smt.

On perusal of the award passed by the arbitrator, we are of the view that the award was supported by sufficient reasons and documents.  In that view of the matter, the trial Court as well as the High Court erred in law in interfering with the well-reasoned award passed by the arbitrator.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  has  been  filed  on  behalf  of  Managing Director, Chief  General Manager and General Manager, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd., a Government of India Undertaking, against an order  dated 4th December, 1990 passed by a learned Judge of Jammu  & Kashmir  High Court  directing the appellants to implement the  order dated  27th August,  1990 passed by the said High Court. It appears  that a writ petition was filed on behalf of the respondents  making a  grievance regarding non supply of coal inspite  of the  deposit having been made so far as the price of the coal was concerned. The stand of the appellants before the High Court was that the Income Tax Department had attached  the   money  which   had  been  deposited  by  the respondents for the supply of the coal. It is  an admitted  position that an exparte ad interim order was  passed on  27th August,  1990 by  the High  Court while  admitting  the  writ  petition  saying  that  in  the meantime respondents of the said writ petition shall release the coal  to  the  writ  petitioners  for  which  they  have received the payment. We are  informed that  a counter affidavit was filed. A petition was  also filed  for modification  of the aforesaid interim order  bringing to  the notice of the High Court the circumstances under  which the coal could not be supplied to the writ  petitioners. Thereafter  the  impugned  order  was passed saying  that the  aforesaid order  dated 27th August, 1990 must  be implemented  within two  weeks and a direction was given  to list  the  contempt  petition  alongwith  writ petition on  23rd December, 1990. In the meantime this Court on 20th  December, 1990  issued notice  on the special leave petition and  passed an  order staying  further  proceedings before the  High Court.

He is challenging  his  conviction  in this appeal. The  contention raised on behalf of the appellant is that no site plan was prepared by the police to  prove  that the  place  where the appellant was found sitting was a part of the public road.   In  our  opinion  this  contention  is misconceived.  The police officers who were examined in this case  and  also  the  bench  witnesses  have stated that the accused was found sitting on a bench  on  the  Mandia  Road. Thus  the  accused  was  found sitting on a public road and, therefore, neither the procedure under Section 42(2) of  the Act  was  required  to  be  followed  nor  the site plan was required to be prepared.  Another contention raised  by  the appellant  is that the requirements of Section 50 of the Act have not been strictly complied with.  We find no  substance in this  contention.    Section  50 prescribes the manner in which the search of the  person  shall  be  conducted.    No breach  of  any  particular  condition has been pointed out. Moreover, we find that P.W.  1 has stated  in  his  evidence that he had  complied  withe  those conditions.  P.W.  1 had informed the appellant about his rights.

" JUDGMENT [Arising out of SLP(C) No. 3160 of 2005] Dharmadhikari J. Leave granted. I have carefully gone through very elaborate and well- considered opinions differing with each other of learned Brethren Y. K. Sabharwal and B. N. Srikrishna JJ. With utmost respect to both of them, I am inclined to agree with the view expressed by learned Brother Srikrishna J. but only with a rider and a partly different reason which may I state below:- The main issue is regarding the scope of power of any judicial authority including a regular civil court under section 45 of the Act in making or refusing a reference of dispute arising from an international arbitration agreement governed by the provisions contained in Part III Chapter-I of the Act of 1996. I respectfully Agree with learned Brother Srikrishna J only to the extent that if on prima facie examination of the documents and material on record, including the arbitration agreement on which request for reference is made by one of the parties, the judicial authority or the court decides to make a reference, it may merely mention the submissions and contentions of the parties and summarily decide the objection if any raised on the alleged nullity, voidness, inoperativeness or incapability of the arbitration agreement. In case, however, on a prima facie view of the matter, which is required to be objectively taken on the basis of material and evidence produced by the parties on the record of the case, the judicial authority including a regular civil court, is inclined  to reject the request for reference on the ground that the agreement is ’null and void’ or ’inoperative’ or ’incapable of being performed’ within the meaning of section 45 of the Act, the judicial authority or the court must afford full opportunities to the parties to lead whatever documentary or oral evidence they want to lead and then decide the question like trial of a preliminary issue on jurisdiction or limitation in regular civil suit and pass an elaborate reasoned order. Where a judicial authority or the court refuses  to make a reference on the grounds available under section 45 of the Act, it is necessary for the judicial authority or the court which is seized of the matter, to pass a reasoned order as the same is subject to appeal to the appellate court under section 50(1)(a) of the Act and further appeal to this Court under sub-section (2) of the said section. Whether such a decision of the judicial authority or the court http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of  refusal to make a reference on grounds permissible under section 45 of the Act would be subjected to further reexamination before the arbitral tribunal or the court in which eventually the award comes up for enforcement in accordance with section 48(1)(a) of the Act, is a legal question of sufficient complexity and in my considered opinion since that question does not directly arise on the facts of the present case, it should be left open for consideration in an appropriate case where such a question is directly raised and decided by the court. With this addition, I agree with the view expressed by learned Brother Srikrishna J., and with his conclusion that the matter should be remitted to the original court for a fresh decision in the light of the view expressed by this Court.",The main issue is regarding the scope of power of any judicial authority including a regular civil court under section 45 of the Act.

This case  does not warrant interference for the reason that, admittedly,  the petitioner was charged for an offence under Section  302 read with 34 IPC for his involvement in a crime committed  on October  1, 1986. The Sessions Judge had convicted the  petitioner under Section 302 read with 34 IPC and sentenced  him to undergo imprisonment for life. On that basic the respondents had taken action to have him dismissed from service  since he  was working  as Junior  Clerk in the respondent-Electricity Board.  The petitioner challenged the validity of  the dismissal  order by  way of a special civil application filed  under Article  226 of  the  Constitution. Pending disposal,  the Division  Bench of  the High Court by its judgment  dated October  14,1992 acquitted  him  of  the offence. Consequently, while disposing of the writ petition, the  learned   single  judge   directed  the  respondent  to reinstate him  into  the  service  with  continuity  of  the service, but  denied back  wages. The  petitioner then filed letters Patent  Appeal No.319/93  which was dismissed by the impugned order  dated August  26,1993.  Thus,  this  special leave petition. The reinstatement  of the  petitioner into  the service has already  been  ordered  by  the  High  Court.  The  only question is:  whether he  is entitled  to back wages? It was his conduct of involving himself in the crime that was taken into account for his not being in service of the respondent. Consequent  upon   his  acquittal,   he   is   entitled   to reinstatement for the reason that his service was terminated on the  basic of  the conviction  by operation of proviso to the statutory  rules applicable  the situation. The question of back  wages would  be considered  only if the respondents have taken  action by way of disciplinary proceeding and the action was  found to  be unsustainable  in law  and  he  was unlawfully prevented  from discharging  the duties.  In that context, his conduct becomes relevant, Each case requires to be considered  in his own backdrops. In this case, since the petitioner had  involved himself  in a  crime, though he was later acquitted,  he had disabled himself from rendering the service on  account of conviction and incarceration in jail. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Under these circumstances, the petitioner is not entitled to payment of  back wages.  The learned  single judge  and  the Division  Bench   have  not   committed  any  error  of  law warranting interference. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner was charged for an offence under Section 302 read with 34 IPC for his involvement in a crime committed  on October  1, 1986.

Our attention was drawn to the charges framed against the respondent herein.  The charges reads thus :- "" Article 1 That Sri P.K.Kuttappan while working as EDDA Parakkadavu failed either to deliver or return to the Branch Postmaster 38 ordinary postal Articles entrusted to him for delivery on 16.3.1996, 18.3.1996 and 19.3.1996 and thereby failed to maintain absolute devotion to duty violating the provisions of Rule 17 of the P&T ED Agents (Conduct and Service) Rules, 1964.

In our opinion, the charges are very serious in nature. However, the Tribunal and the High court taking a lenient view of the matter ordered reinstatement with 50% back wages. In our opinion, the respondent, if at all, should have been reinstated in service only without 50% back wages and, therefore, the said part of the order passed by the Tribunal and as affirmed by the High Court requires modification.  We, therefore, modify the order passed by the Tribunal and as affirmed by the High Court and order only reinstatement and delete the direction in regard to payment of 50% back wages. The respondent shall be reinstated within one week from today. It is also pertinent to notice that the Special Leave Petition was filed on 23.06.2005.  This Court on 29.07.2005 has ordered only notice on the application for condonation of delay, Special Leave Petition and also on the prayer for interim relief. Thereafter, the matter was adjourned to several dates and no interim order was granted in favour of the appellant-Union of India.  Under such circumstances, the Union of India ought to have given effect to the order passed by the High Court dt.25.01.2005. Since there is no stay, the respondent, in our opinion, shall be entitled for reinstatement from 25.01.2005 and he is also entitled for salary and other perks from that date. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.","The appeal is directed against the judgment and order dt.25.01.2005 passed by the High Court of Kerala in O.P.No.19374 of 2002.

The  appellant claimed  higher scale  of   pay  as   Head  Compounder.  Though  the  Health Department in  Adaman &  Nicobar Island  had recommended  to consider his  case for  grant of special pay, the Government after elaborate  consideration in  proceedings dt.

Shri A.N.  Jayaram, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondents stated that this grievance was not made  by the  appellant at  any point of time. As a fact all those  who are  working in  Andaman & Nicobar Island, as per the  Fundamental Rules,  are being  paid Andaman special pay and  the appellant is not discriminated on that account.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(1) SCR 281 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The appellant and his brother were charged for double murder - one of Ashok Kumar and other of Ram Prasad, Appellant was convicted under Section 302 IPC and his brother for offence under Section 302/34 IPC by Court of Sessions. They were awarded life sentence. During the pendency of appeal in the High Court against conviction and sentence passed by the Court of Sessions, brother of the appellant died. The appellants’ appeal was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court. There was difference of opinion between the two learned judges, one expressed the opinion that the appeal of the appellant deserves to the allowed and the other learned judge was of the opinion that the appeal deserves to be dismissed. Both the learned Judges gave separate judgments which are fairly lengthy and contain a detailed examination of evidence. In view of this difference of opinion the matter was placed before a third learned Judge. The case of the prosecution is based on the ocular testimony of three witnesses PWs 1, 2 and 3, besides the testimony of the informant PW4 and other evidence including medical evidence produced in the trial before the Court Sessions. The third learned Judge, before whom the matter was placed, expressed the opinion that the appellant was rightly convicted under Section 302 IPC and awarded sentence of life imprisonment. In that opinion a brief reference has been made to the testimony of only one of the eye- witnesses, namely PW2 Smt. Kallania. According to the prosecution she was eye-witness to the murder of Ram Prasad and not to the murder of the other deceased-Ashok Kumar. The eye-witnesses to the murder of Ashok Kumar, according to the prosecution case, were PW1 and PW3. PW3 is an employee of PW1. Ashok Kumar deceased was brother of PW1, PW4 is father of Ashok Kumar and PW1 Sushil Kumar. In view of the opinion of third learned judge the appeal was dismissed by the High Court, The judgment and order of High Court is under challenge in this appeal. We have gone through the opinion of the third learned Judge. Unfortunately, except a brief reference to the testimony of PW2, the said opinion does not show that the leaned judge independently considered the testimony of other eye-witnesses, in particuiar-PWl and PW3. The judges in different dissenting opinions have given detailed reasons, for and against the acceptance of version as deposed by these eye witnesses. The third learned Judge, under these circumstances, was required to independently examine the matter and express his opinion. It is not permissible to only or merely indicate the agreement with one or other view without giving reasons therefore. Therefore, Mr.BB Singh, learned counsel for the appellant is right in his submission that the matter deserves to be remanded to the High Court so that it may be heard afresh by a third judge http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 so as to make available to the parties a reasoned opinion showing that the relevant evidence and submissions that may be urged by counsel for the parties have been independently considered. We refrain from expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and make it clear that merits have not been examined by this Court which aspect would be considered by the High Court (third Hon’ble judge) in accordance with law. In view of the fact that the appellant is in custody for a long period, we request the High Court to decide the matter expeditiously and, if possible, within a period of four months. For the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the judgment and order of the High Court in Crl. A.No.2091/80 and remit the matter to the High Court in terms aforestated.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NOS.403(NL)/86, 2057-58/81/3257 & 3258/82 O R D E R These appeals by special leave arise from the orders of the E.S.I.  Court, Faridabad,  Harayana. The facts in CA No. 402/86 are  sufficient for  disposal of all the appeals. The appellants are  establishments covered  under the provisions of the  Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 (for short, the ‘Act’). They did not pay the contribution for the year 1980- 81. Therefore,  the Corporation  had served  the  notice  on December 31,  1982 calling  upon the  appellants to  pay the damages on delayed payment with interest. The appellants had objected to  it by the petition dated February 14, 1983. The Corporation, over-ruling the objections, passed the order on February 18, 1983 imposing the damages in a sum of Rs.8843/- The appellants  challenged it  by filing  application  under Section 75(2)  of the  Act before  the Insurance  Court. The Insurance Court  by its  order dated  August  14,  1985  has upheld the  damages. Since  the CA  Nos.2057 &  2058 of 1981 were pending  in this  Court,  they  filed  the  appeals  by special leave  without availing  the appellate remedy in the High Court. The contentions  have been  raised by Sri S.K. Gambhir, learned counsel for the appellants. Firstly, it is contended that under  Section 94-A  of the  Act, Corporation  has been empowered to  delegate the  power to one of the officers but the officer-delegate  has not  power to  further delegate to any other  officer. Therefore,  exercise of the power by the officer is  bad in  law. when we requested Shri S.K. Gambhir to produce  the order  passed by the Corporation authorising the officer,  he is  unable to  place his hands on the order passed by  the Corporation. But he seeks to contend that the Regional Director, one Mr. G.R. Nair was a delegatee officer to whom  power was  delegated by the Corporation pursuant to its resolution.  Therefore, the  order is bad in law. Unless we look  into the  order passed  by the  Corporation, it  is difficult to  see whether  it is a further delegation. It is seen under  Section 95-A of the Act that the Corporation has been empowered  to authorise any of its officer. It would be obvious that the Regional Director is one of the officers in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the region;  necessarily,  he  is  a  competent  officer  to exercise  the   power  under   the  Act  on  behalf  of  the Corporation. It  was conceded in the lower court that he was so authorised.  So, the  officer has power to pass the order imposing damages and interest thereon for delayed payment. It is then contended that under Regulation 26 and 34 of the Regulation under the Act what is required is to purchase the contribution  stamps, affix  them and get them cancelled in time. If that is done by the employer then it can be said that the  employer has paid the contribution amount in time. Though Regulation  31-A which was brought in by Amendment of 1979, further requires the employer to submit the cards duly stamped  to  the  Corporation  that  is  a  mere  procedural formality for  showing that  the amount  has  been  paid  in respect of  the covered  employees. As  the cards  were duly stamped the  action taken  by the authority for imposing the penalty is bad in law. We find no force in the contention. It is  seen that  under Regulation  31-A, as amended in 1979, not  only the card should be duly stamped but also the same should  be produced  indicating due  compliance of  the deposit of  the employer’s  and the  employee’s contribution with the  Corporation. That has not been done. The Insurance Court had  found as  a fact that the compliance has not been done. The appellants have failed to prove the compliance, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, of the deposit of the contribution  as required under Section 85-B of the Act. The appellants  committed breach of the provisions entailing imposition of damages and interest on delayed payment. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The appeals by special leave arise from the orders of the E.S.I. Court, Faridabad, Harayana.

Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 2.      The appellant is a blind man.  He appeared in the recruitment test held in the year 1992 for selecting candidates for Class-III Posts in Bulandshahr Judgeship in U.P.  However, he was not selected and hence he filed a writ petition which was allowed by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court by his judgment dated 25.09.1997.  Against that judgment the State Government filed a letters patent appeal which has been allowed by the impugned judgment by the Division Bench.   Hence this appeal. 3.      The appellant has relied on G.O. dated 26.08.1993 which is Annexure P-I to this appeal.  That G.O. states that the U.P. Government has reserved 2 per cent posts for physically handicapped persons for direct recruitment in all groups of Government services.  The physically handicapped persons are those who are blind, deaf and dumb and otherwise handicapped.  There were altogether 30 posts for which the selection was held.  2 per cent of 30 is 0.6. Since 0.6 is more than half we round it off and hold that one out of the 30 posts is reserved for physically handicapped persons.  Since there was no other physically handicapped person who applied, in our opinion, the appellant was entitled to the post reserved for physically handicapped persons. 4.      In this view of the matter, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and it is directed that the appellant be appointed on a Class-III Post in Bulandshahr Judgeship forthwith. 5.      We are informed that the appellant is already working on the post in view of the interim order of this Court.  Hence he shall be regularized and allowed to continue working as a regular Class-III employee and shall be given all the consequential benefits.",The appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated 23.05.2001 in Special Appeal No. 445 of 2001.

Though the respondent was served on September  30,  1996,  he  did  not  appear.  Therefore,  we adjourned the  matter by  proceedings dated October 28, 1996 to see whether he appears or is represented through counsel. Even today, he has not appeared. The only  question is;  whether the direction issued by the Tribunal  to appoint  him in  future vacancy is valid in law?

It is also stated that he was not qualified for the post. We need not go into the question of his  qualification.

" JUDGMENT 2001 Supp(3) SCR 331 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The dissatisfied landlord is in appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi in Second Appeal Nos. 112-113/1979 dated February 23, 1996. The appellants filed Suit No. E-384/70 in the Court of Shri M.A. Khan VI Additional Rent Controller, Delhi seeking eviction of respondent nos. 1 5 on three grounds; however, the only ground which suvives is provided under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (for short ’the Act’). The allegation of the appellants was that respondent no. 5 was inducted as sub-tenant without the written consent of the appellants and therefore respondent nos. 1 to 4 who are the tenants should be evicted from the said premises. The respondents took the plea that the consent was obtained to sublet the premises. The learned Rent Controller, the Rent Tribunal and the High Court found that subletting in favour of the 5th respondent was without the consent of the appellants and ordered his eviction, however, the grievance of the appellants is that the other six sub-tenants are occupying various portions of the tenanted premises and therefore the courts ought to have ordered eviction of respondent nos. 1 to 4 instead of confining the order of eviction to respondent no. 5, one sub-tenant only. It appears from the pleadings that in the eviction petition the landlord stated that out of 8 sub-tenants, six sub- tenants were inducted into possession of different portions with his consent. It that be so, neither the tenants nor the sub- tenants could have been ordered to be evicted merely because one of the sub-tenants was inducted into possession of a portion of tenanted premises without the consent of the landlord. So far as respondent nos. 1 to 4 as well as the other sub-tenants are concerned there can be no legitimate complaint of sub-letting because even according to the petition of the appellants they were inducted as the sub-tenants with his consent. This is not a fit case to order eviction of respondents 1 to 4 under Section 14 (l) (b) of the Act. We therefore find no illegality in the order of the High Court warranting our interference. The appeals are therefore dismissed, but in the circumstances of the case, without costs.","Landlord is in appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi in Second Appeal Nos. 112-113/1979 dated February 23, 1996.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard counsel on both sides. It is  not in dispute that in OS No.22/62 filed against five persons,  there was a compromise by the appellant.  The appellant was  impleaded as  first defendant.   Pursuant  to compromise memo  dated June  7, 1972  filed under  Order 23, Rule 3 CPC, the Court passed a decree in terms thereof.  The clauses contained  in the memo were that the appellant shall continue to be in occupation as Manager of the trust for its administration and  the  deities  installed  in  the  plaint schedule property.   The two shops built by the appellant in the shrine  were declared  to be  continued  to  be  in  his possession subject to his performing the worship in the same way as  was done  by his  ancestors.  The money deposited by him in  OS No. 463/64 on the file of Second Additional Civil Judge, Bangalore  City was  agreed to be refunded to him and half the  institution  fee  was  also  to  be  refunded.  In furtherance thereof,  the appeal  was remanded  to the trial Court for  consideration of  the matter  afresh  as  against defendants 2 to 4.  In furtherance thereof, the suit came to be dismissed.    Again,  a  compromise  memo  was  filed  by defendants 2  to 4  in the  High Court and the High Court in the impugned  order dated  January  25,  1993  made  in  RFA No.176/80 recorded the compromise as against defendants 2 to 4 and  disposed of  the matter  in terms thereof.  Thus this appeal by special leave. Firstly, there  is a  difficulty  in  the  way  of  the appellant  for   the  reason   that  respondent  1(iii)  and respondent 2  died and  though steps  were  directed  to  be taken, no  steps have  been taken as against them.  It would appear that  counsel for  the petitioner  made an  affidavit proposing to  delete respondent 1(iii) and respondent 2 from the array of the parties.  Even if we accept that stand, the problem will  be whether  the decree  as compromised against defendants 2  to  4  could  be  set  aside  as  against  the appellant.   it is  seen that  in  the  first  instance  the appellant had  specifically compromised  the matter in terms of the  compromise memo which was recorded against him.  The litigation thereby  came to  an end.   When  the matter  was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 remitted to  the trial  Court,  it  was  confined  vis-a-vis defendants 2  to 4.  After the  disposal of  the suit by the trial Court,  pending appeal,  they came  to compromise with the respondent  and in  terms thereof, the compromise decree came to  be recorded  in which the appellant cannot have any grievance in  the matter  as against  him.   The  compromise decree referred  to in  the first instance would operate and he is  bound thereby.   The appeal, therefore, does not have any merit. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","It is not in dispute that in OS No.22/62 filed against five persons,  there was a compromise by the appellant. In furtherance thereof, the suit came to be dismissed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Division  Bench of the Karnataka High Court made on June 11, 1990  in Writ  Appeal No,  283/1986. The  controversy is regulated  by  the  Bombay  Paragana  and  Kulkarniki  Watan (Abolition) Act,  1950 (for  short,  the  ’Act’).  The  land bearing Survey No.87 of Fevadihal village was unassessed and uncultivable waste  land as  per the  Mutation Entry  No.313 dated August 50, 1960 The Assistant Commissioner, Dharwad in his order  dated June  17, 1964  assigned an  extent of  109 acres 34  guntas of  land in  the  said  Survey  for  public purpose, namely, grazing purposes for the village cattle. On 6.4.1964, it was decided that an extent of 100 acres of land in the  said Survey  be transferred to the Forest Department for afforestation.  The Government in its order dated August 1, 1964 granted actual possession of 100 acres of land to be handed over  to the Forest Department. It was entered in the Revenue records  by Mutation  Entry No.413  dated August  1, 1966.  The   Divisional  Commissioner  in  his  order  dated November 27,  1964 granted  92 acres  out of 100 acres to 23 persons for  cultivation and  remanded the  matter for fresh enquiry.  On  March  4,  1968,  the  Assistant  Commissioner regarded on  extent of  201 acres  34 guntas  of land in the same Survey  number to the respondents setting apart an area of 109  acres 34  guntas for grazing purposes of the village cattles and  he also  reserved  100  acres  for  the  Forest Department for afforestation. The Deputy Commissioner by suo motu order dated January 24, 1977 has cancelled the order of the Assistant Commissioner dated march 4, 1968. Feeling aggrieved,  the respondent  filed Writ Petition No.2236/77 in  the High  Court. The  learned single Judge of the High  Court by  order dated  December 4, 1985 has partly allowed the writ petition and directed to grant an extent of 201 acres  34 guntas  to the  respondent. When the appellant filed appeal,  the Division  Bench dismissed the same, Thus, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 this appeal by special leave. Whereas  the   first  respondent   has   been   served, whereabouts of  the second  respondent are  not known. So he must be  deemed to  have been served. They are not appearing either in  person or  through counsel.  In view  of the fact that the  order granting  100 acres  for  afforestation  and 109.34 guntas  for grazing  purposes having become final and not  challenged   earlier  by   the  Watandar,  they  cannot challenge the  same due  to reversal of the earlier order by Deputy Commissioner  in exercise  of suo  motu power. In the writ petition,  they could  not have  challenged the  order. They could  have challenged  only with regard to the residue of the  land which  should have  been considered. The reason beings that  the right  of the  Watan  under  Section  4  is subject to the rights created in Section 4-A of the Act. The Division Bench and the learned single Judge, therefore, have not  property   considered  the   controversy.   Since   the respondents are  not appearing, the orders of the High Court are set  aside and  the matter is remitted to the High Court with a  request to dispose of the writ petition on merits in accordance with  law.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. The State  of Karnataka  has filed  this appeal against the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the High Court in Criminal  appeal No.  237/81. The  four  respondents  ere convicted by the trial court under Sections 326 and 450 both read with Section 34 IPC. The prosecution  case was  that because  of the  family property dispute,  relations between  deceased  Nagappa  and deceased babu with the accused, who were all closely related to each  other, were  strained and that led to an assault by respondent Nos.  1-4 on  Nagappa when  he was working in the fields and which resulted in his immediate death and also on deceased Babu,  who was  taking rest  in his house and which also led  to his  death after about 10 days. The prosecution could not  lead any  direct evidence regarding the manner in which Nagappa  and Babu  were killed.  but the  trial  court relying upon  the statement  of deceased  Babu -  Ex. P.  42 convicted the respondents as stated above. The High  Court on  reappreciation of the evidence came to the  conclusion that  the statement  of deceased  Babu  - Ex.P. 42  was not  all reliable . The High Court pointed out that the statement of Ex.P. 42 was stated to have been given in presence  of PWs  3 and  12. But PWs, 3 and 12 positively stated before  the court that no such statement was given by Babu. The  assault on  Nagappa had  taken place in the field which was  three furlongs  away from  Babu’s house  and  the assault on  Babu took  place while  he was  resting  in  his house; and  yet, in  Ex.P. 42  there was  a reference to the assault on Nagappa in the field. The High Court taking these factors into  consideration  came  to  the  conclusion  that deceased Babu  had not  given the statement Ex.P. 42 deposed by the Investigating officer. There was  no other  evidence led  by  the  prosecution against the  respondents. The  high  Court  was,  therefore, right  in   acquitting  the   respondents.

" O R D E R The  Punjab   and  Haryana  High  Court  at  Chandigarh dismissed the  writ petition  of the  appellants in  limine, which has given rise to this appeal. On the  bare outlines  of the  matter, it is clear that there is  not much  scope for  interference at  our end. The appellants are  heirs and  legal representatives  of Mathura Parshad, deceased,  cashier-cum-member  of  the  Cooperative Society, respondent  no.3. On  his demise, it was discovered that he  had defalcated  large sums of money of the Society. Since a  dispute arose  between the Society and its deceased member, about  the recovery  thereof, the  heirs  and  legal representatives of  the deceased,  Mathura Parshad were made to face  proceedings. An arbitrator was appointed to go into the matter  in accordance with the provisions of Sections 55 and 56  of The  Punjab Co-operative  Societies Act, 1961. An award was  made by  the Arbitrator  against the  appellants, being heirs  and legal  representatives of  Mathura Parshad, deceased, not  only for  the principal amount found due, but also for the liability to pay interest at the rate of 16 per cent per  annum and  costs at  the rate of 2 per cent on the sum awarded.  On appeal  before the  Deputy Secretary of the Department, at the instance of the appellants, the liability to pay the principal sum was sustained but rest of the award i.e. pertaining  to interest  and costs  was struck off. The appellants’ writ  petition, as said before, was dismissed in limine by the High Court, repelling the plea raised that the dispute did  not squarely fall within the purview of Section 55 and 56 of the Punjab Co-operative Societies Act, 1961. Though the order of the High Court in sum and substance is in  approval of  the orders of the departmental officers, one claim  however, laid  in the  writ petition, needs to be highlighted. That  was contained  in ground (j) in paragraph 11 of the writ petition. It is reproduced hereafter: ""(J) That  in any case, the liability on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the  petitioners   cannot   exceed   the interest devolved  upon the  petitioners from late  Mathura Parshad. Late mathura Parshad  had  no  bank  balance  and  no property of  his. All  that he had was a share in  the ancestral  house in  which some  of  the  petitioners  established, then cannot  exceed the share of mathura Parshad in that house."" This was  a valid  plea. All  the same the dismissal of the writ  petition cannot have the effect of wiping out such plea which  would remain alive when the question of recovery would arise.  This plea was personal to the appellants. They cannot be  held liable  personally for the liability of late mathura Parshad  except to  the extent  of interest devolved upon them  from mathura  Prasad. If  such plea  is raised as defence in an appropriate forum, that plea shall not be shut out merely on account of the dismissal of the writ petition. No bar  of res  judicata would  be valid  to the thwart such defence as and when raised as such matter was not, and could not be,  directly and  substantially  in  issue.

" J U D G M E N T DHARMADHIKARI, J Leave to appeal is granted. The learned counsel appearing for the parties are finally heard on the merits of the appeal. The complainant has approached this court against a laconic order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Uttranchal granting amongst several co- accused, bail to accused-respondent herein who is facing trial with others in Crime No.148 of 2001 for offences under Section 302, 307, 323 read with Sections 147,148 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The provisions of Criminal Procedure Code confer discretionary jurisdiction on criminal courts to  grant bails to accused pending trials or in appeals against convictions. Since the jurisdiction is discretionary it is required to be exercised with great care and caution by balancing valuable right of liberty of an individual and the interest of the society in general.  In granting or refusing the bail, the courts are required to indicate, may be very briefly, the reasons for grant or refusal of bail.  The jurisdiction has not to be exercised in a casual and cavalier fashion as has been done by the learned judge in this case. Learned counsel appearing for the complainant severely  criticizes the order impugned granting bail to the respondent-accused.  It is submitted that respondent-Irsan was on bail pending  Criminal Appeal No.78 of 1998 filed by him with four co-accused persons.  It is during the bail period that he is alleged to have committed the offence of murder of Dr. Ayyub and injured Kayyum and Kalloo. Looking to the seriousness of the offence and nature of allegations, Sessions Judge, Haridwar, rejected the bail application on 31.10.2001. The learned Judge by his order dated 20.11.2001 granted bail to respondent-Irsan and has not indicated why he considered it fit to grant bail to only one of the accused. It is not apparent from the impugned order that the learned judge has given due consideration to relevant factors like the nature of the accusation, the evidence collected by the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 prosecution, the character, behaviour, antecedents and standing of the accused. We dis-approve the judgment rendered by the High Court. We were also inclined to undertake the exercise of going through the police papers and the evidence so far recorded by the trial court to consider the prayer of complainant for cancellation of bail but we refrain from doing so because learned counsel appearing for respondent accused Irsan informs that the Sessions trial in which the accused was enlarged on bail is proceeding with expedition and major part of evidence has been recorded. In the aforesaid circumstances, we direct the learned Sessions Judge, conducting the trial of the case to consider the present application of the complainant for cancellation of bail on the basis of the police papers and the evidence so far recorded in the case. We leave it to the judicious discretion of the learned Sessions Judge to continue the bail or cancel the same after hearing the counsel for the prosecution and the accused. The appeal, thus, stands disposed of.",Leave to appeal is granted. Learned counsel appearing for the parties are finally heard on the merits of the appeal.

" O R D E R The  famous city  of Puri  in the  State of  Orissa,  is  a municipality under  the Orissa  Municipal  Act,  1950.  It’s limits extends  upto the  sea waters, on the side of the Bay of Bengal.  Fish and  prawn caught by fishermen from the sea have all  along been  brought within  the  municipal  limit, sometimes through the nearest octroi checkpost on payment of octroi and more often without adopting that course. The fish and prawn  are then  taken to  the market by fishermen where they  are   sold  and  bought  by  non-fishermen  for  local consumption or  for export  to other  destinations.  In  the latter course, the goods inevitably are transported and have to pass  out through  octroi checkposts. The dispute between the parties i.e. the Puri Municipal Council and its officers on the  one side  and the Indian Tobacco Company Ltd. on the other,  as   projected  before   the  High   Court  in  writ proceedings centered  around the question whether the taxing provisions of the Orissa Municipal Act and the bye-laws made thereunder, permitted  the Puri  Municipal Council to charge octroi tax  on a non-fishermen merely found in possession of fish and  prawn within  the municipal  area, or while taking them out through exist points, or octroi posts. On challenge made by  the respondent  company to  the steps  taken by the Municipal Council,  the Division  Bench of Orissa High Court has taken  the view  that the  invoked bye-law  11(2) by the Municipal  Council   speaks  of  ’evasion’  authorising  the municipality to  effect recovery  of octroi tax on detection of that  happening but that word was considered by the Bench to be  distinct from  ’non-payment of octroi duty’ the doubt about which  could arise  when the commodity is found in the municipal area  in the  possession of  someone. The straight case of  the municipality  was that  it can,  under the said bye-law,  proceed   against  the   possessors  of   fish  or prawnsincluding exporters  of these  on the  premise of non- payment of  octroi tax.  That plea has been negatived by the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 High Court by a well-reasoned judgment. The word  expression  octri  committed  by  the  person bringing goods within municipal limits, since it is an entry tax. The person bringing the goods without payment of octroi is the  evader and  can certainly be brought within the ship of bye-law  11(2). A  person merely  in possession  of  such goods within  a municipal  area cannot be brought with ambit of bye-law  11(2) raising  a presumtion that he is an evader because he may not have caused the entry and hence be not an evader. On  the pleas of the municipality, the tax cannot be allowed to  assume the  character of  a possessory tax or an exit tax.  That would be against the text and content of the taxing provisions and their culpable part. the High Court in this fact  situation properly saw through the matter and, in our view.,  afforded appropriate  rellef to  the respondent, throwing out the specious plea of the appellant-municipality based on  the fact  that it  was not in a position to put up octroi posts  at every  conceivable point  alongside the sea shore. That  aspect is  the concern  of the municipality and not that  of the subject. If the words in the taxing statute fail, the tax must fail, without sentiment playing any role. For the  afore reasons,  the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. There shall be no order as to casts.","Puri is a municipality under the Orissa Municipal Act, 1950.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from the interim order passed by the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, made on February 19, 1997 in Writ Petitioner No.3520/95. The respondent  was appointed  on July  9, 1992  for  a period of one year. The appointment order read as under: ""Your   appointment    is    purely temporary for  a period of one year from 9.7.92  to end  of Session, in the leave/deputation/vacancy. After expiry of  the  above  period  your service  shall   stand   terminated without any notice."" Subsequently,  on   appointment  was   given   to   the respondent as  indicated in the order of the Division Deputy Director of Education (Genl), dated May 19, 1994 sent on May 21, 1995 which reads as under: ""That due  to refusal  of  sanction and  provision   from   the   State Government for the year 1993-94, no sanction was  granted for any class on grant-in-aid  basis. Information to all  Heads of  Schools should be sent  through  Deputy  Director  of Education,    Education     Officer (Secondary)      and      Education Inspector, Bombay."" Thus, it  could be  seen that  for the year 1993-94, no appointment came  to be made. The respondent filed an appeal in the Tribunal for direction. The Tribunal held that he had been appointed  against a  permanent vacancy  and  the  Head Master has  no authority to pass an order of termination. In the face  of the appointment order, such finding recorded by the Tribunal  is clearly  unwarranted. When  a writ petition was filed  seeking suspension  of the  order, the High Court vacated   the order  of stay  made in the impugned order. In the aforestated  facts, the case was clearly for the stay of Tribunal order pending disposal of the writ petition. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals  by special  leave arise  from the  order dated December  15, 1995  made in  LPA Nos. 155156/95 by the Bombay High  Court. We  need not traverse all the details of the litigation.  Suffice it  to state  that we  have  issued notice primarily  on the  question of the power of the court to re-schedule  the payment of the amounts under the consent decree. In  a consent  decree on  compromise, court would be loathe to  interfere  with  the  terms  thereof  by  way  of modification unless  both parties  give consent  thereto. On the last  occasion, when the matter had come up for hearing, Shri T.R.  Andhyrujina, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents,  had stated  that  pursuant  to  the  order passed by  the  High  Court  they  have  complied  with  the directions. Therefore,  by order  dated July  22,  1996,  we directed the respondents to file an affidavit as regards the dates on  which  compliance  had  bean  made.  In  pursuance thereof, an  affidavit has  been filed in which it is stated that all  the directions  have been  complied with  and  the payments have  been made  on  due  dates  except  the  three instalments to  be paid  in future viz.. first in this month i.e. September  96, second  in October 96, and the third and last  one,  in  December  96.  In  view  of  the  fact  that substantial amount  has already  been paid,  we do not think that it is a fit case warranting interference on the special circumstances. Another  area of controversy now sought to be raised is  the failure  to  hand  over  the  R.C.  books  in relation to  seven vehicles.  It is  stated in the affidavit and  records  have  been  placed  before  us,  to  show  the circumstances in  which the  R.C. books  could not be handed over in  relation to  five vehicles.  It is stated that with regard to  the sixth vehicle, it has been complied with now. As regards  the seventh vehicle, it is stated across the bar and also  in the  affidavit that  the vehicle  was sold as a scrap; as a consequence, R.C. book could not be handed over. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It is  stated by  Mr. C.  Sitaramiah, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants that vehicle was kept stationed and the  vehicle became a junk because of the conduct on the part of  the respondent  in not  allowing the vehicles to be used.

Keshwani for the Petitioners. 599 R. Karenjawala for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA  REDDY,   J.  On   an  allegation   that  the petitioners had  acted in  breach of an undertaking given by them in Suit No. 2308 of 1983 in the High Court of Bombay, a notice was  issued to them to show cause why they should not be committed  for contempt  of court. Cause was sought to be shown. A learned Single Judge of the High Court recorded the following finding: ""In my judgment the action of defendants Nos 4 and 6 clearly  shows utter  contempt for  the orders of the court and  under  taking  given  by  them.  I  have  no hesitation  in   holding  that  these  defendants  have committed gross  contempt of  Court...in  my  judgment, there is no circumstance whatsoever to take any lenient view of  the gross  contempt committed  by defendants 4 and 6  and both of them are liable to be punished under the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act."" On those  findings the  learned Single  Judge committed each of the two petitioners to the civil jail for the period of one month. Against the order of the learned Single Judge, the petitioners preferred an appeal to the Division Bench of the High  Court under s 19(1) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench and the present Special  Leave Petition  has been  filed against the judgment of  the Division  Bench. Shri  Ramesh  N.  Keswani. learned counsel  for the petitioners submits that though the Petition for  Special Leave  to Appeal  has been filed under Article 136  of the  Constitution, the  petitioners have, in law, an appeal as of right under s. 19(1) of the Contempt of Courts Act.  The submission  has only  to be  stated  to  be rejected as  totally lacking  in substance. Section 19(1) of the Contempt of Courts Act is as follows: ""An appeal shall lie as of right from any order or decision of  High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for contempt- (a)   where the  order or  decision is that of a single Judge, to  a Bench  of not less than two Judges of the Court; (b)  where the order or decision is that of a Bench, to the 600 Supreme Court; Provided that  where the  order or  decision is that of the Court  of the  Judicial Commissioner  in any  Union Territory, such appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court."" If the order of committal for contempt or Court is made by a  Single Judge of the High Court, there is one statutory right of  appeal to  a Division  Bench of  not less than two Judges of  the Court  If the order of committal for contempt of court  is made  by a Bench, an appeal lies as of right to the Supreme  Court.

On merits,  the  learned  counsel  submitted  that  the undertaking  given  was  not  in  respect  of  the  property concerned and  that in any case the learned Single Judge was not justified  in giving  certain directions  in addition to punishing the  petitioners for contempt of court. We find no substance in  the submissions  made by  the learned counsel. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 There was  a clear  breach of  the undertaking  given by the petitioners and  we are of the opinion that the Single Judge was quite  right in  giving appropriate  directions to close the  breach.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Madhya Pradesh  High  Court, Indore Bench,  made on October 25, 1995 in W.P. No. 1349/95. In this  case, we  are not  concerned with  the  controversy between the  appellant and  the University  as  to  why  the latter  kept   the  former  under  suspension  etc.  We  are concerned with  the  legality  of  the  termination  of  the project entitled  ""Chemical, Physico-Chemical Structural and theoretical investigations  of  alkali  and  alkaline  earth cation systems-Chemistry of use to biological and geological processes"" on  which the  appellant was conducting research. The Government  of India  in their  order had put one of the conditions for completion of project, i.e., condition No.XIII which reads as under: ""The   Dept.    of   Science    and Technology reserves  the  right  to terminate the  grant the  grant has not  been   properly  utilised   or appropriate progress  is not  being made."" It would appear that there was some dispute between the appellant and the University-Devi Ahilya University, Indore. In this  behalf, we  are not concerned therewith, though the appellant sought to place before us that he was not at fault and on  the other  hand, the  University  was  at  fault  in preventing him to complete the project. Notice was issued by this Court  to the  Union of  India.  Dr.  R.C.  Srivastava, Director in the Ministry of Science and Technology has filed an affidavit  in which  he has stated in paragraph 10 of the counter-affidavit thus: ""On 16.9.94, the Registrar has sent the  information   through  courier service the  current status  of the project and  facts  at  that  time. Prof.  Poonia   PI,  the  appellant herein was  still under  suspension and Dr. Bajpai Co-PI had refused to undertake   the    financial    and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Management  responsibility  of  the Project. Under  those circumstances and as per out DST Norms/Guidelines the Project  was terminated  by the Department on 22.9.94 at that stage and requested  University to submit and settle the final expenditure on the project  and to  return unspent balance to  DST if  any  and  final Technical Report."" In view  of this  report, we  think  that  it  being  a disputed question,  we  cannot  decide  the  matter  in  the appeal. Under  these circumstances,  liberty is given to the appellant to  approach the  Union of  India and apprise them that  he  did  the  research  in  the  project  as  per  the guidelines and made necessary progress; and if it is not so, to  give   the  reasons   therefor.  If  the  Government  is satisfied, appropriate  time may  be given  to the appellant for completing  the project.  It would be for the Government of India to take the decision in that behalf.

" J U D G M E N T [Arising out of SLP (C) No. 13910 of 2003] S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 603, Sector 38, Urban Estate, Gurgaon vide letter dated 15th December, 1999.   The Respondent paid the dues.   But the possession has not been given till date. The Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Union Territory, Chandigarh directed payment of interest @ 18% p.a. after two years from the date of deposit till the actual physical possession handed over.   It also directed to pay an amount of Rs.50,000/- towards mental agony and harassment and Rs.2,000/- towards costs. The Respondent did not go in Revision before the National Commission.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission, while setting aside the award of Rs.50,000/- granted by the State Forum towards mental agony and harassment, maintained the rest of the order of the State Forum.  We are told that interest @ 18% has been paid on 18th April, 2003.  As set out in our above-mentioned Order there can be no recovery of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 amounts paid to the Respondent.  We therefore see no reason to interfere.  We direct that the Appellants shall deliver possession within a period of one year from today.  If possession is not delivered within one year the Respondent will be at liberty to approach this Court. After the possession is delivered, the Respondent will be entitled to approach the State Forum for working out the escalation in the cost of construction.  The State Forum will then work out the escalation in the cost of construction as per the CPWD rates and award the same to the Respondent.  After giving the possession the Appellant shall execute sale deed and, if applied, also give permission to construct without claiming anything extra except the registration charges. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, made on 22.4.1996 in Writ Petition No.703/94. The appellant  claimed to  be a member of the Scheduled Tribes. Admittedly,  the appellant  is ’Tahkur’  by caste, a forward caste.  His frandfather  was shown as a ’Thakur’ but not as  ’Ka’ or  Ma’ Thakur.  In Maharashtra, ’Ma Thakur’ or ’Ka  Thakur’   are  described   as  Scheduled   Tribes.  The appellant, therefore,  claimed the  status  of  a  Scheduled Tribe  and  made  an  application  to  the  authorities  for issuance of  the Caste  Certificate. After  due enquiry, the Scrutiny committee  constituted negatived  the claim  of the appellant for  status of  a Scheduled  Tribe. The  appellant filed a  writ petition  in the High Court which observed out that the  Committee has  minutely enquired into the findings and stated as under: ""This  Court  cannot  examined  the material on  record as an Appellate Authority.   If    the   conclusion reached by Committee is possible on the  basis   of  the   material  on record,  then   this  Court  cannot interfere  in   exercising  of  its extra ordinary  jurisdiction  under Article 226  of the Constitution of India.    Accordingly     it    was dismissed."" Shri R.S.  Lambat, learned  counsel for  the appellant, contends that  the  Scrutiny  Committee  have  recorded  the finding in paragraph 8 as under: ""With  this   end   in   view   the Committee has  applied the affinity test and  concluded  that  affinity test was negatived. I feel that the respondent has  been giving  unduly high stress on the affinity aspect. It may  not be  necessary that  all Thakur  Scheduled  Tribes  have  an http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 affinity  with   Ka  Thakur  or  Ma Thakur.  The  amplication  of  this test  is   some  time   viewed   so mechanically   and   arithmetically (eligible) the  extraneous  factors such  as   educational  background, social environment,  vocational  up bringing etc. which play a map role in the shaping of one’s personality are lost sight of."" It is  contended that  the conclusion  reached  on  the basis of  the findings  of the  Committee is  not warranted. Therefore, the  High Court would have gone into the question and verified  the basis  on which the Scrutiny Committee has scrutinised the  claims of the appellant as a ’Ma Thakur’ or ’Ka Thakur’.  It is  true, as  pointed out  by the  Scrutiny Committee, that  each case is required to be examined in the facts and circumstances of the case. The notification of the President under  Article 342 of the Constitution, subject to the Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  Act,  1976,  is conclusive and  final. There are catena of decisions of this Court holding that the Court cannot examine, to find out the caste of the party, the basis of the certificate issued. The limited area  the Court  can survey  is  whether  the  caste mentioned  in   the  presidential   Notification  would   be applicable   to   the   claimant   or   not.   Under   these circumstances, we  do not  think that  the  High  Court  has committed any error of law warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Special leave granted. On a  report lodged  by Jnanerdra Parchchya, Anu Mandal Padadhikari,  Gooda,   a  case   under  Section  31  of  the Representation of  Peoples Act,   1950 (’Act’ for short) was registered against  Keshav Lal Thakur, the appellant herein, by  Thakur  Gangti  Police  Station  and  on  completion  of investigation a  report in  final form was submitted praying for his  discharge on the ground that the offence was a non- cognizable  one.   On  that   report  the   Chief   Judicial Magistrate, Godda,  took cognizance  as in his view, a prima facies case  was  made  out  against  the    appellant;  and aggrieved thereby  he moved a petition under Section 482 Dr. P.C. before  the Patna  High Court  wherein   he  contended, inter alia,  that the  cognizance was  barred by  limitation under Section  468 Dr.  P.C. A  learned Judge  of  the  High Court, who  entertained the  petition, ultimately  dismissed the same  being of  the view that under Section 473 Dr. P.C. cognizance could  be taken  beyond the period of limitation. The above  order of  the High Court is under challenge us in this appeal. We need  not go  into the question whether in the facts of the  instant case  the above  view of  the High  Court is proper or  not for  the impugned  proceeding has  got to  be quashed as  neither the  police was  entitled to investigate into  the   offence  in  question  nor  the  Chief  Judicial Magistrate to  take cognizance  upon the report submitted on completion of  such investigation. On the own showing of the police, the  offence under  Section 31  of the  Act  is  non cognizable  and   therefore  the   police  could   not  have registered a  case for such an offence under Section 154 Dr. P.C. of course, the police is entitled to investigate into a non-cognizable offence  pursuant to  an order of a competent Magistrate under  Section 155  (2) Dr. P.C. but, admittedly, no  such   order  was  passed  in  the  instant  case.  That necessarily means, that neither the police could investigate into the  offence in  question nor  submit a report on which the question  of taking  cognizance could have arisen. While on this  point, it  may be  mentioned that  in view  of  the proviso  to   Section  2   (d)  Dr.   P.C.,  which   defines http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ’complaint’,  the   police  is  entitled  to  submit,  after investigation, a  report  a  relating  to  a  non-cognizable offence in  which case  such a report is  to be treated as a ’complaint’  of  the  police  officer  concerned,  but  that explanation will not be available to the prosecution here as that  related   to  a   case  where   the  police  initiates investigation into a cognizable offence - unlike the present one   - but  ultimately finds  that  only  a  non-cognizable offence has been made out. On the  conclusions as  above we  allow this appeal and quash the impugned proceedings.","A case was registered against Keshav Lal Thakur under Section 31 of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1950 (’Act’ for short) The High Court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the cognizance was barred by the period of limitation under Section 473 Dr. P.C.

" Present: Hon’ble Dr. Justice A.S. Anand Hon’ble Mr. Justice K.T. Thomas J.S. Attri and Devendra Singh, Advs. for the appellants T. Sridharan and P.D. Sharma, Advs. for the Respondents O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. The appellants  were appointed as Voluntary Teachers on tenure basis  under the  Voluntary Teachers  Primary  Scheme 1991. Respondent  No.4 challenged  their  appointment  inter alia on the ground that he was academically more meritorious than the  appellants and  therefore the  selection Committee was not  justified in  preferring the appellants to him. The State Administrative  Tribunal Allowed the application filed by  Respondent   No.4  and  quashed  the  selection  of  the appellants by  itself judging  the comparative merits of the candidates. The  appellants have put that order of the state Administrative Tribunal dated 10th December  1992  in issue. In Dalpat  Abasaheb Solunke  etc.  etc.  Vs.  Dr.  B.S. Mahajan etc.  etc. (AIR 1990 SC 434) while dealing with some what an identical question, this Court opined: ""It is  needless to  emphasise that it is not the function of the Court to hear  appeals over the decisions of the  selection Committees and to scrutinize the  relative merits  of the candidates. Whether a candidate is fit for a particular post or not has  to  be  decided  by  the  duly constituted   Selection   Committee which  has  the  expertise  on  the subject.  The  court  has  no  such expertise .  The  decision  of  the Selection    Committee    can    be interfered  with  only  on  limited grounds,  such   as  illegality  or patent material irregularity in the constitution of  the  Committee  or its   procedure    vitiating    the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 selection,  or  proved  mala  fides affecting the  selection etc. It is not disputed  that in  the  present case the University had constituted the  Committee  in  due  Compliance with  the   relevant  status.   The committee consisted  of experts and it selected  the  candidates  after going  through   all  the  relevant material before  it, In  sitting in appeal over  the selection  so made and in  setting  it  aside  on  the ground of the so called comparative merits   of   the   candidates   as assessed by  the  Court,  the  High Court went  wrong and  exceeded its jurisdiction."" In the  instant case, as would be seen from the perusal of the  impugned order,  the selection of the appellants has been quashed  by the  Tribunal by  itself  scrutinising  the comparative merits  of the  candidates and  fitness for  the post as  if the  Tribunal  was  Sitting    as  an  appellate authority over the selection Committee. The selection of the candidates was not quashed on any other ground. The Tribunal fell in error in arrogating to itself the power to judge the comparative  merits  of  the  candidates  and  consider  the fitness  and  suitability  for  appointment.  That  was  the function of the selection committee. The observation of this Court  in  Dalapt  Abasaheb  Solunke’s  case  (supra  )  are squarely attracted  to the  facts of  the present  case. The order of  the Tribunal  Under the  circumstances  cannot  be sustained. The  appeal succeeds and is allowed.

" & CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 672 of 1989. From  the  Judgment  and Order dated  16.2.1988  of  the Madras High Court in Crl. Misc. Petition No. 12389 of 1987. R. Mohan and R.A. Perumal for the Appellant. R.K. Jain, Mrs. Aruna Mathur and A. Mariarputham for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by M. FATHIMA BEEVI, J. Special Leave granted. The  appellant  married the first  respondent  on  29.4. 1979. They lived together until 1982 and have two  children. They  separated and the legal battle commenced in 1983.  The first respondent moved the City Civil Court for divorce. The appellant instituted criminal complaint in the court of  the Metropolitan Magistrate. The complaint was taken  cognizance of  for offences under Sections 494, 496, 498-A,  112,  114, 120,  120-B and 34 IPC against the respondents. It  was  al- leged that the first respondent married the second  respond- ent  while the proceedings for decree of divorce were  still pending, the marriage was performed secretly in the presence of  respondent Nos. 3 to 6. On the application of the  first respondent the High Court by the impugned order quashed  the proceedings  before the Metropolitan Magistrate.  Hence  the appeal. Section  482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  empowers the  High Court to exercise its inherent powers  to  prevent abuse of the process of Court. In proceedings instituted  on complaint  exercise of the inherent power to quash the  pro- ceedings  is  called for only in cases where  the  complaint does not disclose any offence or is frivolous, vexatious  or oppressive.  If the allegations set out in the complaint  do not  constitute the offence of which cognizance is taken  by the  Magistrate  it is open to the High Court to  quash  the same  in exercise of the inherent powers under Section  482. It is not, however, necessary that there should be a meticu- lous analysis of the case, before the trial to find 167 out  whether  the case would end in conviction or  not.  The complaint  has  to be read as a whole. If it  appears  on  a consideration of the allegations, in the light of the state- ment  on  oath of the complainant that  ingredients  of  the offence/offences are disclosed, and there is no material  to show  that  the complaint is mala fide, frivolous  or  vexa- tious.  in  that event there would be no  justification  for interference by the High Court. The High Court without proper application of the princi- ples that have been laid down by this Court in Sharda Prasad Sinha v. State of Bihar, [1977] 2 SCR 357; Trilok Singh  and Others  v.  Satya Deo Tripathi, [1980] 86 CRL.  LJ  882--AIR 1979 SC 850 and Municipal Corporation of Delhi v.  Purshotam Dass  Jhunjunwala and Others, [1983] 1 SCR 895 proceeded  to analyse the case of the complainant in the light of all  the probabilities  in  order to determine whether  a  conviction would  be  sustainable  and on such premises  arrived  at  a conclusion  that the proceedings are to be  quashed  against all the respondents. The High Court was clearly in error  in assessing  the  material before it and concluding  that  the complaint  cannot be proceeded with. We find there are  spe- cific  allegations in the complaint disclosing the  ingredi- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 ents  of  the  offence taken cognizance of. It  is  for  the complainant to substantiate the allegations by evidence at a later  stage. In the absence of circumstances to hold  prima facie  that  the complaint is frivolous when  the  complaint does  disclose  the  commission of an offence  there  is  no justification for the High Court to interfere. We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the  impugned order and direct that the proceedings before the  Magistrate shall  be  restored and disposed of in accordance  with  the law. P.S.S.                                 Appeal allowed. 168","Appellant married the first  respondent on 29.4. 1979. They lived together until 1982 and have two  children.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeals Nos.  1267 and 1268 of 1978. From  the  Judgment and Order dated  3.4.78  of  the Punjab & 593 Haryana  High  Court in Regular Second Appeal Nos.  105  and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 601 of 1971. D.V.  Sehgal,  S.K.  Bagga, Ms.  Shurestha  Bagga,  Ved Prakash Jyani and Seeraj Bagga for the Appellants. Anil Kumar Gupta for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHARUCHA, J. The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana found no merit in Regular Second  Appeal No.601  of  1971  and  dismissed the  same  with  costs.  He allowed,  to the extent indicated in the judgment and  order under appeal, Regular Second Appeal No. 105 of 1971 with  no order as to costs. Learned counsel for the appellants fairly stated  that, in  view  of the judgment of this Court in Atam  Prakash  v. state  of Haryana & Ors., [1986] 2 S.C.C. 249, there was  no merit  in  the appeal against the order  on  Regular  Second Appeal No. 601 of 1971. Learned Counsel for the appellants, however,  contended that the decree made in Regular Second Appeal No.105 of 1971 was  in favour, inter alia, of dead man, namely, the  second appellant Rup Ram and that, therefore, the decree should  be set aside. We  find that after Rup Ram died an application  (Civil Miscellaneous No.1122/C of 1975) under Order 22 Rule 9  read with  Section  151 of the Code of Civil Procedure  was  made praying that delay be condoned, the legal representatives of the  deceased appellant Rup Ram be allowed to be brought  on record   and   the  abatement,  if,  any,  be   set   aside. Simultaneously,  a second application  (Civil  Miscellaneous No.1123/C of 1975) was filed under order 22 Rule 3 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying that  the three sons of Rup Ram be brought on record as appellants  in his  place.  In the order under appeal, the  learned  Single Judge,  stated,  ""Since  R.S.A  No.601  of  1971  has   been dismissed,  Civil Miscellaneous Application  Nos.1122-C  and 1123-C of 1975 have become infructuous and the same are also dismissed"". Clearly,  there  a misapprehension in the mind  of  the learned  Single Judge. The aforesaid applications were  made to  bring the heirs of Rup Ram on  record as  appellants  in Appeal No.105 of 1971 and, since 594 the  learned Single Judge was allowing that appeal in  part, he ought to have considered the two applications on  merits. However,  this  is not a good ground for setting  aside  the decree.  At the most, there would be a case for remand;  but even  that, we think, is not necessary for the  applications are  clearly allowable. There was a delay of 15 days in  the application  to  bring  the  heirs  on  record  and  it  was explained,  supported  by a medical  certificate,  that  the third  appellant, who was looking after the  appeals  before the  High  Court,  had  suffered  from  typhoid  during  the relevant  period. We are supported in the view that we  take by the judgment of this Court in Harjeet Singh v. Raj Kishor & Ors; [1984] 3 S.C.C. 573. In the  result, the appeals are dismissed. There  shall be no order as to costs. G.N.                                     Appeals dismissed. 595","Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHARUCHA, J.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI, J Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appellant  is the  wife of  one Selvam who has been detained  as   a  Goonda  under  Tamil  Nadu  Prevention  of Dangerous Activities  of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders,  Goondas,  Immoral  Traffic  Offenders  and  Slum Grabbers Act,  1982. The  Commissioner  of  Police,  Chennai City,  on  being  satisfied  that  Selvam  was  involved  in activities prejudicial  to the  maintenance of  public order and with  a view  to preventing  him from acting in the said prejudicial manner it was necessary to detain him, passed an order of detention on 23.8.97. The appellant  challenged that  order before  the  High Court of  Judicature at  Madras but her petition failed. She has, therefore filed this appeal. What is  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant is  that there  was unreasonable delay on the part of the Government in considering the detenu’s representation and, therefore,  his continued  detention  is  illegal.  The detenu had  made a representation on 7.10.97. The Governor’s Secretariat   received it  on 14.10.97. It was despatched to the Government  on 15.10.97.  It called  for remarks  of the detaining authority  on 17.10.97. The detaining authority in his turn  called for  remarks of the sponsoring authority on 21.10.97. The  sponsoring  authority  gave  its  remarks  on 24.10.97 and  they were  forwarded by  the Commissioner  was rejected by the Government on 10.11.97. The State Government was required  to explain  how it  dealt it  dealt  with  the representation between 15.10.97 and 10.11.97. Except stating that it called for the remarks of the detaining authority on 17.10.97 the  Government has  failed to  explain why  it had become necessary  for it  to call  for the  remarks  of  the detaining authority.  Even after an opportunity was given by this Court  on 12.5.98  to the respondents to file a counter affidavit dealing  with the  contentions raised in the S.L.P the Government  has failed  to file  any counter and explain why it had called for the remarks of the detaining authority and what  was the reason for not taking up for consideration the  representation   of  the   detenu  from  21.10.97  till http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 10.11.97. Though  the dely  is  not  long  it  has  remained unexplained. Though  the dely  by itself  is not  fatal  the delay which  remains unexplained  becomes  unreasonable.  In spite of  the this  well-settled legal  position  the  State Government has  failed to explain satisfactorily that it had dealt with  the representation  to the detenu as promptly as possible. It  appears that  oblivious of  the correct  legal position  and  its  obligations  in  matters  of  preventive detention it has dealt with the representation of the detenu in routine  manner. This  indifference of  the Government is the cause  for rendering  the  continued  detention  of  the detenu illegal.  We, therefore, allow this appeal, quash and set aside  the impugned  order of  detention and direct that the detenu  be released  forth with  unless his  presence in jail is required in connection with some other case.","The appellant is the wife of one Selvam who has been detained under the Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders and Goondas.

" THE 8TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.B. Pattanaik R. Mohan  Sr. Adv.  R. Nedumaran, V.G. Pragasam and Ms. Pushpa Rajan, Advs. with him for the appellant Naveen  R.   Nath  and   S.R.  Bhat,   Advs.  for   the Respondents. O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. These appeals  by special leave arise against the order of the  Administrative Tribunal, Tamil Nadu passed in OA No. 708/93  and  1685/93  on  August  2,  1994.  The  appellant- Corporation had  adopted a  dual policy  of  appointment  of Education Officers  either by promotion from the subordinate cadre or  appointment  by  deputation  from  the  Government service. It  would appear that the post of Education Officer was upgraded  to the post of Deputy Director and they sought appointment by  transfer of  a Government Officer to fill up the post  of Deputy  Director to  supervise the  educational standards  in   the   Corporation.   The   respondents-Union challenged the said action of the appellant in the tribunal. The Tribunal  while upholding  the power  of the Corporation had directed thus: ""Therefore, a  post in the cadre of the Corporation  equivalent to  the District Educational Officer should be created  to which  persons  from the Corporation’s  cadre  could  be appointed and such persons could be considered after  a minimum  period of experience  for  advancement  to the higher  post  in  the  rank  of Chief Educational  Officer to be in overall charge of the Corporation’s Educational Department."" Feeling aggrieved  against this  order, this appeal has been filed.  Shri R.  Mohan, learned  senior counsel for the Corporation, has contended that the creation of the post and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 prescription of  qualifications are  the legal policy of the Government or  the executive  policy of  the Government. The Tribunal cannot  give the  direction to  create a post or to prescribe the  experience as may be required as an incumbent to hold  the post.  We find  that  there  is  force  in  the contention. Learned counsel  for the  respondents, in fairness, was unable to  meet the contention but he sought to sustain this order on the ground that appointment by transfer affects in- service candidates.  We cannot  go into it because it is not the subject  matter in this case. Under these circumstances, as stated earlier, the question is: whether the Tribunal can give direction  to create a post or to prescribe the minimum qualifications for  the  post?  It  is  well  settled  legal position that  it is  the legal  or executive  policy of the Government  to   create  a   post  or   to   prescribe   the qualifications for the post. the Court or Tribunal is devoid of power  to give  such direction.  The impugned  direction, therefore, is clearly illegal. The  appeal   are  accordingly   allowed.  But  in  the circumstances without costs.",The post of Education Officer was upgraded to the post of Deputy Director. The appellant sought appointment by transfer of a Government Officer to fill up the post. The respondents-Union challenged the said action of the appellant.,special leave petitions,48.16
" JUDGMENT 2001 (3) SCR 747 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the judgment and award passed by"" the High Court of Karnataka and the claimant is the appellant. The appellant \vas travelling in a KSRTC bus bearing No. CAP 3590 on 26.2,1989. The bus was ""driven in high speed and in a rash and negligent manner; when the bus reached Ningadahalli village, passed through a pit On the road, the appellant sustained art injury on fight eye as a broken glass piece of windo-pane hit her eye-resulting in visual disability to the extent of 35%, She filed a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal seeking compensation. The Tribunal passed an award granting Rs. 53,500 alongwith interest @ 9%. On Appeal by the respondent, the High Court by the impugned judgment set aside the award passed by the Tribunal. Hence this appeal. The defence of the respondent before the Tribunal was that the said bus was not at all involved in the accident. The Tribunal on the basis of evidence recorded a finding that the bus was involved in the accident. Before the High Court, the only question that came up for consideration was whether the motor accident occurred at all as alleged. The learned counsel for the appellant urged that the Tribunal, on the basis of evidence, both oral and documentary produced in support of the case of the appellant and withholding of the documentary evidence by the respondent was right in holding that the bus was involved in the accident; the High Court gave undue emphasis to technicalities and niceties and arrived at a wrong conclusion that the bus was not involved in the accident. The learned counsel for the respondent argued supporting the impugned judgment. The appellant (PW-1), one Ramchandra Gandhale (PW3), an independent witness who was travelling in the said bus, have spoken in support of the claim. Exbt. P/4 is the case-sheet which shows that the appellant was admitted in the hospital on 27.2.1989. History in the case-sheet reads: ""While travelling in a Bus, Bus door glass broken due to stone throw and glass pieces fallen in right eye two days back."" The Tribunal found that the respondent did not produce copies of the log- sheet and control charts to show that the bus in question was not plied on that road on the date of the accident and the said bus was not involved. Thus on a proper appreciation of evidence, the Tribunal was quite justified in recording a finding that the said bus was involved in the accident. But we find that the approach of the High Court was wrong in appreciating the evidence in as much as it was technical and thrust was on niceties. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 When there were both oral and documentary evidence supporting the case of the appellant, which was accepted by the Tribunal, in our view, the High Court Clearly committed an error in reversing the judgment and award of the Tribunal particularly when the respondent withheld the documentary evidence in its possession. The High court agreed with the Tribunal as far as quantum of compensation is concerned. Hence, we find it difficult to sustain the impugned judgment Consequently, we set aside the same and restore the judgment and award of the Tribunal The appeal is allowed accordingly. No costs.","The appellant sustained art injury on fight eye as a broken glass piece of windo-pane hit her eye-resulting in visual disability to the extent of 35%.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated January  21, 1994 of the Madhya Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Gwalior  Bench in  O.A. No.  323/93. The  admitted facts are  that the  respondent was appointed prior to 1973. The Government  had introduced  the scheme  of  granted  two advance increments  for the Lower Division Clerks who passed the Hindi  typewriting test.  They prescribed  the last date for passing  the test  as July  30,1973 and those who passed the Hindi  typewriting test  prior to that date was declared eligible to get two advance increments. Since the respondent could not  pass the  test within  that period but passed the said test  in December, 1979, he filed the O.A. claiming the said benefit  on the  basis of  certain instructions  issued from time  to time,  viz. dated  April 20, 1974, January 15, 1979 etc.  Which are  marked as  Annexure R-3  to the  paper book. On  that basis,  it was  contended  that  he  is  also entitled to  the benefit  of two  advance  increments  .  On principle, we  agreed with  the State  that  the  Government having had  the power  to extend the benefit it also has the power to put a cut-off date. Consequently, the cut-off date, viz.,  July  30,1973  for  passing  the  test  is  a  proper classification. All those who did not pass the test prior to that date,  but appointed  earlier  to  that  date  are  not eligible to two advance increments on their passing the said test after the cut- off date. It is  contented that  the said  order is  not insisted upon with  regard to  those candidates  who passed  the test after July 30, 1973. It is made clear by the respondent that the Government  have issued  orders for  recruitment of LDCs with the  qualification of passing the typewriting test with effect from  that date.  Therefore, they did not insist upon passing the test for advance increments nor such an employee is granted  any advance  increment. It  is then contended by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the counsel  for the  respondent that  though those who were appointed after  that date  were not  given incentive of two advance increments,  by necessary implication those who were appointed earlier  are entitled to two advance increments as incentive. We  do not  appreciate the  contention  as  well- founded. Since  the Government  have  taken  a  decision  to appoint the  candidates with  typewriting examination  as  a qualification, the need to give additional increments to new appointees, after  the appointment, does not arise. It would arise only  in the  case of  candidates who  were  appointed prior  to   the  introduction   of  typewriting  test  as  a qualification which  was not prescribed earlier but who were given time  for passing  the  test.  The  cut-off  date  was accordingly  fixed   as  the  test.  The  cut-off  date  was accordingly fixed as July 20, 1973 and those passed the test prior to  that date  alone were made entitled to two advance increments and  those who passed the test thereafter are not entitled to the said benefit. Though this  declaration has  been given,  since we are informed that  the State  has not filed appeals against same orders passed by the Tribunal in similar cases, the payments made to the respondent is directed not to be recovered. This law will be applicable to all pending cases or any candidate who approaches the court hereafter. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the order dated January 21, 1994 of the Madhya Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Gwalior.

" O R D E R This  appeal   by  special  leave  arises  against  the judgment and decree dated August 4, 1981 of the Gauhati High Court at  Guwahati made  in S.A.  No. 17/76. The appellants- plaintiffs filed  the suit for declaration of title that the lands in Chaibari Village which were part of Machpara Estate were given  to  Dayamoyee  Devi,  daughter  of  Rai  Bahadur Prithiram Chowdhury,  the holder of the said estate as dowry at the  time of her marriage and that she and thereafter her successors including  the plaintiffs  had been in possession and enjoyment  of the  lands in  their own  right. The lands therein did not stand vested in the State of Assam under the Assam State  Acquisition of  the Zamindaries  Act, 1951. The trial court  decreed the  suit. But  on appeal, the District Judge reversed  the decree  and held that the appellants had failed to  prove that  the appellants possessed the lands in their own  right and  that it  was not  vested in the State. Accordingly, the suit was dismissed. In second appeal, while upholding the  findings of  the appellate Court, the learned Single Judge of the High Court held that if the compensation for the lands comprised in Chaibari Village were not paid, a conditional decree was passed directing the State to pay the compensation in respect thereof to the appellants. Thus this appeal by special leave. Shri S.K.  Nandy, learned  counsel for  the appellants, has contended  that since  the lands  had passed on from the Zamindar to  his daughter  as dowry, she became the absolute owner of  the property.  The State  had not proved that they had acquired  the land  under the  Act and that compensation was paid  to them.  Thereby the  lands did  not vest  in the State. The  High Court,  therefore, was not right in holding that the title of the land in favour of the appellants stood extinguished  under  the  Act.  We  find  no  force  in  the contention. The High  Court has  gone into  the question of adverse possession pleaded  by the  appellants  and  held  that  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 adverse possession is an encumbrance under the State Revenue Act and  it does  not bind  the State. Therefore, as against the State,  the appellant  had not  perfected her  title  by adverse  possession.   It  was  also  held  that  since  the appellants had  asserted title to the property, burden is on the appellants  to establish  that they  had  title  to  the plaint schedule  lands and  continued to have title thereto. Since they  failed to  establish the  title, the  appellants cannot be  held to  be the  owners of  the land.  High Court called upon the Government to produce certain notifications. Since they  were not  produced, the High Court had expressed its  displeasure  for  the  lethargy  on  the  part  of  the officials of the Government but that was not conclusive. The ultimate finding is that the appellants had not proved their title to  the lands  and they  did  not  form  part  of  the acquisition under  the Act. They did not remain as owners of the lands  and the  lands stood  vested in  the State. These conclusions reached  by the  High Court  are not vitiated by any manifest error of law warranting interference. However, the High Court had granted conditional decree, namely, the  payment of  the compensation,  if  not  already paid. It  is, therefore,  for  the  appellants  to  make  an application to the appropriate authority seeking payment, if not already  received, and  the  competent  authority  would consider and  dispose of the matter within three months from the  date   of  making   the  application   for  payment  of compensation, if not already paid. The appeal is disposed of in above terms. No costs.","Appeal arises against the judgment and decree dated August 4, 1981 of the Gauhati High Court at Guwahati made in S.A.  No. 17/76.

" J U D G M E N T The questions which have been referred to this Bench by a two judge Bench of this Court are, whether the prosecution is obliged  to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in  the   same  occurrence   and  whether   failure  of  the prosecution to  so explain  would mean  that prosecution has suppressed the  truth and also the origin and genesis of the occurrence. The  above questions  arose in  the  context  of divergent views  expressed in Jagdish vs. State of Rajasthan {(1979) 2  SCC 178]  and Hare Krishna Singh & Ors. vs. State of Bihar  [(1988) 2 SCC 95]. In the former a two judge Bench of this  Court laid  down the proposition that where serious injuries are  found on  the person  of  the  accused,  as  a principle of appreciation of evidence, it becomes obligatory on the  prosecution so  as to  satisfy the  Court as  to the circumstances under  which  the  occurrence  originated  but before the  obligation is  placed  on  the  prosecution  two conditions must satisfied : (i) That  the injury  on the person of the accused must be very serious: (ii) That  it must  be shown  that these  injuries must have been caused at the time of the occurrence in question. In the other case another two judge Bench of this Court held that it is not the law or invariable rule that whenever the accused  sustains an  injury in  the same occurrence the prosecution is  obliged to explain the injury on the failure of the  prosecution to  do so the prosecution case should be disbelieved. It has  now been  brought to  our notice that earlier a three judge   Bench  of this  Court had considered the above questions in  Bhaba Nanda  Sarma &  Ors. vs.  State of Assam [(1974) 4  SCC 396]  and held  that the  prosecution is  not obliged to  explain the injuries on the person of accused in all cases  and in  all circumstance  sand, according  to the learned, Judges,  it is not the law. The same question again came up  for consideration  before another three judge Bench of this  Court in  Vijayee Singh  & Ors.  vs. State  of U.P. [(1990) 3 SCC 190] wherein it has been held as under: "" In  Mohar Rai case [1968, (3) SCR 525], it is made clear that failure http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the  prosecution  to  offer  any explanation regarding  the injuries found on  the accused may show that the   evidence   related   to   the incident is not true or at any rate not  wholly   true.   Likewise   in Lakshmi Singh  case [1976  (4)  SCC 394] also  it is  observed that any non-explanation of  the injuries on the accuse  by the  prosecution may affect  the  prosecution  case  But such a  non-explanation may  assume great importance where the evidence consists of  interested or inimical witnesses  or   where  the  defence gives probability  with that of the prosecution. But where the evidence is clear,  cogent and  creditworthy the truth  from falsehood  the mere fact   that    injuries   are   not explained by the prosecution cannot by itself be a sole basis to reject such evidence, and consequently the whole case."" Since the  question raised  herein  have  already  been answered by  a larger,  Bench we send the record back to the Bench, hearing the connected appeal.","The questions which have been referred to this Bench by a two judge Bench of this Court are, whether the prosecution is obliged  to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in  the   same occurrence.

" O R D E R Heard the learned counsel for the parties. In view of the fact that the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is a complete code by itself providing for the rate of interest and the procedure for fixation of market price, it cannot be said that the judgment and order passed by the High Court awarding interest at the rate of 4 per cent for the award which was made prior to the amendment is, in any way, illegal or erroneous.

" THE 3RD DAY OF FEBRUARY,1997 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.T. Nanavati S.K. Kulkarni, Adv. for Ms.Sangeeta Kumar, Adv. for the appellants O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R This Special Leave Petition arises from the judgment of the Karnataka  High Court, made in C.R.P. No.1650/96 on July 9, 1996. Admittedly, the  respondents filed O.S.No.158/94 in the Court of District Munsiff, Navalagund. On grounds of lack of territorial  jurisdiction   the  plaint   was  returned  for presentation to  the proper court. Accordingly, after making necessary  amendment   to   the   plaint   the   respondents represented the  suit, which  came to  be numbered  as  O.S. No.10/91, in  Civil Court  at Dharwad. The petitioners filed an application  under Order  VII, Rule 10, CPC for dismissal of the petition on the ground that the plaint was materially altered, without  seeking permission  for amendment  of  the plaint as  required under  Order VI  rule 17,  CPC. The High Court dismissed the petition. It is  contended by  Shri Kulkarni, learned counsel for the petitioners, that since the petition had been filed with amended averments  in the  plaint, necessarily  it  must  be treated  to   be  a   fresh  plaint   and  not   one   after representation to  the proper court. We find no force in the contention. The  object of  Order VII, Rule 10-A is that the plaintiff, on  return of the plaint, can either challenge in an  appellate   forum  or  represent  to  the  court  having territorial  jurisdiction   to  entertain   the   suit.   In substance,  it  is  a  suit  filed  afresh  subject  to  the limitation, pecuniary  jurisdiction and payment of the court fee as  had rightly  been pointed  out by  the  High  Court. Therefore, it  cannot be  dismissed on  the ground  that the plaintiff made  averments which  did not  find place  in the original plaint  presented  before  the  court  of  District Munsiff, Navalgund.  It is  not  always  necessary  for  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 plaintiff to  seek amendment  of the  plaint under Order VI, Rule 17, CPC. At best it can be treated to be a fresh plaint and the matter can be proceeded with according to law. Under those circumstances, we do not think that there is any error of law  committed by  the High  Court in  giving  the  above direction. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","This Special Leave Petition arises from the judgment of the Karnataka High Court, made in C.R.P. No.1650/96 on July 9, 1996.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.84 OF 1986 Malli & Ors. V. Union of India O R D E R This case  relates to  the  notification  issued  under Section 4(1)  of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 published on October 24,  1961. The Land Acquisition Officer in his award dated  December   16,  1964   granted  compensation  at  the Rs.2,000/- per  bigha. On reference, the Additional District Judge by  his award  and decree  dated May 20, 1970 enhanced the compensation  varying between  Rs.2,000/- to  Rs.3,000/- per bigha  in respect  of ABC  Blocks. The High Court in the impugned judgment  dated September  11,  1984  enhanced  the compensation to  the uniform  rate of  Rs.7,000/- per Bigha. Dissatisfied  therewith,  the  claimants  have  filed  these appeals. Though there is some force in the contention of learned senior counsel for the appellants that there is a difference between  the   earlier  cases   and  this  case,  since  the notification in  the earlier  cases dated  back to  1959 and this notification  to 1961,  the sale  instances relating to the small  pieces of  land cannot be solely relied upon when lands of  an extent  of  around  16000  and  odd  bighas  is acquired. There  is no  proof of  these  sale  transactions. Moreover, even if they were true, 1/3rd of the value towards development charges  has to  be deducted.  This exercise was not done.  Even if  it is  done, the appellant will get less then what  was  awarded  by  the  High  Court.

The  learned counsel for the appellants contended that these 9 allottees, though  have   entered  into   agreements  to   sell   their properties, the  same is  subject matter of the pending suit in the  High Court.  Therefore, their  possession cannot  be disturbed. Since the High Court, both the Learned Judge as well as the Division  Bench, was not inclined to grant injunction as sought for, we are not persuaded to take a different view in that behalf.

We  have considered the  entire service  rules operating in the State of Orissa  and  also  various  instructions  issued  by  the Government from  time to time together with the note to Rule 71(a) of  the Rules. We have categorised various persons who are eligible  to superannuation  of the  age of 60 years and such of  those employees who have been fitted into class III and upwards, though they are skilled or highly skilled, they are not  entitled to benefit of 60 years for superannuation. They required  to retire  on attaining  the age  of 58 years while the  Class IV  employees, though skilled, semi-skilled or highly  skilled alone  are entitled  to  the  benefit  of superannuation of  60 years.

" O R D E R These special  leave petition  have been  filed against the judgement  and  orders  dated  May  27,1996  and  August 20,1996 passed by the Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court  in the write petition and the Review Petition in Regular Appeal No.191 of 1996 respectively. The  admitted  position  is  that  the  petitioner  was appointed on  ad had basis to the post of Legal Assistant in the respondent-organisation  . Rule 8 of the Punjab Roadways (Ministerial) State  Serve Class-III Rules ,1997 provides as under: ""8. No person shall be appointed to the service unless he has requisite qualification  and   experience  as specified in  column 3  of Appendix ’B’  to  these  rules  in  case  of direct appointment  and appointment by transfer  and those specified in column 4  of the aforesaid Appendix in case of appointment by promotion . 9 (1).  appointment to  the service shall  be  made  in  the  following manner namely:- a)  *    *     *     *      *     * * b)   in    the   case    of   legal Assistants:- i)       20   percent   by   direct recruitment; and ii) 80  percent by  promotion  from amongst the  Law Graduates  serving in the  Deptt. including  employees of the Punjab Roadways on the basis of merit-cum-seniority; or iii) by transfer or   deputation of an official  already in  service of Government of  India, if a suitable candidate is  not available  by the methods mentioned  in  sub  clauses http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (i) and (ii)."" A reading of Rule 8 would clearly indicate that all Law Graduates  serving   in  the  Department  are  eligible  for consideration of  promotion as Legal Assistants on the basis of merit-cum-seniority  subject to the qualification and the condition mentioned  in the Rules. Rule 9 (1) (b) postulates that 20%  of the  posts of Legal Assistants are reserved for direct recruitment.  Admittedly,   the petitioner came to be appointed as  direct recruit  on ad hoc basis to the post of Legal  Assistant   within  that   quota.  When   the  direct recruitment is  made, the  Government has  no power to relax the conditions  required to  be fulfilled for being eligible for appointment  by direct  recruitment and  to give further promotion to  the petitioner  as Legal  Assistant exercising the power under rule 22 relaxing rules 8 and 9 of the Rules. The Division Bench of the High Court, therefore, is right in its conclusion  that the  petitioner , having been appointed as Legal  Assistant on  ad hoc basis, could not continue any longer unless  a regular  recruitment was made. a direction, there fore,  was given  to the  respondents to  make regular recruitment and  in the  event of  regular  appointment  not being made  within three  months, the  petitioner would  not continue any  longer after the expiry of three months. Under these circumstances, we do not think that the High Court has committed any  error of  law  in  the  above  interpretation warranting interference.  it is  for the  Government to take appropriate action under the law.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP ) No.13898 of 2003) S. N. VARIAVA, J. Delay condoned. Special leave granted. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not placed in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 1162, Sector 14 (Part), Hisar, on 4th June 1991.  Substantial payments had been made but the possession was not delivered as development work had not taken place.  The Respondent filed the complaint before the District Forum. The District Forum by its Order dated 2nd June 1998 directed payment of interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of deposit till the date of offer of possession.         The State Forum, in the Appeal filed by the Appellants, reduced the rate of interest from 18% to 15% and directed interest to be payable after two years of the date of deposit.    The National Forum disposed of the revision in terms of its Judgment in HUDA vs. Darsh Kumar. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The Order of the National Forum cannot be sustained for reasons set out in our Judgment in the case Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra).  Each case has to be decided on the facts of that case.  Award of interest at the rate of 18% irrespective of the facts of the case cannot be justified. In this case, possession has been offered by a letter dated 12th November 1997 and interest @ 12% has been paid.  However, TDS appears to have been deducted.  We direct that the Respondent shall be entitled to take possession without any increase or escalation being claimed from him.  The Appellants to inform the Respondent that he can take possession.  As the possession is being delivered to the Respondent, in our view, interest @ 12% is sufficient.  The Appellants shall, however, pay to the Respondent the amount of TDS, which have been deducted, with interest @ 12% from the date the amount was so deducted till payment. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as it has been passed by taking into account special features of the case.

" O R D E R This is  an appeal  by Certificate under Article 133(1) against  the   order  of  the  High  Court  dated  the  28th September, 1977 of Calcutta High Court. The  only  question  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the Reference Applications made by the appellant were within the limitation as  provided under  the proviso to s.18(2) of the land Acquisition  Act,  1894  (for  short  ‘The  Act’).  The Notification under  s.4 of  the West Bengal (Requisition and Acquisition) Act II of 1948 was published on April 10, 1949. The  record   would  indicate   that  the  Land  Acquisition Collector appears  to have  made the award on March 22, 1951 and appears  to have  signed the  same on March 29, 1951. We are not  giving any  finding in  that  behalf.  Dissatisfied therewith the  claimants sought  for reference and the Civil Court enhanced the compensation. The State went in appeal to the  High   Court.  The  Division  Bench  noticed  that  the reference applications  were made beyond limitation and that therefore the  award of  the Civil  Court  was  held  to  be without jurisdiction. Thus, this appeal by Certificate. Shri Poti, the learned senior counsel for the appellant contended that  when the  award itself  was  signed  by  the Collector on March 29, 1951, the service of the notice under s.12(2) of  the Act  on February  6, 1951  appears to be not correct and  so the  Reference Applications which came to be made on  June 26,  1951 and  September 7  1951 are valid and within limitation  and the  High Court  was not justified in holding that Reference Application were beyond limitation. Having considered  the  paucity  of  evidence  in  this behalf, we  find that  it is  not desirable  to decide  this controversy without any factual foundation. We think that an appropriate course  would be that the Reference Court should go into the question:- (1) What  is the date on which the award as required  under s.12  read with  s.11 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was  made   by  the   Land   Acquisition Officer, in  accordance with  laws,  and notice as  required under  s.12(2)  were served on the claimants, if they are not present or  appeared through  counsel at the time  of announcing  the award under s.11? (2) What  are the  dates  on  which  the applications under s.18 came to be filed by the  claimants and  to decide whether the   applications    are   within   the limitation as provided under the proviso to s.18(2) of the Act? Since these  questions hinge  upon the  finding of fact and since  no positive  finding could  be recorded  in  this behalf on  the basis of evidence on record, we hold that the Judgment of  the High Court was not correct. Accordingly, it is set aside and the award and decree of the Reference Court is also  set aside.  The matter is referred to the Reference Court, firstly  to decide whether the Reference Applications were made  within limitation  in accordance with law. If the finding is  in favour of the claimant, then it has to decide the compensation according to law. Since it is an old matter the Reference  Court is  directed to  dispose of  the matter within 6 months from the date of the receipt of the order of this Court. The appeals are disposed of in above terms.","This is an appeal  by Certificate under Article 133(1) against  the  order  of the High  Court dated  the 28th September, 1977 of Calcutta High Court.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      The State of Madhya Pradesh is in appeal against the judgment of Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur, directing acquittal of the respondent. Respondent, who had been convicted for offence punishable under Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’) and sentenced to undergo RI for five years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/-, preferred an appeal against the judgment of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Tikamgarh.  The High Court accepted the appeal and directed acquittal of the respondent. 2.      The background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Achelal (hereinafter referred to as the ’deceased’), while in custody, was slapped and kicked on his testicles by the accused, who was the S.H.O., and that resulted in his death. The autopsy on the body of Achelal was conducted by a panel of three doctors on 14.12.1987.  The post mortem report is Ex. P-1A. According to this report no external or internal injury was found on the dead body. The cause of death has been shown as ’unknown’.  The viscera of the dead body was preserved.  It was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Sagar and as per report Ex.P-21, the presence of Ethyl Alcohol was detected therein. 3.      The respondent took the plea that he had not assaulted the deceased.  Placing reliance on the evidence of Kusum (PW- 6) who claimed to be witness, conviction was recorded by the Trial Court and sentence was imposed as noted above. The High Court found that the evidence of PW-6 was not reliable and in any event the medical evidence completely ruled out the version presented by PW-6. 4.      In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that the High Court has erroneously directed acquittal of the respondent.  Evidence of PW-6 should have been accepted and there was no contradiction between medical evidence and the ocular evidence. 5.      There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent in spite of service of notice. 6.      Two factors weighed with the High Court in directing acquittal i.e. (a) apparent contradictions in the evidence of PW- 6 and (b) her version being at variance with the medical evidence. The post-mortem was conducted by a team of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 doctors. It was noted that there was no external or internal injury and the cause of death is unknown. On forensic examination presence of Ethyl Alcohol was noticed. If the deceased had been subjected to kicks on vital parts or slapped as was stated by PW-6 there certainly would have been marks of injury.  Doctor’s evidence clearly rules this out. Further the evidence of PW-6 was rightly held to be unreliable by the High Court.  During investigation she has stated that the accused had slapped the deceased. There was no mention about the kick on the thigh or that the accused kicked the deceased after he fell down. Further the evidence of PW-2 (brother of PW-6) was to the effect that PW-6 had told him that the deceased was assaulted by Sub Inspector Pandey and the accused. Evidence of PW-6 is entirely different. It is true that in the case of custodial violence there would be less possibility of getting direct evidence, and direct independent witness. This was the position as indicated by this Court in State of M.P. v. Shyamsunder Trivedi and Ors. (1995 (4) SCC 262).  There were injuries on the body of the deceased in that case.  In the present case medical evidence clearly shows that there was no external or internal injury. 7.      Above being the position, the judgment of acquittal passed by the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference. 8.      The appeal is dismissed.","Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur, directed acquittal of the respondent.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL No  1994 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP (C ) No. 14309 of 2006) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J 1.      Leave granted. 2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court dismissing the Civil Revision Petition filed by the appellant-the Kerala State Electricity Board (in short the ’Board’).  Challenge in the Civil Revision was to the order passed by Learned Additional District No. 1 Mavelikara granting the enhanced compensation for alleged loss suffered by the respondent (hereinafter referred to as the ’claimant’) on account of drawal of electricity line over her property.  The dispute related to the compensation awarded for diminution in land value and the grant of interest. Relying on a full Bench decision on a Kerala High Court in Kumba Amma v. K.S.E.B. [2002 (1) KLT 542], the High Court dismissed the Civil Revision Petition. 3.      In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant-Board submitted that the High Court’s judgment is clearly unsustainable as the Full Bench decision in Kamba Amma’s case (supra) was set aside by this court in The Kerala State Electricity Board v. Livisha etc. etc.[2007(6) SCC 792] by the common judgment in Civil Appeal No. 289 of 2006 and other Civil Appeals. This Court set aside the impugned order in each case and remitted the matter back to the High Court for a fresh consideration.  It was inter-alia observed as follows: ""10. The situs of the land, the distance between the high voltage electricity line laid thereover, the extent of the line thereon as also the fact as to whether the high voltage line passes over a small tract of land or through the middle of the land and other similar relevant factors in our opinion would be determinative. The value of the land would also be a relevant factor. The owner of the land furthermore, in a given situation may lose his substantive right to use the property for the purpose for which the same was meant to be used. 11. So far as the compensation in relation to fruit-bearing trees are concerned the same would also depend upon the facts and circumstances of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 each case. We may, incidentally, refer to a recent decision of this Court in Land Acquisition Officer v. Kamadana Ramakrishna Rao5 wherein claim on yield basis has been held to be relevant for determining the amount of compensation payable under the Land Acquisition Act; same principle has been reiterated in Kapur Singh Mistri v. Financial Commr. & Revenue Secy. to Govt. of Punjab6, State of Haryana v. Gurcharan Singh7, para 4 and Airports Authority of India v. Satyagopal Roy8. In Airports Authority8 it was held: (SCC p.   533, para 14) ""14. Hence, in our view, there was no reason for the High Court not to follow the decision rendered by this Court in Gurcharan Singh case7 and determine the compensation payable to the respondents on the basis of the yield from the trees by applying 8 years’ multiplier. In this view of the matter, in our view, the High Court committed error apparent in awarding compensation adopting the multiplier of 18."" 12. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the High Court should consider the matter afresh on the merit of each matter having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. The impugned judgments, therefore, cannot be sustained. These are set aside accordingly. The matters are remitted to the High Court for consideration thereon afresh. The appeals are allowed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. 4.      There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent though notice has been served. 5.      Following the view expressed by this Court in the decision referred to above, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh consideration keeping in view the principles set out in the decision referred to above. 6.

The State Forum confirmed the Order of the District Forum but reduced interest to 15%.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission dismissed the Revision filed by the Appellants relying upon its own decision in the case of Haryana Urban Development Authority v. Darsh Kumar and observing that interest @ 18% p.a. has been awarded by them under similar circumstances. As has been stated in so many matters, the Order of the National Commission cannot be sustained.

It is  unfortunate that  long years  have been spent by the courts  below on  a combat  between two  parties on  the question of  court fee  leaving the real issues to be fought between them  to come  up leisurely.  Two things  have to be made clear. Courts should be anxious to 69 grapple with the real issues and not spend their energies on peripheral A  ones. Secondly,  court fee,  if  it  seriously restricts the  rights of  a person  to seek  his remedies in courts of  justice, should  be strictly construed. After all access to  justice is the basis of the legal system. In that view, where  there is  a doubt,  reasonable of  course,  the benefit must  go to  him who  says that the lesser court fee alone be paid. In this  particular case there is hardly any difficulty in holding  that the plaintiff in paragraph 14 of the plaint has clearly  alleged that sh., is in joint possession and is seeking partition  and separate possession of her half share in the  suit properties  as  heir  of  deceased,  Paramayee. Obviously, the  court fee  that is  payable is  as  she  has claimed, namely  under sec.  37(2) which corresponds to Art. 17(b)  of   the  Central   Act,  which  is  the  predecessor legislation on the subject. We allow the appeal and send the case back  to the  trial court  and  direct  that  court  to proceed with  the suit  expeditiously.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.1383 OF 1978 O R D E R Both the  appeals are  disposed of  by common judgement since the State and the aggrieved persons against the orders of the  prescribed authorities  etc. have ultimately come to this Court in this appeals. It is  not  necessary  to  narrate  all  the  facts  in details. Suffice  it to  state that  under Section 10 of the U.P. Imposition  of Ceiling  on Land  Holding Act 1960, (for short, ‘the  Principal Act’), proceedings were initiated and ceiling area  was determined. Thereon controversy has arisen as to the extent of the ceiling area required to be retained by the  respondent and surplus land that stood vested in the State which is the subject matter of appeals in this Court. Even  before  their  filing,  the  U.P.  Imposition  of Ceiling on  Land Holdings  (Amendment) Act,  1972 (Act 18 of 1973) (for  short,’the Amendment  Act’), had come into force with effect  from June  8,1973. Section  19 of the Amendment Act provides thus: ""19. Transitory  Provisions ---  (1) All proceedings  for  the  determination  of surplus land  under Section  9,  Section 10, Section  11, Section  12, Section 13 or Section  30  of  the  Principal  Act, pending before any court or authority at the time  of the  commencement  of  this Act,  shall  abate  and  the  prescribed authority shall  start  the  proceedings for determination  of the  ceiling  area under that  Act afresh  by  issue  of  a notice under  sub-section (2) of Section 9 of  that Act  as inserted by this Act: Provided that  the ceiling  area in such cases  shall   be  determined   in   the following manner  --- (a)  firstly,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ceiling  area  shall  be  determined  in accordance with the principal Act, as it stood before  its amendment by this Act; (b) thereafter,  the ceiling  area shall re-determined  in  accordance  with  the provisions  of   the  Principal  Act  as amended by this Act."" Sub-section (2)  thereof is  not material for the purpose of these cases, hence omitted. A reading  thereof would  show that all proceedings for determination of  surplus land  under Section 9 to 13, 30 of the Principal  Act pending  before any court or authority at the time  of the  commencement of  the Amendment  Act  shall stand abated and the prescribed authority shall start afresh the proceedings  for determination of the ceiling area under the Principal Act, by issuance of a notice under sub-Section (2) of  Section 9  of the  Principal Act  as amended  by the Amendment Act Ceiling should be determined firstly under the Principal Act  as it  stood  before  its  amendment  by  the Amendment Act. Thereafter, Ceiling area should be redermined as per the Amendment Act. The proviso provides procedure for determination of the ceiling area and the manner in which it requires to be done. As per  the  orders  of  the  prescribed  authority  on 24.2.1975 placed  on record  as Annexure  ‘E’  in  C.A.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R I.A. NO.10 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6607 OF  2005. This is an application filed by the respondent for clarification of the Judgment and Order passed by us on  20th  November,2006, in Civil Appeal lNo.6607/05, whereby we had disposed of the appeal in the following terms: ’We, accordingly, dispose of this appeal by setting aside the judgments and orders of both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court and restoring the judgment and order passed by the Tribunal. We, however, add that till such time as these 153 workmen are not absorbed against regular vacancies in the concerned category no recruitment from outside will be made by the appellant. Furthermore, even in matters of seasonal employment the said 153 workmen or the numbers that remain after regularization from time to time, shall be first considered for employment before any other workmen are engaged for the same type of work in the field.  The appellant should make a  serious attempt to regularize the services of the workmen concerned, in terms of the order passed by the Tribunal, as quickly as possible, but preferably within a period of two years from the dateof this order.\024 As will appear from the above direction, we had indicated that 153 workmen concerned were to be absorbed against regular vacancies in  the concerned category in terms of the Award passed by the Tribunal.  We had also indicated that the appellant should make serious attempts to regularize the services of the workmen concerned,  in terms of the said order of the Tribunal as quickly as  possible, preferably within a period of two years from the date of this Order. Mr. Ranjeet Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing in support of the application, submitted that till today none of the 153 workmen have been regularized in terms of our Order  or in terms of the Tribunal’s Order and instead  tenure appointments were being given so as to frustrate the Order passed by us.  Mr. Ranjeet Kumar also pointed out that the appellant was also obstructing the implementation of the directions given by us  on the ground that the said 153 workmen were not eligible for appointment in their respective category in terms of the eligibility criteria in existence after 1994. Having considered the submission made on behalf  of the respective parties, we clarify our directions contained in our said Judgment and Order dated  20th November,2006. by indicating that as far as the 153 workmen are concerned, the eligibility criteria in their cases would be as was existing on the date of the Tribunal’s judgment, namely, 6th June,1994.  We also make it clear that as far as age bar is concerned, since the said 153 workmen had not been given any further employment for 240 days after the judgment of the Tribunal, the condition which had been indicated by the Tribunal regarding relaxation of age bar by giving one year’s http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 relaxation to further 240 days would  apply in their cases. Accordingly, we direct that if the said 153 workmen were barred on account of being over-age oni8i the date of the order of the Tribunal, indicated hereinabove, the directions given by us will apply to them as well. The application for clarification is disposed of with the abovesaid directions.  The re will be no order as to costs.","This is an application filed by the respondent for clarification of the Judgment and Order passed by us on 20th November, 2006.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal b y special leave arises from the judgement of the  Allahabad High  Court, Lucknow Bench, made on August 6, 1993 in Writ Petition No.1126 of 1991. The  admitted  position  is  that  the  respondent  was appointed as an Ayurvedic Medical Officer on ad hoc basis by proceeding dated  October 11,  1983  in  the  pay  scale  of Rs.850-1720/-. He  remained unauthorisedly  absent from duty for 5  years. Thereafter,  on an  application made by him on April 14,  1989, he  was informed  by the  Government  Order No.5133 dated  September 8,  1989 that  he was  permitted to resume duty  on his  furnishing fitness  certificate with  a condition  that  his  unauthorised  absence  from  duty  was treated  as  a  break  in  service.  On  so  furnishing  the certificate, he  resumed duty.  Subsequently, the  Selection Committee was  constituted  under  Rule  4(3)  of  the  U.P. Regularisation of  Ad Hoc  Appointment (on  posts within the purview of Public Service Commission) Rules 1979 (for short, the ‘Rules’).  Subsequently, the  Rules came  to be amended. Rule 4 postulates that any person who was directly appointed on ad  hoc basis before January 1, 1977 and is continuing in service as  such on  the date  of the  commencement  of  the Rules, which  came into  force on  May 14,  1979,  would  be regularised subject  to the conditions mentioned thereunder. Rule 8  provides that  ""that services of a person, appointed on ad  hoc basis who not found suitable or whose case is not covered by  Rule 4(i)  shall be  terminated forthwith and on such termination,  he  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  one month’s pay"".  The case  of the respondent was placed before the Committee  on January  22, 1991  and he  was found to be unfit for  regularisation. Accordingly, his appointment came to be terminated. It was challenged in the High Court in the above writ  petition and  the High Court has stated that the appointment dated  September 8,  1989 was  fresh appointment and, therefore,  the termination  was bad in law. Thus, this appeal by special leave. The question  is: whether  the view  taken by  the High Court is  correct? It is seen that the Order dated September 8, 1989  clearly mentions  that the respondent was permitted http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to resume  duty subject  to production  of  medical  fitness certificate, his  unauthorised absence from duty resulted in break in  service. Thus,  it could  be seen  that the  Order dated September 8, 1989 is not an order of fresh appointment but a permission granted to the respondent to resume duty as Ayurvedic  Medical   Officer.  In  furtherance  thereof,  on production of  the medical certificate, he did join duty. On his so  joining duty,  his right  to the post dated back and flowed from  his initial  appointment, namely,  October  13, 1983. In  other words,  his ad  hoc appointment  got revived subject to  treating the period of unauthorised absence from duty as  break in service. Though there is break in service, it cannot  be considered  to be  a fresh  appointment as was held by  this Court  in Dayal Saran Sanan vs. Union of India [(1980) 3  SCC 25)  and Shiv Shankar & Anr. Union of India & Ors. [(1985) 2 SCC 30]. In view of the fact that the Committee duly constituted under the  Rules had  considered the  case of the respondent and found  him not  fit to  be  regularised,  the  order  of termination is  governed by  Rule  8  of  the  Rules.  As  a consequence, the question of conduction an enquiry of giving an opportunity  to the  respondent before termination of the service  does  not  arise.  The  view  of  the  High  Court, therefore, is clearly illegal. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the writ petition stands dismissed but, in the circumstances, without costs.","The appeal b y special leave arises from the judgement of the Allahabad High  Court, Lucknow Bench, made on August 6, 1993 in Writ Petition No.1126 of 1991.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO.478 OF 2006 G.P. Mathur, J. 1.      This petition under Article 32 of the Constitution has been filed praying for the following reliefs : ""PRAYER It is most respectfully prayed to kindly issue a writ of mandamus under Article 32 and direct the respondents to ensure and guarantee with immediate effect for :- (i)     Total ban on slaughter of cows, who are regarded by Hindus as their divine mother, to respect the Hindu religion and its followers of all sects as per details of petition. (ii)    Total ban on slaughter of horses in view of Vedic quotations quoted at para Nos.67A & 67B of the grounds. (iii)   Total ban on killing of buffaloes as a mark of gratitude, by Hindus for drinking her milk. Buffalo is to be regarded sister of mother cow. Commitment of the constitution in this respect also is pending since 26.01.1950. (iv)    Total ban on slaughter as proposed under Article 48 in its expression literally where personal interpretations have no say. (v)     Total ban on killing of a chameleon as it is being killed by Muslims by naming it Hindu-Hindu vide para 35(ii) of the grounds of appeal. The chameleon has suffered much killings since arrival of Muslims in India for about 1000 years as its only fault is that it hails name of ""Hindu"" as per Muslim concept.  Hindus are obliged to have sympathy for such an innocent creature."" 2.      We have heard the petitioners in person and have perused the record. 3.      It is not within the domain of the Court to issue a direction for ban on slaughter of cows, buffaloes and horses as it is a matter of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 policy on which decision has to be taken by the Government.   That apart, a complete ban on slaughter of cows, buffaloes and horses, as sought in the present petition, can only be imposed by legislation enacted by the appropriate legislature.   Courts cannot issue any direction to the Parliament or to the State legislature to enact a particular kind of law.  This question has been considered in Union of India v. Prakash P. Hinduja & Anr. (2003) 6 SCC 195, wherein in para 30 of the reports it was held as under : ""30.    Under our constitutional scheme Parliament exercises sovereign power to enact laws and no outside power or authority can issue a direction to enact a particular piece of legislation.  In Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v. Union of India (1989) 4 SCC 187 (para 51) it has been held that no court can direct a legislature to enact a particular law.   Similarly, when an executive authority exercises a legislative power by way of a subordinate legislation pursuant to the delegated authority of a legislature, such executive authority cannot be asked to enact a law which it has been empowered to do under the delegated legislative authority.  This view has been reiterated in State of J&K v. A.R. Zakki (1992) Supp. (1) SCC 548.  In A.K. Roy v.

" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 186, P.L.A. Sector, Hisar on 16.11.1990.   The Respondents paid substantial amounts but the possession was not delivered as the plot was encroached upon by the Police. The Respondent thus filed a complaint. On these facts, the District Forum awarded interest @ 18% p.a. on the entire deposited amount after two years of date of deposit till offer of possession. The State Forum directed that interest at the rate of 15% from date of re-allotment shall be paid.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission dismissed the Revision. As has been stated in so many matters, the Order of the National Commission cannot be sustained.  It cannot dispose of the matters by awarding interest @ 18% in all matters irrespective of the facts of that case.  Accordingly the Order of the National Commission is hereby set aside. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In this case possession has been delivered to Respondent in 2002.  A sum of Rs.2,17,614/- being interest at 12% per annum has also been paid on 21st December, 1999.    However, in making this payment TDS has been deducted.  We direct that the amount deducted as TDS be paid to the Respondent within 15 days from date of this Court along with interest thereon at 12% per annum from date the amount was deducted till payment.  Save as above, there will be no further or other Order in this Appeal. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  dated May  7, 1991  of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at  Chandigarh made  in RSA No.2260/80. The admitted facts are  that three  appellants along  with 27  others had gone in  a procession, in spite of the prohibitory order, to represent, to the Superintendent of Police at his residence, their  grievance   of  inadequate  accommodation  and  other facilities not  provided to  them. That was done after their duty was  over in  the  evening.  For  the  making  of  such representation and  for violating  the prohibitory order, an enquiry was  conducted against  the three appellants who had taken initiative  and led  the procession,  making a  charge that they  were guilty of grave misconduct under Rule 16 [2] of the  Punjab Police  Rules which  is  held  to  have  been proved; resultantly,  they were  dismissed from service. The order of  dismissal was confirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the appellants filed  suit for  declaration that  the  order  of dismissal was  null and  void and  inoperative; the suit was decreed on  April 7,  1979. On  appeal, it  was dismissed on February 20,  1980. In  the second  appeal, the  High  Court reversed the  decisions and  dismissed the  suit. Thus  this appeal by special leave. It is  true that the appellants are disciplined members of  the   police  force.   The   grievance   of   inadequate accommodation provided  to them is a legitimate grievance to be represented  to the  officer for its redressal.

Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that  they  have  committed  misconduct  warranting  extreme penalty of dismissal from service. Accordingly, the order of the High  Court is  set aside.

Learned  senior counsel for the petitioners it right when he contends that if the above clause is literally read, it would indicate that moment it is shown that the  landlord is  occupying any other premises of his own in the city, his suit for bonafide requirement of the suit premises can never be entertained and nothing more is required to be shown save and except establishing  on  record  that  the  landlord  is having other  premises of his own in the city.  It is not in dispute that the suit premises are situated  in  a  building where in other part the respondent - landlord is carrying on his  clinic and his need is for expansion of the said clinic and that  is  why  he  requires  the  suit  premises.    The aforesaid  contention  of  learned senior counsel would have required closer scrutiny but for the fact that  there  is  a decision  of  the  3  Judge  Bench  of  this Court in Boorgu Jagadeshwaraiah & Sons vs.  Pushpa Trading Co.  1998 (5) SCC 572, which repelled similar contention.  The  said  decision has  taken  the  view  on  a pari materia provision found in Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction)  Control Act,  1960,  wherein  Section  10(3)(a)(iii)provided  that a landlord may apply to the Controller for an order  directing http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building is  case  it is any other non - residential building, if the landlord is not occupying a non -  residential  building  in the  city,  town or village concerned which is his own or to the possession of which he is entitled  whether  under  this Act or  otherwise.   Construing these words, it was observed in para 8 of the report, as under :- ""That  the  aspects  of  quality, size and suitability of the building  have been  totally  put out of consideration by the courts below.   We  think  this  would frustrate the  purposes  of the Act.  Here would frustrate the purposes of  the  that the  non-residential premises he owned did not serve  the  purpose  of  his  need  of setting  up  a  textile and cloth business and that the need could  only  be  met  in seeking  eviction  of  the tenant from the premises sought."" Accepting the  said  contention,  this  Court  remanded  the proceedings for getting a finding on this aspect. In the facts of the present case, there is  a  clear finding  recorded  by  the Rent Controller as well as by the appellant court  that  300  sq.ft.    of  the  accommodation available  with  the  respondent-landlord in the building is insufficient for two doctors as the landlord  and  his  wife both are practising doctors. In  view  of  this  finding  arrived at on facts and accepted by the High Court, in our view, no need for  remand would arise.    The  ratio  of  the aforesaid decision would squarely state in the face of the petitioners. In the result, the petition fails and is dismissed.","Landlord's contention was that in the light of Clause 13(3)(vi)  of the  C.P. & Berar Rent Control Order, 1949, because the landlord is having other premises  of his own, the suit for possession of the suit premises was liable to fail. Learned  senior counsel for the petitioners it right when he contends that if the above clause is literally read, it would indicate that moment it is shown that the  landlord is  occupying any other premises.",appointment,20.38
" O R D E R Leave granted. The appellant  plaintiff laid  the suit for declaration of title and for possession of the plaint schedule property. On August  3,  1993,  the  appellant  filed  an  application enclosing the list of witnesses to issue summons to them for adduction of  evidences to  prove her case. In the affidavit filed by  the husband,  who is the general power of attorney holder, it  was stated  that he  was under bonafide mistaken impression that the list of witnesses was already filed, but he noticed  that mistake  when  he  was  getting  ready,  in consultation with  the counsel,  to adduce  evidence at  the trial. It  was, therefore,  stated that  the failure to file the list of witnesses was not international. Accordingly, he sought  permission   of  the  court  to  file  the  list  of witnesses. The  trial court  in its order dated September 6, 1993 dismissed  the application  holding that  there  is  no proper explanation  for the  delay in  filing  the  list  of witnesses. On revision, the High Court of Karnataka declined to interfere  with the  order. Thus,  this appeal by special leave. Order 16  Rules 1  and 1(A) adumberate that the witness at the trial court are to be produced for examination by the parties by  their filing  the  list,  and  omission  thereon prohibits them  to avail  the assistance  of  the  court  to secure their  attendance to  give  evidence  or  to  produce documents on  their behalf.  It is true that the legislature amended Order  16 Rule 1 and added rule 1(A) to see that the undue delay should not be caused in the trial of the suit by filing list  of witnesses or the documents at belated stage. Thereby, it  envisages that  on or  before the date fixed by the court  for settlement  of issues  and not  later than 15 days after  the date  on  which  issues  were  settled,  the parties are  to file  the list  of such  witnesses whom they propose to  call either  to  give  evidence  or  to  produce http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 documents and  they are  required to  obtain summons to such witnesses for  their  attendance  in  the  court.  On  their failure to do the same, Rule 1(A) says that they may without assistance of  the court bring witnesses to give evidence or to produce documents. In other words, if they fail to obtain the summonses through court for attendance of witnesses they are at  liberty to  have the  witnesses brought  without the assistance of the Court. It would,  thus, be  seen that  the legislature did not put  a  total  prohibition  on  the  party  to  produce  the witnesses or  the production  of the documents for  proof of the  respective   case.  Nonetheless,  when  they  seek  the assistance of  the Court,  they are enjoined to give reasons as to  why they  have not  filed the  application within the time prescribed under Rule 1 of Order 16. It is seen that in the  application  it  was  stated  by  the  husband  of  the appellant that  they were under the bonafide impression that they have  already filed the list of the witnesses alongwith the documents  and that  the mistake  of non-filing the list was discovered  when they  were getting ready for the trial. It is  not in  dispute that  the trial  is yet  to begin. In these circumstances, we think that the trial court committed illegality in refusing to receive the list for summoning the witnesses for  adduction of  evidence by  the plaintiff. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The orders of the trial court and the High Court are set aside. The list already furnished is a  valid list.  The trial court is directed to summon the witnesses for  examination on  behalf of  the plaintiff.  No costs.","The appellant  plaintiff laid the suit for declaration of title and for possession of the plaint schedule property.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. The petitioner  complains that  he  being  a  qualified candidate  with   Diploma  in   Engineering  and   Secondary Education  had  applied  for  the  post  of  Oversear/Junior Engineer (Civil  Engineering) as per the advertisement dated April 30,  1991 published  in daily ’Tarun Bharat’ on May 2, 1991. The  advertisement indicated  that of the 3 posts, two were reserved  for backward  classes and one was for general candidates. Petitioner  being a reserved class, hailing from the Scheduled  Caste, received  letter of  appointments from the  Chairman,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Zilla  Parishad, Gadchiroli; in  letter No.  PWB/Estt-I/1108/1/93 dated March 31, 1993  it was  stated that a recommendation had been made by Member  Secretary, Regional Subordinate Service Selection Board, Nagpur in their letter No. RSB/Nag/1210/M-792/PS-1/92 dated June  15, 1992  that 3  candidates were  selected. The names had  been repeated  and as regards the petitioner, his recommendation letter  No.RSB/Nag/1160/M-792/1992/PS-I dated July 31,  1992/7.8.92 was  said to  be issued  by the Member Secretary  selecting   the  petitioner  as  Junior  Engineer (Civil). Pursuant  thereto, he  came to  be appointed  as  a Junior  Engineer   with  probation   for  one   year.  After completion of  nine months  service, he  received the letter dated November  15, 1992  stating  therein  that  the  above letters carried unauthorised recommendations; therefore, the services of the petitioner were terminated. The order of the Chief Executive  Officer,  Zilla  Parishad,  Gadchiroli  was impugned by  the petitioner  and others in the W.P.No.885/93 in the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench claiming that they had  been  regularly  appointed  to  the  posts  which  were advertised;  therefore,   their  services   could   not   be terminated during  the probation  period  without  affording opportunity of  hearing in  the enquiry.  The High Court has dismissed  the  writ  petition.  Thus,  this  special  leave petition. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Shri A.K.  Sanghi, learned  counsel for the petitioners has contended  that when  the posts  were advertised and the candidates were  found eligible,  it does  not mandate  that there should  be an  interview and  selection Obviously, the Servicc Selection  Board having  found the  petitioner to be eligible and  qualified, recommended him and was accordingly appointed as  Junior Engineer,  when it  was  sought  to  be cancelled on  a letter  written by  Member Secretary  of the Service Selection  Board, they  are entitled to be heard. No such opportunity  has ever been given before cancellation of their  appointments.   lt  was,   therefore,  violative   of principles of  natural justice.  We find  no  force  in  the contention. It is seen that on their own admission they have merely applied  for the  post pursuant  to an  advertisement made for  the selection.  It is  the case  of the  Selection Board that  a regular selection has to be made and selecting the  eligible  candidates,  recommendation  for  appointment would be  made. Therefore, the letter said to be recommended conveying the  eligible recommendations were not correct and according  to   the  rules  when  such  being  the  admitted position,  we   do  not   find  any   fault  to  cancel  the appointments. Under  those circumstances, we do not find any illegality in  the action taken by the respondents. However, such things  will not  be permitted  to be  kept  under  the carpet. The State Government is directed to refer the matter to the  appropriate State  CBI  enquiry  and  the  concerned Inspector would  make and independent investigation into the matter to  find out  to who  were responsible  for such mal- practice committed  and it  will be open to take appropriate criminal prosecution launched against the culprits.

It is open for the Board to finalize the amount in terms of clause (4) of the Transfer Document even prior to 26th October, 2007 but while adjudicating on statutory and other deductions the Board will give a reasoned order specifying the sum concerning each of the sub-clauses of clause (4) of the Transfer Document so that there may not be any confusion in the mind of the parties.  It is made clear that if the ownership documents are not produced before the Board on or before 26th October, 2007 then the Board shall proceed with the execution proceedings as they are already proceeding.\024 It may be pertinent to mention that this Court in Civil Appeal No. 9446 of 2003 (Manish Mohan Sharma & Ors. v. Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd. & Ors.) on the basis of Memorandum of Family Arrangement passed a comprehensive http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 order on 21.3.2006.

" O R D E R It is  a sad  spectacle that new practice unbecoming of worthy and  conducive to  the profession  is croppingup. Mr. Mariaputham, Advocate-on-Record  had filed  vakalatnama  for the petitioner-respondent  when the  special leave  petition was  filed.  After  the  matter  was  disposed  of,  Mr.  V. Balachandran, Advocate had filed a petition for review. That was also  dismissed by  this Court  on April  24, 1996.  Yet another advocate,  Mr. S.U.K. Sagar, has now been engaged to file the  present application  styled  as  ""application  for clarification"", on  the specious  plea that the order is not clear and unambiguous. When an appeal/special leave petition is dismissed,  except in  rare cases  where error  of law or fact is apparent on the record, no review can be filed; that too by  the advocate  on record who neither appeared nor was party in  the main  case. It  is salutary  to not that court spends valuable  time in deciding a case. Review petition is not, and  should not  be, an  attempt for hearing the matter again on  merits. Unfortunately,  it has  become, in  recent time, a practice to file such review petitions as a routine; that too,  with change of counsel, without obtaining consent of the  advocate on  record at  earlier stage.  This is  not conducive to  healthy practice  of the  Bar  which  has  the responsibility  to   maintain  the   salutary  practice   of profession. In  Review Petition No.2670/96 in CA No.1867/92, a Bench of three Judges to which one of us, K. Ramaswamy,J., was a member, has held as under: ""The record of the appeal indicates that Shri  Sudarsh Menon  was heard and decided  on merits.  The Review Petition has  been  filed  by  Shri Prabir Chowdhury who was neither an arguing counsel when the appeal was heard nor  was he  present  at  the time of  arguments. It  is  unknown on what  basis he  has written  the grounds in  the Review  Petition as if it  is a  rehearing of an appeal against  our   order.  He  did  not confine to  the scope of review. It http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 would be not in the interest of the profession to permit such practice. That part, he has not obtained "" No Objection  Certificate""   from  the Advocate-on-Record in  the  appeal, in spite  of the fact that Registry had informed him of the requirement for doing  so. Filing  of  the  ""No Objection Certificate"" would be the basis for  him to  come on  record. Otherwise,  the  Advocate-on-Record is answerable  to  the  Court.  The failure to obtain the ""No Objection Certificate""  from   the  erstwhile counsel has disentitled him to file the    Review     Petition.    Even otherwise, the  Review Petition has no merits,  It  is  an  attempt  to reargue the matter on merits. On these  grounds, we  dismiss the Review Petition"". Once  the   petition  for   review  is   dismissed,  no application for  clarification should  be filed,  much  less with the  change of the advocate-on-record. This practice of changing the  advocates and filing repeated petitions should be deprecated with heavy had for purity of administration of law and salutary and healthy practice. The application  is dismissed  with exemplary  costs of Rs.20,000/- as  it is  an abuse  of the  process of court in derogation of healthy practice. The amount should be paid to the Supreme  Court Legal  Aid Services Committee within four months from  today.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  special leave arises from the order of the High Court  of Punjab and Haryana made on January 6, 1995 in C.N. No.6872/95.  The admitted facts are that the respondent was convicted  for an  offence of  murder and  sentenced  to undergo imprisonment for life. Admittedly, she was convicted on June  2, 1984  for an  offence committed on September 24, 1983. She  has been  in custody  from September 19, 1983. An application has  been  filed  in  the  High  Court  for  her premature release. In the impugned order, the High Court has directed the  release of  the respondent  on the ground that the State  had not  filed the counter-affidavit, in spite of that fact  that the  case was  adjourned on  more than three occasions. The  question is:  whether  the  High  Court  has jurisdiction under  Article 226  or under Section 482 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, the ""Code"") to release the prisoner. Section 433  of the Code empowers the Government, in an appropriate  case,   without  the   consent  of  the  person sentenced,  to  commute  the  sentence  and  to  prematurely release the  convict. Clause  (b)  thereof  provides  for  a sentence of  imprisonment for  life, for  imprisonment for a term not  exceeding 14  years or fine. Indisputably, she did not even  complete 14  years which  is a  minimum  mandatory sentence required  to be  served under the Code. At best the Court, in an appropriate case, where the prisoner has served the  mandatory   minimum  sentence,   may  only  direct  the appropriate Government  to consider  the commutation  of the sentence and  prematurely release  a particular convict. The can do  no  further.  The  Government  would  consider  such direction based  upon the  conduct of the prisoner and other relevant circumstances and act upon it. Thus considered,  we are of the view that the High Court had committed grave  error of  law in  directing release  of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 convict on  the lapse  on the part of the appellant-State in filing the counter-affidavit.

When the  respondent failed  to be represented pursuant to the notice issued by this Court, we requested the Supreme Court  Legal  Services  Committee  to  assign  the  counsel. Accordingly, Smt. K. Sarda Devi has been assigned the case. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Administrative  Tribunal, Madras, made on April 22, 1996 in  O.A.   No.159/90.  The   admitted  facts  are  that  the respondent  was   initially  appointed   in   a   contingent establishment on  November 20,  1942 and was later appointed on regular  basis as  an Attendant  on February 18, 1945. He tendered voluntary  resignation by letter dated June 6, 1970 which was  accepted by the Government w.e.f. March 19, 1970. As per  the pre-existing  rules, the  Government servant was required to  put in  30  years  of  qualifying  service  for pensionary benefits.  Rules came  to be  amended by  G.O.Ms. No.1537 which  came to  be effective from November 13, 1972. It was stated therein that the Government may, be giving him notice of  not less  than three  months in  writing or three months pay  and allowances  in lieu of such notice, after he has attained  the  age  of  fifty  years  on  after  he  has completed twenty five years of qualifying service retire any Government servant.  Any Government servant who has attained the age  of 50  years or  who  has  completed  25  years  of qualifying service  may also likewise retire from service by giving notice of not less than three months in writing to be appropriate authority.  This rule  has come  into force,  as stated earlier,  w.e.f March  1, 1972.  The  respondent  has voluntarily retired on March 20, 1970 and since then, he has already joined another institution. The view of the Tribunal that he  is entitled  to pension  on completing  25 years of qualifying service  applying the  aforesaid G.O., is clearly illegal. It  cannot be  given retrospective effect. However, since the  respondent had  rendered two  years of  temporary service and  there  is  a  short-fall  of  three  years  for computing the  pension, Government  is  at  liberty  and  is accordingly directed  to consider  his case  whether  he  is eligible  in   accordance  with   appropriate  procedure  to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 pensionary benefits  or relaxation  may be  given  and  pass appropriate orders  within a  period of four months from the date of receipt of the order.

" THE 22ND DAY OF AUGUST, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.M. Punchhi Hon’ble Mrs. Justice Sujata V. Manohar Pramod Swarup, Adv. For the appellants. B.B. Singh. Adv. for the respondents. O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: Jote Singh (dead) by LRs V. Ram Das Mahto and others O R D E R The facts  as found  by the  High Court  are that  at a point of  time, Smt.  Udwantia was  the owner  of the estate left by  her late husband - Thakur Mahto. In the presence of her daughter  Ram Deiya,  she gifted  her property to Ramdas Mahto, her grandson, the son of Ram Deiya. This Ramdas Mahto deprived himself  of the property by effecting two sales and by suffering an auction sale. Ram Deiya filed a suit, out of which this  appeal has  arisen, to  claim  that  her  mother Udwantia being  a limited  owner, could  not have gifted the property to  Ramdas Mahto,  the latter’s  son and, thus, she pleaded for  return of  the properties, by then in the hands of the  transferees and  the auction purchaser, The suit was decreed by the trial court. The first appellate court of the Additional District  Judge confirmed the same. At the second appellate state  before the High Court, the plaintiff - Smt, Ram Deiya  - died  and her  son, Ram  das Mahto,  who was  a defendant in  the suit, succeeded to the estate. It was then that an  argument was  built that  since Ram  Das Mahto  had succeeded to  the property,  any defect  in title  to  those sales stood rectified and omission(s) supplied by the thrust of the  provisions of  Sections 41 and 43 of the Transfer of Property Act  (the Act).  The argument  was accepted  by the High Court  but insofar  as  the  voluntary  transfers  were concerned. In respect of the court sale, in the execution of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 a decree against Ram Das Mahtos such treatment was not meted out. This  has given  rise to  this appeal  by  the  auction purchaser,  clamouring   that  he   was  entitled  to  equal treatment on  the same  interpretation of Sections 41 and 43 of the Act, as put by the High Court. As a  doctrine, it  is well-established  that  where  a person sells  property of  which he  is not the owner but of which he  afterwards becomes  the owner, he is bound to make good the  sale to  the purchaser  out  of  his  subsequently acquired interest.  See in  this connection  Alukmonee Dabee vs. Banee  Madhub Chuckerbutty  and Anr  [ILR-IV Calcutta at 677]. It is equally well-settled that the said doctrine does not apply to a sale when made by or through court because of its very  nature, it  being involuntary  from the sufferer’s angle.  It   is  also   well-understood  that   neither  the provisions of  Section 41  nor that of Section 43 of the Act are available for the benefit of the auction-purchasers, for these provisions  come to  the rescue  of  transferees  from ostensible owners or of transferees who purchase property in good faith  from unauthorised  persons and  who subsequently acquire interest  in the  property  transferred.  These  two provisions logically  get engaged in voluntary transfers and not in  involuntary transfers.  like auction sales. There is no question  of the  court  ever  playing  the  role  of  an ostensible owner  or a  representative owner of the property when selling,  so as to attract the provisions of Section 41 or 43  of the  Act. In  face  of  these  principles,  it  is difficult to  hold that  the High  Court was in error in not giving the  benefit of  the aforesaid  two provisions to the auction purchaser, the appellant herein. The appeal,  therefore has  no merit.  It fails  and is hereby dismissed. No costs.",Ram Das Mahto and others appealed against the High Court decision.

" SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI, J. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave is granted. This appeal is from the final order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No.2368 of 2001 on November 6, 2001.  By the said order a Division Bench of the High Court directed the appellant to deposit 25% of the amount of duty [which is the subject-matter of appeals in respect of twenty two show cause notices pending before the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals), Bombay, the fifth respondent], by way of pre-deposit. The facts, insofar as they are relevant for disposal of this appeal, may be noticed here.  On May 2, 1994, the appellant was issued a show cause notice by the Additional Commissioner of Central Excise, Bombay-III, the third respondent, invoking extended period raising a demand of Rs.4,82,280.11 on various grounds (covering the period from April 1, 1989 to July 31, 1993).  That notice was replied to by the appellant and the matter was pending consideration before the third respondent.   The Superintendent, Central Excise served various notices on the appellant on different dates (they are twenty one in number) raising a total demand of Rs.50,26,029.89 to show cause to the Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Division-X, Bombay.  Six out of the twenty one cases were pending before him after remand.   While so, on March 23, 2001 and March 27, 2001, the case relating to show cause notice dated May 2, 1994 was taken up for consideration by the third respondent who, however, adjudicated the said twenty show cause notices also and confirmed the demand raised in all the twenty two cases by order dated March 30, 2001.  Dissatisfied with the said order, the appellant filed appeal before the fifth respondent herein and also sought waiver of the pre-deposit of the amount in demand.  The fifth respondent ordered that the whole amount of duty, namely, Rs.55,08,310 and penalty of Rs.5,00,000 be deposited within 15 days.  The appellant assailed that order in Writ Petition No.2368 of 2001 before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.  By the impugned order dated November 6, 2001, the High Court reduced the amount of pre-deposit to 25% of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 amount of duty in question in all the appeals.  It is that order of the High Court which is brought under challenge in this appeal. An order declining to grant waiver of pre-deposit or a percentage thereof is a discretionary order and this Court would not ordinarily interfere in such an order.  It is only in the rarest of the rare case, when due to improper exercise of discretion, the interests of justice get defeated that this Court would grant appropriate relief.  From the facts stated above, it is evident that though the case under consideration of the third respondent was in respect of show cause notice dated May 2, 1994, in the final order he, however, proceeded to confirm the demand which was the subject-matter of all the twenty two show cause notices.  In such  a  case,  the  amount   in  question  in  all  the  twenty  two appeals should not be the basis to counter the question of pre- deposit.  In our view, a sum of Rs.4,82,280.11 deposited by the appellant pursuant to the interlocutory order of this Court dated January 25, 2001and which represented the amount in demand pursuant to show case notice dated May 2, 1994, would be sufficient compliance of requirement of pre-deposit in the bunch of appeals and would also meet the ends of justice.  The impugned order of the High Court varying the order of the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals), Bombay, is accordingly modified.  The fifth respondent is directed to dispose of the appeals in accordance with law uninfluenced by any observations made by this Court in this order.  The appeal is accordingly allowed.  No costs.","This appeal is from the final order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No.2368 of 2001 on November 6, 2001.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard counsel  on both  sides. This appeal,  by special  leave, arises from the judgment of the High Court of Delhi, dated December 7, 1995 made in C.R. No.974/90. It is  not necessary to narrate all the details for the purpose of disposal of this appeal. Suffice it to state that the respondent  had a perpetual lease in 1937 and ever since he has  been using  the premises  for running  a hotel.  The respondent filed  a suit in 1991 for the first time alleging that  the   appellant  had   violated  clause  7(2)  of  the conditions of  lease as  he  has  been  obtained  the  prior permission of  the Commissioner.  Ad-interim injunction  was granted. When he sought for vacation, it was not ordered. On appeal, it  was confirmed  and revision  was dismissed. Thus this appeal, by special leave. It is  an indisputable  fact that  ever since  1937 the appellant  has   been  using  the  premises  for  commercial purpose, viz.,  running a  hotel business.  It is not a case where the balance of convenience would lie if prohibition on running the  hotel on  the basis  of the lease is granted to him. Whether  the appellant  has violated  the conditions of the lease is a matter to be gone into in the suit itself. We decline to go into the merits though Shri Gopal Subramaniam, learned senior  counsel, sought  to impress upon us the non- compliance of the covenants of the lease. He also brought to our notice  the conduct  on the part of the appellant in not obeying the ex-parte order of injunction granted on December 2, 1991  till September  24, 1994. It may be that he did not obey the injunction but remedy is different. On that ground, it cannot  be said that balance of convenience lies in grant of  injunction   in  favour   of  the  respondent.  Granting injunction  is   a  matter   of  discretionary.  Balance  of convenience and  irremediable injury  are triable issues and are required  to be  examined and  found positively. All are apparently lacking. Since the appellant has been running the business right  from 1937,  balance of  convenience does not lie in  issuing the  ad-interim injunction  and he cannot be adequately compensated  if ultimately  succeeds in  the suit for  prohibiting  the  running  of  the  business  which  he http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 acquired a  goodwill for  using the  premises from  long  60 years.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  courts  below  have committed gross error of law in granting injunction. The appeal is accordingly allowed. Ad-interim injuction stands dissolved.  The trial Court is directed to dispose of the suit as expeditiously as possible. No costs.","This appeal,  by special leave, arises from the judgment of the High Court of Delhi, dated December 7, 1995 made in C.R. No.974/90.

" ORDER 1.The only question of law that arises for  consideration in  this appeal is whether the mortgage deed was  proved  in accordance with law in absence of examination of any of  the attesting witnesses. 2.The High Court held that since the appellant, who was a guarantor,  having  admitted his signature on  the  mortgage deed  and he having not Specifically denied in  the  written statement the execution of the document it was not necessary for  the  respondent-plaintiff  to  examine  any   attesting witness to prove the execution of the mortgage deed. 3.In  Kunwar  Surendra  Bahadur Singh  v.  Thakur  Behari Singh’,  it  has  been held that one of  the  essentials  of mortgage  deed is that each of the attesting witnesses  must have  signed the document in the presence of the  executant. The Court held that if the provisions of Sections 58 and  59 of  the  Registration  Act  and Sections 3  and  59  of  the Transfer  of  Property Act are read together, there  was  no escape from the conclusion that a mortgage deed was required to  be  proved by producing ;it least one of  the  attesting witnesses.   In  view of this decision the judgment  of  the High  Court cannot be upheld.  The observation of  the  High Court that there was no specific denial by the appellant  in his written statement also does not appear to be correct  as the appellant in paragraph 11 clearly stated that he did not admit  the  document  dated 22-4-1958.   There  was  thus  a specific denial and as held by the Privy Council in  absence of  production of any attesting witness the  document  could not be deemed to have been proved in accordance with law. 4.In  the  result, this appeal succeeds and  is  allowed. The  order  and  decree  of the  courts  below  against  the appellant-guarantor  is set aside and the suit  against  him shall  stand  dismissed.

" O R D E R Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  [for short, the ""Act""] initially was published on May 25, 1956 acquiring a huge extent of 985.95 acres of land for industrial  purpose in  Durgapur. It  would appear  that subsequently the  notification got lapsed. Consequently, the second notification came to be published on August 10, 1964. The Land  Acquisition Officer  determined the compensation @ Rs.2,310/- per acre. In this case, we are concerned with the extent of  the lands  in 5 plots Sri in survey Nos.710, 735, 762, 824  and 912 of an extent of 0.33, 0.11, 0.63, 0.13 and 0.49 acres  respectively. The  reference Court  enhanced the compensation   Rs.1,45,000/- per acre relying upon Ext. 1(d) dated April  24, 1964.  It is  settled law  that the similar lands were  of large  extent involved for acquisition and or evidence relied  upon, even  the High  Court has doubted the genuineness of  this document.  It is  scated by the learned counsel for  the appellant  that this  document came  to  be executed  between   the  parties  who  are  claiming  higher compensation. It  would be  obvious  that  after  the  first notification was  issued and  before the second notification came  to   be  published  this  document  was  brought  into existence  to   inflate  the   market  value.   Under  these circumstances, the  High Court  in  another  case  was  well justified in  doubting the correctness of it. Unfortunately, except that  document, there  is  no    other  evidence  for enhancement of  the compensation.  But in  view of  the fact that large  extent of  the lands  are involved and we do not have the  advantage of any other evidence or assistance from respondents, we are not inclined to confirm the award of the Collector. under these circumstances, we set aside the award or the  Court and the High Court and remit the matter to the reference Court  to decide  the compensation  afresh on  the basis of  the evidence vis-a-vis any other reference pending before  it  having  similar  facts  and  decide  the  matter according to law. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed,  but,  in  the circumstances, without costs.","Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [for short, the ""Act""] initially was published on May 25, 1956 acquiring a huge extent of 985.95 acres of land for industrial purpose in Durgapur.

" WITH SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION [C] NO. 19030 OF 1996 [CC - 4204/96] O R D E R These Special  Leave Petitions  have been filed against the orders  passed in  W.P. No.5196/89 on March 12, 1990 and W.P. No.1552/96  on April  26, 1996.  There is absolutely no merit for  condonation  of  delay  in  the  the  first  writ petition. As regards the second writ petition, the facts are not in dispute. Way back in 1974, notification under Section 126(4) of  the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act [""MRTP Act"", for short] was issued after the approval of the Scheme by  the   State  Government,  for  acquiring  the  land  for utilisation thereof for the stated Scheme. Pursuant thereto, an award  came to  be passed by the Land Acquisition Officer under Section  11 of  the Land  Acquisition Act,  1894  (for short, the ""Act"") on November 11, 1977. Possession was taken earlier on  October 21,  1974. After  the utilisation of the land, surplus  land was  sought to  be used for allotment to some of  the Councilors  and the  employees of  the Kolhapur Municipality. Consequently,  the first writ petition came to be filed  which was  dismissed on  merits on March 12, 1990. Thereafter, the  petitioners filed  a suit  challenging  the acquisition and suit came to be dismissed as withdrawn being not maintainable.  Writ Petition  No.  1552/96  came  to  be filed. That  writ petition  was also dismissed on the ground that the  earlier order in the writ petition operated as res judicate. Therefore, the second writ petition was held to be not maintainable. Shri Naik,  learned senior  counsel appearing  for  the petitioners, contended that in the second writ petition, the petitioner sought  restitution of the possession pursuant to the Resolution  of the  State Government  dated October  10, 1973 under  which Government  directed that the surplus land was to be utilised first for any other public purpose and in the alternative  it was  to be  given back  to the erstwhile owners.  Since   he  had  sought  enforcement  of  the  said Government  Resolution,  the  writ  petition  could  not  be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 dismissed on  the ground  of constructive  res judicate.  He also seeks  to rely  upon certain  orders said  to have been passed by  the High  Court in conformity with enforcement of the Government  Resolution. We  do not think that this Court would be  justified in  making direction  for restitution of the land to the erstwhile owners when the land was taken way back  and   vested  in   the  Municipality   free  from  all encumbrances. We  are not concerned with the validity of the notification  in   either  of  the  writ  petitions.  It  is axiomatic that  the land acquired for a public purpose would be utilised for any another public purpose, though use of it was intended  for the  original public  purpose. It  is  not intended that  any land  which remain  unutilised, should be restituted  to   the  erstwhile   owner  to   whom  adequate compensation was  paid according  to the  market value as on the date of the notification. Under these circumstances, the High Court was well justified in refusing to grant relief in both the writ petitions. The special leave petitions are dismissed.","Special Leave Petitions have been filed against the orders passed in W.P. No.5196/89 on March 12, 1990.

A compromise application was filed before the trial court by plaintiff- S.Jayanth and S.Ratna and in lieu thereof a compromise decree was passed on 30.9.2004. During the pendency of the suit, respondent No. 1 had filed an application under Order 1  Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure  being Misc. Application No. 8 of 2002 in the Original Suit for impleading him as a party defendant to the proceedings. The said application was rejected by the trial court by its order dated 3.3.2004. Respondent No. 1, instead of filing an appeal against the order of refusal to implead him as a party, preferred a first appeal under Section 96 of C.P.C. before the High Court challenging the compromise decree passed by the trial court on 30.9.2004.  When the matter came up  before the       High Court, a memo is alleged to have been filed by the respondents in the appeal namely; S. Jayanth and S. Ratna stating that they had no objection to set aside the compromise decree dated 30.9.2004  and to implead  respondent No. 1  as defendant in Original Suit No. 350 of 1993. Acting on that memo, the High Court by impugned order dated 9.8.2006 set aside the compromise decree without going into the merits or demerits of the case and remanded the matter to the trial court to proceed with the suit on merits after impleading respondent No. 1 as party to the suit.  Aggrieved by the said order of the High Court, the present appeal has been  filed. 4.           It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the appeal filed by the stranger to the proceedings without he being impleaded as a party was not maintainable   at  all.  Apart from this, the compromise decree dated 30.9.2004 between the parties, i.e. the appellant and  respondent No. 2 could not have been set aside only on the request made by one opposite party when the other opposite party had not made  such a request for se tting aside  the compromise decree.  It is well settled that the compromise decree can be set aside only on the joint prayer of the parties to the compromise and not on the basis of assertion or request to that effect by one of the parties.  In pursuance of our order dated 15.1.2008, the appellant has produced before us the Memo of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Consent filed before the High Court.   From that Memo also, it is clear that the Memo was filed and signed by respondent No. 2 herein S. Jayanth (respondent No. 1  in the appeal before the High Court) and not by the appellant S.

We have  heard counsel  on both sides. These appeals by special leave  arise from  the  orders  of  the  M.P.  Admn. Tribunal, Indore  Bench made  in T.A. Nos.3536/83 & batch on October  23,   1993.  The   admitted  facts   are  that  the respondents, while  in service  as Assistant  Teachers, were deputed at  the Government  expenses  for  obtaining  higher qualification of  graduation etc. and in some case, for B.Ed degree. They  were deputed  in the  year 1966 but on October 20, 1964 that candidates may go at their own cost or deputed by Court  and that  the Government  had decided. Such of the employees who had gone on training at Government expenses to improve their  qualification were  held ineligible  for  two advance increments  and who  had gone at their own expenses, were made  eligible for two advance increments. It is not in dispute that  the respondents  had gone  for training at the Government expenses  to improve  their  qualifications.  The Tribunal held that imposition of the cut-off date of October 22, 1964  is bad  in law.  We find  that  the  view  of  the Tribunal is  not correct.  It is  seen, that  the Government have taken decision on the said date to allow the benefit of option to  the candidates  to go  on training  for improving their qualifications  either at  their own  cost or  at  the expenses  of   the  Government.  Since  on  that  date,  the Government half  taken the  decision, the given cut-off date is perfectly  valid in  law and no fault can he found. It is then contended  that  since  the  respondents  had  gone  on training to  improve they  qualifications, they are eligible for two advance increments. It is seen that the order is explicit as under: ""As per  Finance Department’s  Memo http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 No.   16333-CR-1892-I   VRI   dated 22.10.64 the advance increments are to  be   allowed  only   to   those government   servants    who   have received  training   et  their  own costs   and   Government   servants deputed for  training at Government expenses  are   excluded  from  the grant of  advance increments. These orders   have    not   been   given retrospective effect  but they come into force  from the  date of issue of orders.  Accordingly anyone  who proceeded for training upto 22.10.4 whether   at   his   cost   or   at government cost,  will be  eligible to  the   concession.   Those   who proceeded on  training on  or after 23.10.64  can  get  the  concession only if  the training is at his own cost and  not at  the cost  of  the government."" A reading  thereof would  clearly indicate that such of those in  service who  had gone on training to improve their qualifications at  the Government  expenses,  would  not  be eligible for two advance increments while those who had gone on training at their own expenses, would be eligible for two advance increments within the stipulated period mentioned in the order.  It would be obvious that they had the benefit of pay and  expenses. Consequently,  they were  denied  advance increments. Under these circumstances, we hold that the view of the Tribunal is clearly unsustainable in law. The  appeals   are  accordingly  allowed.  T.As.  stand dismissed. No costs.","The appeals by special leave arise from the orders of the M.P. Tribunal, Indore. The Tribunal held that imposition of the cut-off date of October 22, 1964 is bad  in law.

" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ORIGINAL JURISDICTION  . Writ  Petition (Criminal)  No. 7444 1981. 140 (Under article 32 of the Constitution of India) Hajinder Singh for the Petitioner. O.P. Sharma  M.S.  Dhillon  and  R.N.  Poddar  for  the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by: KOSHAL J.  In  this  petition  under  Art.  32  of  the Constitution of  India seeking  the issuance  of a  writ  of habeas corpus, the prayer made by the petitioner is that his brother, Narinder  Singh, who has been detained in pursuance of an  order dated  4th November, 1980 passed under sub-sec. (I) of  sec. 3  of the  Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of  Smuggling Activities  Act, 1974  be  released from custody.  The main  ground  urged  in  support  of  the petition is  that there  is no  nexus between  the  unlawful activities attributed  to the  detenu and his incarceration. That ground  we do  not find to be without substance. A case covering offences  under sections  307, 411  and 414  of the Indian Penal  Code, amongst  others, was  registered against the detenu  at Police Station Lopoke in Amritsar district on 27th February,  1980 and  those offences  are the  only acts which form  the basis  of the  impugned order Those acts are also the  subject-matter of  a prosecution  launched against the detenu, proceedings in relation to which have been going on in  the Court  of an  Amritsar Magistrate.  During  those proceedings the  detenu was  on bail  and was  appearing  in court on  every hearing  right from  January 2, 1981 till he was put  behind the  bars on 10th July, 1981 in pursuance of the impugned  order. We  are clearly  of  the  opinion  that offences which are said to have been committed by the detenu as far  back as  27th February,  1980 could  hardly  form  a ground for  his detention  on a  date as  late as 10th July, 1981, the  gap between  the two being well-nigh a year and a half. No  explanation at all has been furnished on behalf of the State  as to  why action  under the Act was not taken at the earliest  possible after  the alleged  commission of the offences  which  are  the  foundation  of  the  grounds  for detention. In  our  opinion,  the  charge  is  so  stale  in relation to the detention as not to have any real connection with it.  It is  further noteworthy that no reason is put 11 forward for  the  detenu  not  being  taken  in  custody  in pursuance of  the impugned  order (for  which the  detaining authority was  moved in  the first  instance by  the  Senior Superintendent of Police, Amritsar) 141 right form  January 2,  1981 till  July 10, 1981 although he appeared in  Court on  all the dates of hearing fixed by the Magistrate during  that period.  In these  circumstances the detention  takes  the  character  of  punitive  rather  than preventive action  and is therefore vitiated. Accordingly we strike down the impugned order and direct that the detenu be released from custody forthwith. N.V.K.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (CRL.) No.4590 of 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this Appeal is to the order of a learned Single Judge of the Guwahati High Court dismissing the Criminal Revision filed by the appellant. The background facts in a nutshell are as follows: The appellant was convicted for an offence punishable under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’) by learned sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Jonai. The allegation against the appellant was that he had mis- appropriated a sum of Rs.91,006/-. While taking over charge as Deputy Inspector of Schools on 12.11.1991, he had received cash amounting to Rs.91,796/-, as per the accounts maintained. When the cash was physically verified only Rs.790/-was found, and it was, therefore, inferred that he had committed misappropriation of cash.  He faced trial for alleged commission of offence punishable under Section 409 IPC. Questioning his conviction and sentence of two years with fine as imposed by the trial Court, an appeal was filed before the Sessions Court. Learned Sessions Judge, Dhemaji dismissed the Criminal appeal upholding the conviction and the sentence imposed. A Criminal Revision in terms of Section 397  read with Section 401 and Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Cr.P.C.’) was filed.  When the matter was taken up on 12.5.2006, none appeared for the petitioner. Therefore, learned Single Judge dismissed the revision petition after hearing learned counsel for the State. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that learned counsel who was appearing for the appellant in the High Court had been appointed as a counsel for the State and, therefore, could not have appeared for the appellant.  Unfortunately, this position was not brought to the notice of the appellant and, therefore, the appellant should not be made to suffer.  It is pointed out that the appellant has always pursued the remedies and there was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 never any negligence on his part. In response, learned counsel for the State submitted that though the appellant had not been represented by a counsel, learned Single Judge elaborately dealt with the factual and legal position after hearing learned counsel for the State and perusing the records. It has not been disputed that the learned counsel who was appearing for the appellant in the Criminal Revision had been appointed as a counsel for the State and could not have appeared for the appellant.  There is also no material to show that the appellant after having knowledge of such appointment of his counsel failed to appoint another lawyer to conduct the case before the High Court. In view of this peculiar circumstances, it would be in the interest of justice to set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh hearing.  To avoid unnecessary delay, we direct that the matter shall be listed before an appropriate Bench on 11.12.2006 and learned Chief Justice of the High Court shall pass necessary orders in that regard. It is undertaken by learned counsel for the appellant that another counsel shall be engaged to appear for the appellant before the High Court before the aforesaid date. Since the matter was pending before the High Court for nearly seven years, we request the High Court to explore the possibility of disposal of the Criminal Revision as early as practicable. Learned counsel for the appellant stated that an application for bail shall be filed before the High Court. Needless to say that if such application is filed, the same shall be dealt with in accordance with law. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. 28268","Appeal is to the order of a learned Single Judge of the Guwahati High Court dismissing the Criminal Revision filed by the appellant.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL LNO.959 OF 2008 [Arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.5334 of 2006] Leave granted. Management/State is in appeal before us. On 08th October 1993, respondent no.1 herein was appointed by respondent no.2 (Chairman-cum-Collector, Kendrapara Municipality) as Assistant Teacher on ad-hoc basis on a consolidated salary of Rs.500/- per month for a period of 44 days.  Her ad-hoc appointment was extended from time to time.  However, while extending the ad-hoc appointment, break of one day was given on completion of each 44 days. On 31st July 1995, respondent nos.2 and 3 regularised services of 8 primary school teachers working in different schools within the Kendrapara Municipal Area. On 19th August 1995, the appellant issued an order that the appointment to the post of primary school teachers will be made by the respective District Inspectors of Schools through a Selection Committee constituted for the purpose.  Pursuant to the said order the services of respondent no.1 were not extended as the Municipality had no authority to do so. C.A.No.959/08 .... (contd.) - 2 - Respondent no.1 filed a writ petition before the High Court seeking regularisation o f her services and payment of salary and other allowances as were being paid to other similarly situated teachers. The appellant does not appear to have been made a party before the High Court originally, but, was impleaded as a party. A Division Bench of the High Court allowed the writ petition and directed that the services of respondent no.1 be regularised with effect from the date from which the services of 8 other similarly situated teachers were regularised.  Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant is in appeal before us. During the course of the proceedings in this Court, counsel for the appellant submit ted that the services of respondent no.1 had been dispensed with from 01st November 1995 whereas the case of respondent no.1 was that she was still continuing in service.  State Government had constituted a Committee to enquire whether respondent no.1 was still working.  Counsel for the appellant was directed to place on record a copy of the said report.  The report has been filed by the appellant.  As per this report, engagement of respondent no.1 on ad-hoc basis was extended from time to time till November 1995 and no salary was being paid to her thereafter.  The said Committee has also found that the Teachers Attendance Register of the teaching staff of the school did not find the name of respondent no.1.  The only evidence produced by respondent no.1 was a Teachers Attendance Register being maintained by herself since June 1997. C.A.No.959/08 .... (contd.) - 3 - http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 After hearing counsel for the parties and going through the report of the Committee, we are satisfied that services of respondent no.1 were dispensed with in the month of November 1995 and thereafter she has not worked. Apart from this, the impugned order of the High Court is apparently contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Umadevi & Ors. (2006) 4 SCC 1.  In the said judgment, this Court held that a person who is appointed on temporary, contractual, casual or daily wage basis has no right to seek regularisation as he was not appointed in terms of the relevant rules or in adherence of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.    As the judgment in appeal runs counter to the said decision of this Court, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and dismiss the writ petition filed before it.  Consequently, the appeal stands allowed. It is made clear that in case there are any arrears due to respondent no.1 upto 31st October 1995, the same be disbursed to her within a period of four weeks from today.","In 1993, respondent no.1 was appointed by Kendrapara Municipality as Assistant Teacher on ad-hoc basis on a consolidated salary of Rs.500/- per month for a period of 44 days.

" THE 22ND DAY OF AUGUST, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.M. Punchhi Hon’ble Mrs. Justice Sujata V. Manohar Pramod Swarup, Adv. For the appellants. B.B. Singh. Adv. for the respondents. O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: Jote Singh (dead) by LRs V. Ram Das Mahto and others O R D E R The facts  as found  by the  High Court  are that  at a point of  time, Smt.  Udwantia was  the owner  of the estate left by  her late husband - Thakur Mahto. In the presence of her daughter  Ram Deiya,  she gifted  her property to Ramdas Mahto, her grandson, the son of Ram Deiya. This Ramdas Mahto deprived himself  of the property by effecting two sales and by suffering an auction sale. Ram Deiya filed a suit, out of which this  appeal has  arisen, to  claim  that  her  mother Udwantia being  a limited  owner, could  not have gifted the property to  Ramdas Mahto,  the latter’s  son and, thus, she pleaded for  return of  the properties, by then in the hands of the  transferees and  the auction purchaser, The suit was decreed by the trial court. The first appellate court of the Additional District  Judge confirmed the same. At the second appellate state  before the High Court, the plaintiff - Smt, Ram Deiya  - died  and her  son, Ram  das Mahto,  who was  a defendant in  the suit, succeeded to the estate. It was then that an  argument was  built that  since Ram  Das Mahto  had succeeded to  the property,  any defect  in title  to  those sales stood rectified and omission(s) supplied by the thrust of the  provisions of  Sections 41 and 43 of the Transfer of Property Act  (the Act).  The argument  was accepted  by the High Court  but insofar  as  the  voluntary  transfers  were concerned. In respect of the court sale, in the execution of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 a decree against Ram Das Mahtos such treatment was not meted out. This  has given  rise to  this appeal  by  the  auction purchaser,  clamouring   that  he   was  entitled  to  equal treatment on  the same  interpretation of Sections 41 and 43 of the Act, as put by the High Court. As a  doctrine, it  is well-established  that  where  a person sells  property of  which he  is not the owner but of which he  afterwards becomes  the owner, he is bound to make good the  sale to  the purchaser  out  of  his  subsequently acquired interest.  See in  this connection  Alukmonee Dabee vs. Banee  Madhub Chuckerbutty  and Anr  [ILR-IV Calcutta at 677]. It is equally well-settled that the said doctrine does not apply to a sale when made by or through court because of its very  nature, it  being involuntary  from the sufferer’s angle.  It   is  also   well-understood  that   neither  the provisions of  Section 41  nor that of Section 43 of the Act are available for the benefit of the auction-purchasers, for these provisions  come to  the rescue  of  transferees  from ostensible owners or of transferees who purchase property in good faith  from unauthorised  persons and  who subsequently acquire interest  in the  property  transferred.  These  two provisions logically  get engaged in voluntary transfers and not in  involuntary transfers.  like auction sales. There is no question  of the  court  ever  playing  the  role  of  an ostensible owner  or a  representative owner of the property when selling,  so as to attract the provisions of Section 41 or 43  of the  Act. In  face  of  these  principles,  it  is difficult to  hold that  the High  Court was in error in not giving the  benefit of  the aforesaid  two provisions to the auction purchaser, the appellant herein. The appeal,  therefore has  no merit.  It fails  and is hereby dismissed. No costs.",Ram Das Mahto and others appealed against the High Court decision. The appeal was dismissed on the grounds that the transfer of property was voluntary and not an involuntary sale. The High Court held that the sale was made by or through court.,transfer,33.4

" L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J O  R  D E R Leave granted.  Heard the learned  counsel for  the  parties.  The High Court by the impugned  judgment and  order  dated 7.4.2000 has quashed the  detention  order dated 16.10.1999 on the ground that there is non-application of  mind  on  the part of the detaining  authority  and  has mechanically  signed  the same because it is stated  in  the detention   order   that   it    be   served   through   the Superintendent,  Central Prison, Thiruchirapalli which would mean  that the detaining authority was not aware of the fact that  the detenu was released on bail.  The learned  counsel for   the   appellants  submitted   that  there   is   total non-application  of mind by the High Court to the  detention order.   Detention order specifically mentions in the ground No.6  that  he  was aware that detenu has been  released  on conditional  bail by order dated 17.9.1999 in Cr.  M.P.  No. 2138  of 1999 by the Judicial Magistrate-II, Mayiladuthurai. In  this set of circumstances, it cannot be said that  there is non-application of mind by the detaining authority merely by  mentioning  that  detention   order  be  served  through Superintendent,  Central  Prison, Thiruchirapalli.   In  our view,  it  appears  that  the   learned  Judge  has  lightly interfered  with the detention order without reading  ground No.6  which specifically recites that detenu was released on bail  by  order  dated  17th September  1999.   Further  the detention  order  is addressed to the detenu mentioning  his residential  address.   Therefore, there was no question  of serving  the detention order through Superintendent, Central Prison.   By  sending  copy to the  Superintendent,  Central Prison  would not make the detention order illegal.   Hence, the  impugned order passed by the High Court requires to  be quashed  and  set  aside  and  is  accordingly,  set  aside. Learned  counsel for the appellant submitted that the detenu should  be  ordered  to surrender to undergo  the  remaining period  of detention.  For this purpose, he placed  reliance on  the  directions issued by this Court in  Sunil  Fulchand Shah  v.  Union of India & Ors.  [(2000) 3 SCC 409] which is reproduced  hereunder:   - 6.  The quashing of an order  of detention  by the High Court brings to an end such an  order and  if  an appeal is allowed against the order of the  High Court, the question whether or not the detenu should be made http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to  surrender to undergo the remaining period of  detention, would  depend upon a variety of factors and in particular on the question of lapse of time between the date of detention, the  order  of the High Court, and the order of this  Court, setting aside the order of the High Court. A  detenu  need  not  be  sent  back  to  undergo  the remaining  period of detention, after a long lapse of  time, when  even  the  maximum prescribed period intended  in  the order  of detention has expired, unless there still exists a proximate  temporal  nexus between the period  of  detention indicated  in the order by which the detenu was required  to be  detained and the date when the detenu is required to  be detained  pursuant  to the appellate order and the State  is able  to  satisfy  the  court   about  the  desirability  of further or continued detention. Applying the aforesaid ratio, in our view, this is not a  fit case for directing the detenu to surrender to undergo the  remaining  period  of detention.  Detention  order  was passed  on 6th October, 1999 and hence, detention period  is over.  In the result, the appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.",The High Court by the impugned judgment and order  dated 7.4.2000 has quashed the detention  order dated 16.10.1999 on the ground that there is non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority. The detention order specifically mentions in the ground No.6 that he  was aware that detenu has been  released  on conditional  bail by order dated 17.9.1999 in Cr.  M.P. 2138 of 1999.,appointment,23.46
" WITH CIVIL APPEAL WITH NO. 9865 OF 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 14996/93) O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. We requested  Shri C.S.  Vaidyanathan,  learned  senior counsel to assist the appellant. We have heard the arguments for the  State and  also Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan. The Tribunal in the  impugned order,  while setting  aside the  order  of compulsory retirement  from service,  remitted the matter to the Government  to conduct  the enquiry  afresh after giving opportunity to  the appellant  and  based  thereon  to  pass appropriate orders  for fixation  of the  pension etc. It is not in  dispute that  the appellant has already retired from service. It  is also  not in dispute that the advances drawn for construction  of the house allotment of the house in the name of  his wife  by Housing Board has already been redone. Consequently, there  is no  detriment caused  to the  State. Since he  had already retired from service, we think, on the facts and  circumstances of  the case,  it is not a case for conducting a  fresh enquiry as directed by the Tribunal. The order of  the Tribunal  is  set  aside.  The  Government  is directed to  consider his case fur promotion on par with the juniors who  were promoted  pending enquiry,  and then grant him promotion if he is found eligible with all consequential reliefs. The  Government will  also redetermine his notional scale of  pay on the promotional post and pay the arrears of salary and  also pension as if he had retired on promotional post. This  action should be taken and payment made within a period of  six weeks  from the  date of  the receipt  of  is order. The appeals are accordingly allowed.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 11 89 of 1982. From the  Judgment and  order dated  the 18th December, 1981 of the Gauhati High Court in Election Petition No. 1 of 1980. S  Rangarajan,   S.K.  Nandy  and  S.  Parikh  for  the Appellant. A.K Nag for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI,  J. In  this election  appeal the only point for determination is whether at the time when respondent No. I filed  his nomination  paper he held a subsisting contract with the  Government for widening the PLP road.. While it is true that  there was  such a  contract in existence prior to 30:11.1979, respondent No. 1 wrote a 864 letter on  30.11.1979 to  the concerned  Executive  Engineer stating that he was closing the said contract. The last date for filing  nomination was 10.12.1979. It is argued that the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 contents of  the said  letter does  not have  the effect  of putting an  end to  the contract.  After going  through  the contents of  the letter  it is  absolutely  clear  that  the contractor unilaterally  put an  end  to  the  contract  and informed the  Department concerned  accordingly and  also he had resigned from the contractor’s list of PWD Manipur. Thus after this  letter the contract came to an end by breach and the contract  was no  longer subsisting.  Mr. Rangarajan has submitted  some   very  nice   and  delicate  questions  for consideration. One  of them-being  that until and unless the letter is  accepted by  the  Authority  the  contract  would continue and  thus the  respondent  would  suffer  from  the disqualification.  In  our  opinion  having  regard  to  the contents of  the letter  it is  not possible  to accept  the argument of Mr. Rangarajan that the contract was subsisting. The  acceptance   of  the  letter  by  the  authorities  was unnecessary for  putting an end to the contract although the breach may  give rise  to a  cause on action for damages. No other point is raised before us. We do not find any merit in this appeal  and it  is dismissed  without any  order as  to costs. H.L. C.

The appellant has been convicted by  the  Designated Court,  Sangrur,  in  Special  Sessions  Case No. 75 of 1992 (Sessions Trial No. 265 of 1994) under  Section  25  of  the Arms  Act  and  Section  5  of  the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. 1987. He has filed this  appeal Challenging  his  conviction  and  order  of sentence passed against him. What is held proved by the Designated Court  against the appellant is that he was found in possession of a Double Barrel Gun  bearing  No.    294  without a permit/licence to possess the  same.    The  Designated  Court  believed   the evidence of  Head  Constable Mall Singh (P.W.  2) and A.S.I. Baldev Singh (P.W.  3) both of whom were the members of  the police  party  which  had  intercepted the appellant and had found the appellant in possession of the  said  gun.    They have  stated  in  their evidence that the gun was in working condition.  It was that type of gun in which gun  powder  is required  to  be  filled  in first before it could be fired. They were not cross-examined as regards working condition of the gun. What is contended by the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant  is  that  as  the  identity  of  the  gun was not established and no evidence of an expert was  led  to  prove that  it  was  in working condition by test firing the same, the appellant ought not  to  have  been  convicted  for  the offences alleged  against  him.  In our opinion, there is no substance in this contention because the type of  gun  which was  found  from the appellant was ’Mujhal or ’Toredar’ gun. As we have pointed out earlier this type of gun can be fired by first filling it with gun powder.  In respect of  such  a weapon no further test firing was necessary in order to find out whether  it  was in a working condition or not.  Once it was found by the Police Officer that the  mechanism  was  in order.   It  could  be  reasonable  inferred  that it was in working condition.    Therefore,  even  in  absence  of  any evidence  of  an armourer or an expert of that type evidence of a Police Officer who is trained in handling guns  can  be accepted.   We,  therefore, confirm the conviction and order http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of sentence passed against him.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2. The Government of India in O.M.No. 18(4)-EV/79 dated  May 25,  1979  introduced in paragraph 3(iii) that half  of  the dearness  pay  was  treated as  pay  to  compute  retirement benefits.   That came to be challenged by the respondent  in filing  O.A.  before the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal, Hyderabad.  The Tribunal in the impugned order dated  August 9,  1989  following  a judgment of  the  Bangalore  Tribunal declared  it to be ultra vires, offending Article 14 of  the Constitution.  Thus this appeal by special leave. 3.  The benefit of the O.M. is to facilitate calculation  of 10 months’ average pay for the purpose of pension.  Earlier, only  3/10th of the 10 months average pay was  computed  for pension.   Under  the impugned order in para 3(iii)  of  the O.M.  dated  May 25, 1979, the computation would  be  5/10th i.e. half of the dearness pay for the purpose of computation of pension. In other words, the O.M. is more beneficial  for the pensioner rather than earlier computation.  Whether  the notification  is justified and valid in law, was  considered by  a  Bench  of this Court in State of  Rajasthan  v.  Seva Nivatra Karamchari Hitkari Samiti, 1995(1) SCALE 40  wherein it  was held that the ratio in Nakara’s case has no  bearing in  this  matter  and the introduction of the  rule  is  not arbitrary or 540 capricious.   It  is  permissible  to  introduce   different retiral benefit schemes for Government servants as indicated in  the  decisions held by this Court in  Krishan  Kumar  v. Union of India, (1994)4 SCC 207, Indian Ex-Service League v. Union of India, AIR 1991 SC II 82, and State of Rajasthan v. Rajasthan Pensioner Samaj, AIR 1991 SC  1743. 4.   In view of the above ratio and practical effect of  the O.M.,  we  are  of the opinion that there  is  no  invidious discrimination  in the classification of the pensioners  who http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 retired at different dates and in computation of the pension for  different  periods.  The Government’s O.M.  makes  dis- cernible difference between government employees retired  at different  dates for entitlement to pension.  In  fact,  the O.M.  is more beneficial to the retired employees  than  was contended in the petition. S.   Under the circumstances, the Tribunal was not right  in following  the earlier decision of the another  Tribunal  at Bangalore  accepting  the  ratio in  Nakara’s  case  without testing  the  facts  and circumstances of  this  case.

" O R D E R The respondent  instituted Title  Suit No.6 of 1974 for eviction of the appellant on ground of default in payment of rent. That suit was dismissed on 31.1.1978. The first appeal preferred  by  the  respondent  before  the  District  Judge succeeded vide  judgment  and  order  dated  31.3.1979.  The appellant filed  second appeal  in  the  High  Court,  being Second Appeal  No. 404  of 1979. During the pendency of that appeal, landlord  - respondent  filed an  application  under Section 15  of the  Bihar Building  Control Act (hereinafter the Act)  for deposit  of arrears of rent accumulated during pendency of  the appeal  and future rent during the pendency of the appeal. An order came to be made by the High Court on 25.9.1979 to  deposit the arrears of rent by 15.11.1979. The appellant,  however,   deposited  the  arrears  of  rent  on 9.2.1980 and  that amount  was subsequently withdrawn by the respondent -  landlord. While  the second appeal was pending in the  High Court, the respondent instituted Title Suit No. 100 of  1980 seeking eviction of the appellant on the ground that during  the pendency  of the  appeal in  the High Court arising out  of the  earlier suit,  the  appellant  had  not complied with the direction of the High Court to deposit the rent mad  eon 25.9.1979, in the application under Section 15 of the  Act within  the prescribed  time  and  was  thus  in default in payment to arrears of rent and, therefore, liable to be  evicted. The  appellant contested the suit and in his written  statement  inter-alia  raised  the  plea  that  the default in the deposit of rent pursuant to the orders passed by the High Court in the application under Section 15 of the Act within  the prescribed  period could not be a ground for his eviction.  It was also averred that since the respondent had withdrawn  the rent  amount, we  had waived her right to complain about  the delayed deposit of rent. The trial court decreed title  suit No.  100 of 1980 on 29.3.1985. An appeal filed  by  the  appellant  before  the  District  Judge  was dismissed on  10.5.1990. His second appeal failed before the High Court on 6.2.1991. Hence this appeal by special leave. We have  heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the  records. The consequence of non-compliance with a direction made under Section 15 of the Act is contained in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Section 15(1)  of the Act. The court could order the defence against ejectment  to be  struck off and to place the tenant in the  same position as if he had not defended the claim to ejectment in  the matter or cause in which the direction was made. For  non-compliance of  the direction  in  the  second appeal, recourse could not be had to seeking ejectment under Section 11  of the Act. Delay in the deposit of trend is not covered by  Section 11  of the  Act, particularly  after the rent was  withdrawn without demur by the landlord. The trial court, the  first appellate court and the High Court fell in error in  not noticing  the distinction between the remedies available under  Section 11  of the  Act and those available for non-compliance  with the  directions under Section 15 of the Act.  The courts  below ought to have held that the suit for eviction  was not maintainable on the ground of delay in deposit of  rent in violation of the directions given in the second appeal  arising out  of Title Suit No. 6 of 1974. The impugned  order,   under  the   circumstances,   cannot   be sustained. Consequently,  we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned  order.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the High court of Punjab & Haryana, made on 31.5.1996 in CWP No. 19006/65. The  admitted   position  is  that  the  appellant  was appointed as  a constable  initially on 19.11.1981 in Hissar range. She  secured rank  No.2 out  of 218  candidates as an all rounder,  while Asha  Rani, respondent No.6, had secured rank No.85  in the same range. When ’C’ list was prepared in September  1985,   both  of   them  were  promoted  as  Head Constables on   October  3, 1985  and the  confirmation also came to  be made  on January  31, 1988.  In an  Intermediate school Course  conducted by  the authorities,  the appellant was depute  in  September  1989  while  6th  respondent  was deputed in March 1990. The appellant was brought in ’D’ List on April  4, 1990.  The appellant  was promoted as Assistant sub-Inspector on  November 16, 1989 while 6th respondent was confirmed as  ASI on July 31, 1992 but was not confirmed for no reason  whatsoever. But  when she  was  in  Upper  school Course in  April 1991, she become all rounded No.1 while 6th respondent was  sent for  the said  course and  training  in April 1993.  The appellant  was promoted as sub-Inspector on May 29, 1991 from P.T.C while 6th respondent was promoted on August 5, 1992. Thus it could be seen that the appellant has been stealing  a march over respondent No.6 right from March 1989 and  she distinguished  herself in  the posts  held  in several Places much earlier to respondent No.6. It would  appear that on a requested by 6th respondent, she was  transferred to  Rohtak range  while  the  appellant remained in  Hissar Range and was deputed, being a competent officer, to  train the trainees in the Training School. When deputation period was over, she was sought to be reverted to the  rank   of  Assistant   Sub-Inspector.  The  action  was obviously illegal  and arbitrary. It would, now, appear that after deputation  period was  over, she  was transferred  to Rohtak range  and appointed  as  S.H.O  in  Police  Station, Sonipat, Sixth respondent also has been continuing in Rohtak Range. Thus,  belatedly, the  Mischief is  averted  and  her http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 position is restored. Under these  Circumstances,  the  respondent  state  is directed to  continue  to  maintain  the  seniority  of  the appellant over  the 6th  respondent in  the respective posts though initially  they were  Temporary, Since  she had given better performance as all rounder.

One B.Q. Nandy is said to be the  tenant in the said premises. According to the appellants, Shri B.Q.

" O R D E R Leave granted. It is  not necessary  to dilate  all the details of the chequered history  of the  litigation. Suffice  it to  state that in  O.S. No.2/75  the Trial  Court passed a preliminary decree on April 24, 1982 thus: ""(1) that the  Plaint item 1 of ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’  schedule properties  be divided by  metes  and  bounds  into  two  equal shares taking the good and bad qualities thereon. (2)  that one  such share be delivered to the plaintiff and  the remaining  half  share  be delivered to the Ist defendant; ...."". In the  application for passing the final decree, there was a  controversy which  resulted  in  LPA  No.2651/91.  By judgment and  decree dated  August 24,  1994,  the  Division Bench directed thus: ""This, in our view, is not the correct position in law. We  are,   therefore,  constrained  to  set  aside  the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 16th August, 1991 in  A.S. No.2391  of 1990  confirming the order of the trial  Court dated 4th June, 1990 in I.A. No.626 of 1983 in  O.S. No.2  of 1975  and remit  the case to the trial Court  to pass  final decree  keeping in view the observations made above. It is  needless to  mention that  as the matter is pending final  determination for  quite some  time, the trial Court  should dispose  of the  same  without  any avoidable delay."" Sri  K.   Madhava  Reddy,  the  leaned  senior  counsel appearing for  the  appellants,  contended  that  since  the alienation was made prior to institution of the suit and the appellants being  the purchasers  from the  alienee  of  the Karta of  the joint  family, they  cannot be deprived of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 specific properties sold to them under the sales made in the year 1972.  Shri C.  Sitaramiah, learned  senior counsel for the respondents,  in particular for the son of the principal alienor,  submitted  that  since  the  appellants  are  only alinees of the alienees they have no right to seek equities. As the preliminary decree directed to work out the rights of the parties  taking into  account the good and bad qualities of the  lands  in  effecting  partition,  in  passing  final decree, the  respondents are  entitled to  the equities. The High Court  was, therefore, right in giving the direction in the impugned order. Having considered the respective contentions, we are of the view  that since  the preliminary  decree was allowed to become final,  the trial Court need to give effect to it. It is settled law that alienees of the alinees have no right to equities. Equally,  it is  settled law that a coparcener has no right  to sell  his undivided  share in  the joint family property and  any sale of undivided and specified items does not  bind   the  other   co-parceners.  Since  the  specific properties were  purchased prior  to the  institution of the suit for  partition, though  the appellants have no right to equities, it  could be  said that  the respective  share  to which  their   principal  alienor   was  entitled  would  be allotable to  them as  a special  case. However,  since  the preliminary decree  specifically directed  that the good and bad qualities of the land should be taken into consideration in effecting the partition, it should, in letter and spirit, be given effect to. While passing final decree, if the lands purchased by the appellants are found more valuable than the lands to  be allotted  to the  respondents,  the  respective values thereof  should be  ascertained and  the  respondents need to  be compensated in monetary value. That would be the effect of  the preliminary  decree as  well. Considered from this perspective, the direction issued by the Division Bench would be  modified as  above, and the trial Court would pass the final decree accordingly. The appeal  is allowed  in part  as above.  Parties are directed to bear their own costs.","In O.S. No.2/75, the Trial Court passed a preliminary decree on April 24, 1982.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Delay of 232 days condoned. The facts lie in a short compass. During the year 1982, while the respondent no.1 was working as a Branch Manager in Desh Priya branch of the United Bank of India at Calcutta it was realised  that certain officers working in that bank had conspired with  a creditor  and the bank was defrauded for a sum of  Rs.45,000/-. On  a complaint  laid, a crime case was registered and  the appellant  investigated the  matter  and submitted  the   report  to   the  competent  authority  for sanction, who,  by its  order dated  the 14th  January, 1987 accorded  sanction   under  6(1-c)   of  the  Prevention  of Corruption Act,  1947 (for  short,  ‘PC  Act)  to  file  the charge-sheet  against   the  respondent   for  the  offences punishable under Section 120B, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A, 201 and 109  IPC and  also under  Section  5(1)  (d)  read  with Section 5(2)  of the  PC  Act.  The  respondent  filed  writ petition in  the High  Court to quash the sanction. The High Court by  the impugned  order dated  the 2nd  April, 1992 in Matter  No.498/87  quashed  the  sanction  on  two  grounds, namely, that the respondent was not given any opportunity of hearing before  granting sanction  and in  the  departmental enquiry conducted  by the Bank, respondent was exonerated of the charge.  Therefore, it was not expedient to proceed with the prosecution  of the  respondent. Hence, the above appeal has been filed. It is  contended for the appellant that the question of giving an opportunity to the charged officer before granting sanction does  not arise  since it  is not  a quasi-judicial function. Grant  of sanction  is an administrative function. What is  required is  that the  investigating officer should place all  the necessary  material  before  the  sanctioning authority who  should apply  its mind  to that  material and accord  sanction.   Therefore,  the   question   of   giving http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  accused  before  granting sanction does not arise. We find  force in the contention. The grant of sanction is only  an administrative  function, though it is true that the  accused  may  be  saddled  with  the  liability  to  be prosecuted in  a court of law. What is material at that time is that  the necessary  facts collected during investigation constituting the  offence  have  to  be  placed  before  the sanctioning authority  and it  has to consider the material. Prima  facie,   the  authority  is  required  to  reach  the satisfaction that  the relevant  facts would  constitute the offence and  then either  grant or refuse to grant sanction. The grant  of sanction,  therefore, being administrative act the need to provide an opportunity of hearing to the accused before according  sanction does  not arise.  The High Court, therefore, was clearly in error in holding that the order of sanction is  vitiated by  violation  of  the  principles  of natural justice. The second  ground of  departmental exoneration  by the disciplinary  authority   is  also  not  relevant.  What  is necessary and material is whether the facts collected during investigation would  constitute the  offence for  which  the sanction has been sought for. It is  not appropriate  at this  stage to  go into  the merits of the culpability of the respondent though sought to be contended for by Shri Thopas Roy, the learned counsel. In fairness to the accused, we deem it inappropriate to go into the merits to express any opinion. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed, the  order of  the High Court  is set  aside and the trial court is directed to proceed  with   the  trial   against   the   respondent   as expeditiously as  possible and conduct joint trial, if trial is not  already concluded,  along with other accused. If the case has  been separated  and the trial of other accused has been  concluded,   then  the  trial  court  is  directed  to expeditiously conclude  the trial  of  the  respondent,  not exceeding one year.","In 1982, while the respondent no.1 was working as a Branch Manager in Desh Priya branch of the United Bank of India at Calcutta it was realised that certain officers working in that bank had conspired with a creditor.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Patna High Court quashing the order passed by learned Additional District Judge, Fast Track Court Vth, Shekhpura. By the said order the learned Additional Sessions Judge held that respondent No.2-Munna Kumar was not juvenile and, therefore, there was no need to refer his case to the Juvenile Justice Board for ascertaining of his age and, then for trial. It was observed by the High Court that the prayer was rejected only on the ground that two or three witnesses were examined and though the accused was in possession of School Leaving Certificate, mark sheet etc. to show that he was a juvenile, the prayer could not have been rejected.  The High Court in a very cryptic manner observed that the application of the accused deserved to be allowed and directed the court below to consider the accused as a juvenile and to proceed accordingly. 3.      Learned counsel for the informant submitted that the documents produced had been analysed by the trial Court and it was categorically held that at the time of framing charge on observation it was noticed that he was major without any doubt. In the certificate filed his name was disclosed to be Priyatam Bihari though all through his name was stated to be Munna Kumar. Learned Single Judge of the High Court did not even consider as to how the conclusions of the trial Court suffered from any infirmity. Merely referring to the stand of the accused and even without analyzing the correctness or otherwise of the observations and conclusions made by the trial Court he came to hold that the accused was a juvenile. Additionally, the complainant was a party before the High Court but no notice was issued. There is no appearance on behalf of respondent No.2-accused. 4.      Learned counsel for the State supported the stand of the informant. 5.      The High Court has failed to notice several relevant factors.  Firstly, at the time of framing charges, the age of the accused was recorded as major.  Similarly, the difference in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 names in the documents has not been explained by the accused. 6.      Further, as rightly contended by learned counsel for appellant, no discussion has been made as to how the conclusions of the trial Court suffered from any infirmity. 7.      Finally, no notice was issued to the appellant before the mater was disposed of. 8.      Above being the position, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the matter is remitted to it to consider the matter afresh and pass a reasoned order in accordance with law. 9.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI J This appeal arises out of the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal appeal No.85/91. The  High   Court  confirmed   the  conviction  of  the appellant under  Section 498-A IPC, set aside his conviction under Section  302 IPC and convicted him under Section 304-B IPC. The order of sentence was also modified. What is  held proved  against the appellant is that his wife, Vijayalakshmi,  died an unnatural death within 2 years of  their  marriage  and  that  before  her  death  she  was subjected to  harassment by him because she was not bringing from her  parents the  remaining amount of dowry promised to him. As regards  the demand of dowry and harassment both the courts have thought it fit to accept the evidence. We do not find any  infirmity in  appreciation of  the said  evidence. Vijayalakshmi was not only harassed by the appellant but was also ill-treated  and  beaten  many  times.  There  is  also evidence of P.Ws. 5 and 15 which proves that sometime before the incident  which led  to her  death, there  was a quarrel between husband  and the  wife and  therefore she  wanted to leave his  house but  because of  pursuction by  R-5 not  to leave at mid-night, she had agreed to remain there till next day morning.  Their evidence further proves that ten minutes after Vijayalakshmi  had returned to her room P.Ws. 5 and 15 heard some  noise coming  from the appellant’s room and when PW. 5   went  there and  enquired had happened the appellant said ""Sorry  Sister"" and closed the door. After some P.Ws. 5 and 15  again heard  more noise  coming from the appellant’s room and  therefore, both  of them again went there. At that time they found that some other neighbours had also gathered there. The  appellant then  opened the  door. It was noticed that Vijaya  Lakshmi was  sitting under  a tap with her body fully burnt.  Their evidence  thus clearly  establishes that soon before her death she was ill-treated by her husband. The defence  of the  appellant was  that she  committed suicide. The  High Court  accepting the  version of  suicide thought it fit to acquit the appellant under Section 302 and convict him  under Section  304-B  because  harrasments  was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 proved and the death had taken place within about a year and half from  her marriage with the appellant. we find that the High Court  has correctly  appreciated the  evidence and has given  good  reasons  for  convicting  the  appellant  under Section 304-B and 498-A IPC. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.","The appeal arises out of the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal appeal No.85/91.

" JUDGMENT 2000 (1) SCR 1136 The following Order of the Court was delivered : This appeal by special leave arises out of arbitration proceedings. The High Court of Orissa dismissed an appeal filed by the appellant against the order of Subordinate Judge, Bhubaneshwar making an award made by the Arbitrator a rule of the Court, The three main issues with which we are concerned in this appeal are : ""1. Whether the Arbitrator could have granted an award for escalation in favour of the contractor? 2. Whether the Arbitrator could have awarded pendente lite inter-est in favour of the contractor? and 3.  Whether the Arbitrator could have granted interest for the pre- reference period?"" It is not disputed that the arbitration agreement contained no escala-tion clause. In the absence of any escalation clause, an Arbitrator cannot assume any jurisdiction to award any amount towards escalation. That part of the Award which grants escalation charges is clearly not sustainable and suffers from a patent error. The decree, insofar as the award of escalation charges is concerned, cannot, therefore, be sustained. It is conceded by Ms. Mana Chakraborty, learned counsel for the State that the issue relating to the power of the Arbitrator to grant interest pendente lite where the agreement between the parties, as in the present case, did not prohibit grant of interest and the dispute referred to the Arbitrator included the claim of interest, is no longer res-integra and stands settled in favour of the claimant and against the State in Secretary, Irrigation Department, Government of Orissa & Others v. G.C. Roy, [1992] 1 SCC 508, overruling the view to the contrary as expressed in Executive Engineer [Irrigation) Balimela & Others v. Abhaduta Jena & Others, [1998] 1 SCC 418. The decree to the extent, it awards pendente lite interest in favour of the respondents, therefore, is sustained and the challenge to it fails. So far as the award of interest for pre-reference period is con-cerned, it appears appropriate to us, keeping ia view the fact that the proceedings in this case have remained pending for almost one and a half decade and the arbitration started as early as in 1975, to direct that the respondent shall execute the decree relating to the award of pre-reference interest only on furnishing a bank guarantee to the extent of that amount together with an undertaking that in the event the Constitution Bench, to which this issue has been referred to in Executive Engineer, Dhankanat Minor Irrigation Division, Orissa v. N.C. Budhiraj (Dead) by L.Rs. (Civil Appeal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 No. 3586 of 1984), decides against the decreeholder-respondents, the State shall be entitled to encash the bank guarantee. The respondents shall keep the bank guarantee alive during the pendency of the matter before the Constitution Bench and on furnishing the bank guarantee and the undertaking the respondents can execute the decree in that behalf. Thus, the appeal is disposed of in above terms. The impugned judgment and decree shall stand modified accordingly. No costs.","The High Court of Orissa dismissed an appeal filed by the appellant against the order of Subordinate Judge, Bhubaneshwar making an award made by the Arbitrator a rule of the Court.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard learned counsel on both sides. The admitted  position is  that the respondents came to be appointed  by proceedings  dated  April  25/26,  1985  as Constables in  the State  Armed Police.  The basis for their recruitment  was   the  list  furnished  by  the  Employment Exchange, Katwa.  They are  discharged from  the service  by proceedings effective  from January 1, 1986 which came to be challenged in  the High  Court. The High Court has set aside the order  of discharge.  On appeal, it was confirmed in MFA No.682/1987 by  order dated March 26, 1991. Thus this appeal by special leave. In  the   discharge  order,  it  was  stated  that  the respondents had exercised the power under Rule 34 [b] of the West  Bengal   Service  Regulations   [Part   I]   and   the instructions contained in Memo No.4145[2] dated November 22, 1985 of  the Assistant  Inspector General  of  Police,  West Bengal. It is not in dispute that the Commissioner of Labour in his  letter dated  September 5/7,  1985 had  informed the appellants that  the list  of the  names  forwarded  by  the Employment Exchange  was  fake  one  and  their  names  were fabricated as  they do  not correspond to the entries in the Employment   Exchange.   Consequently,   he   directed   the appellants to  take action according to rules. It would thus be clear  that the foundation for discharge is production of fake  list   of  persons   from  employment   exchange   for recruitment  as   Armed  Reserved  Constables.  If  that  is accepted, then  it would  cause a  stigga on the respondents for future  recruitment as  they  have  produced  fictitious record to  secure employment.  Principles of natural justice require that  they should be given reasonable opportunity of representation  in   the  enquiry   to  be   conducted   and appropriate orders  with reasons  in support thereof need to be passed.  It  is  settled  legal  position  and  the  said procedure has  not been followed. Under these circumstances, the High Court had not committed any error in dismissing the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appeal. It  would be  open to the appellants to issue notice to all the respondents and consider their case and then pass appropriate orders  with reasons, however brief they may be, in support  thereof within  a period  of six  weeks from the date of  the receipt of this order. The said notice shall be given to  the respondents  stating the grounds on which they seek to  discharge them  and the respondents are directed to submit their objections, if any, and the material in support thereof within  one month  thereafter. After  receipt of the objections, the  appellants are  directed  to  consider  the objections and  pass appropriate  orders  within  six  weeks thereafter  and   to  communicate   the  same   to  all  the respondents with  acknowledgement due.  The order, as stated earlier, should  contain concise reasons in support of their conclusions. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","High Court has set aside the order  of discharge.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION : Review Petition Nos. 43 and 44 of 1975. Application for review of this Hon’ble Court’s Judgment dated 11th  October 1974  in the  matter of Civil Appeal No. 1738 of 1973. A.  K.  Sen,  M.  Veerappa  and  Altaf  Ahmed  for  the Petitioners in Review Petition No. 43 of 1975. Y. S.  Desai and  R. B.  Datar for  the Petitioners  in Review Petition No. 44 of 1975. The order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER,  J. A  judgment of the final Court of the land is final. A review of such a judgment is an exceptional phenomenon, permitted  only where  a grave and glarind error http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 or other well-established ground is made out. Unfortunately, the theoretical  possibility, successful  in  a  microscopic rarity,  of  cases,  has  led  to  frequent,  unfounded  and indiscriminate petitions,  almost as  a routine  sequel to a defeat in Court. The present review petitions fall under the latter  category  and  fail  by  the  former  test  and  are therefore dismissed. Shri Asoke  Sen made  a limited submission on behalf of Dayananda  Sagar   in  CMP   2095  of   1975  that   certain observations in  the ’Judgment almost branding his client as an  unindicted  criminal-guilty  of  abetting  forgery’  and purjury-were altogether unmerited and should be obliterated. While we cannot agree to this course, we admit that these 122 strictures are  in no way integral to the decision, although relevant if we take an overall view. It is  true that  the words used are strong and we felt then that  they were  warranted. After hearing both sides we deem it  meet to  soften the judicial blow. Shri Sen submits that we  were misled in reaching the inference drawn. Maybe, we were.  Judge Learned  Hand once  said that  the spirit of liberty is  ’the spirit  which is  not too  sure that  it is right’. that  great Judge  was ’fond of recalling Cromwell’s statement: ’I beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think that ye may  be mistaken’.’ He told a Senate Committee, ’I should like to  have that written over the portals of every church, every school  and every court-house, and may I say, of every legislative body in the United States. 1 should like to have every court  begin. ’I  beseech ye  in the  bowels of Christ think that  we may be mistaken’. (Yale Law Journal: Vol. 71, 1961 November part). In a  sense,  it  is  this  likelihood  of  error  that persuaded Jesus  Christ to  caution: ’Judge  not, that ye be not judged’.  Our search for truth sometimes reaches a blind alley expressed  by Bacon:  ""’what is  truth?  said  Jesting Pilato: and would not stay for an answer’."" In this conspectus of great sayings, we are inclined to be humble  in spirit  and free to tone down the harshness of the  characterisation  to  some  extent.  We  would  content ourselves by  saying that  the materials placed before us in appeal, read  in the  light of  the conclusionls of the High Court, may  well lead  to  the  inference  and  justify  the observations made  by US,  although it  may not be ruled out that a  more innocent inference exculpating any role for the petitioner is  possible. Thus far, we modify the rigour, but decline to  cancel, as  pleaded by  the  petitioner.  Wisdom cannot  be   confounded  with  obstinacy  and  a  charitable construction of  a situation cannot be excluded. That is why we have consented to the dilution.

It  was disclosed in the agreement that  the  said Chari  having  retired  from the Government service  as  the Secretary  to the Government of India wanted to settle  down at  Bangalore  after  selling out the property  and  he  had entered  into  an  agreement  to   purchase  a  property  at Bangalore.   On  an  application  filed in  Form  37-I,  the Appropriate Authority proceeded to compare the said property with  properties  comprised in S-237, Greater Kailash I  and E-547,  Greater  Kailash II.  According to  the  Appropriate Authority  the fair market value with reference to the first property was worked out at Rs.35 lakhs and with reference to the other property at Rs.  42 lakhs.  The property comprised in  N-84,  Greater  Kailash I has three  sides  open  though measuring  1532 sq.  ft.  and a lot of space has been wasted due  to  load bearing walls while the property comprised  in S-237,  Greater  Kailash  I  has  two  sides  open  and  the construction  is far superior with servant quarters and  car parking  and property comprised in E-547, Greater Kailash II is  altogether in a different locality.

Whatever be the value of the property the same was being sold  under certain special circumstances which could not be ignored  by  the  Appropriate Authority.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R This special leave petition was placed for consideration on 24.09.2007 on which day we dismissed the same, but directed that reasons shall follow which are recorded hereunder. The respondents filed a suit in the City Civil Court, Calcutta, for eviction of the defendants-petitioners  from the suit premises on the grounds that the defendants changed user of the suit premises from residential to commercial, caused material deterioration in condition of the premises and made construction on the open terrace in the second floor of the premises in question without consent of the landlord. The defendants entered appearance and filed written statement contesting the claim for ejectment  on all the grounds. During trial, the parties adduced evidence in support of their respective cases and upon conclusion of the same the trial court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove  the ground of change of user, but succeeded in proving  the other two grounds and consequently passed a decree for eviction. Against the order of eviction, the defendants preferred an appeal before the High Court which though reversed the finding of the trial court on the question of material deterioration in condition of  the suit premises, but concurred with that of the trial court that the defendants made construction on the open terrace in the second floor of the premises in question without consent of the landlord and accordingly, the appeal was dismissed, against which order the present special leave petition was filed. Having heard the parties and perused the records,  we are of the opinion that the trial Court as well as the High Court were quite justified in recording the finding, that the defendants made construction on the open terrace in second floor of the suit premises without consent of the landlord, after taking into consideration the evidence adduced on behalf of the parties and no interference by this Court is called for.  Special leave petition is accordingly dismissed. The petitioners are granted time till 30th June, 2008 to vacate the premises in question upon filing usual undertaking within six weeks from today in this Court.","The respondents filed a suit in the City Civil Court, Calcutta, for eviction of the defendants-petitioners from the suit premises.

" O R D E R The petitioner field an application in the High Court being Criminal Application No.2230/95 under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and secured an ad-interim anticipatory bail order which was to ensure upto 26.9.1995. The High Court imposed certain conditions, one of which was that he will report at the Police Station every day till 25.9.1995. The petitioner says that he has complied with each and every condition imposed under that order. Be that as it may, it was an ad-interim order which was to ensure upto 26.9.1995. When the matter came up on that day for final disposal before the same learned Judge, he directed the petitioner to move a regular bail application before the Court which was in seining of the criminal case pending against him and observed that the bail application should be disposed of uninfluenced by the observations made in the earlier order of 13.9.1995. It is against this order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court that this SLP is filed. We see no reason to entertain this petition. Under Section 400 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, the High Court or the Court of Session may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail and in passing that order, it may include such conditions having regard to the facts of the particular case, as it may deem appropriate. Anticipatory bail is granted in anticipation of arrest in non-bailable cases, but that does not mean that the regular court, which is to try the offender, is sought to be by-passed and that is the reason why the High Court very rightly fixed the outer date for the continuance of the bail and on the date of its expiry directed the petitioner to move the regular Court for bail. That is the correct procedure to follow because it http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 must be realised that when the Court of Session or the High Court is granting anticipatory bail, it is granted at a stage when the investigation is incomplete and, therefore, it is not informed about the nature of evidence against the alleged offender. It is, therefore, necessary that such anticipatory bail orders should be of a limited duration only and ordinarily on the expiry of that duration or extended duration the Court granting anticipatory bail should leave it to the regular Court to deal with the matter on an appreciation of evidence placed before it after the investigation has made progress or the charge-sheet is submitted. It should be realised that an order of anticipatory bail could even be obtained in cases of serious nature as for example murder and, therefore, it is essential that the duration of that order should be limited and ordinarily the Court granting anticipatory bail should not substitute itself for the original court which is expected to deal with the offence. It is that Court which has then to consider whether, having regard to the material placed before it, the accused person is entitled to bail. In the instant case, therefore, the High Court had followed the correct procedure and we see no reason to interfere. However, Mr.Phasme, learned counsel for the petitioner, states that since this Court had granted an interim order by which the duration of the order was extended he has not applied for bail before the regular Court. He may do so, if he so desires, within two weeks from today. The petition will stand disposed of accordingly.","The High Court imposed certain conditions, one of which was that he will report at the Police Station every day till 25.9.1995.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. This  appeal  arises  from  the  order  of  the  C.A.T. Trivendrum Bench, made on 8.3.1996 in O.A. No. 1399/95. The only  controversy  is  whether  the  respondent  is entitled   to appointment by direct recruitment to a reserve vacancy? Admittedly,  Rule 1  () of  the Ministry of Defence Recruitment of  Stenographer, (Grade  III) Rules  postulates appointment by  promotion; failing  that, by  transfer;  and failing both,  by direct  recruitment.  In  this  case,  the sources of appointment, viz, by promotion and transfer, were exhausted. Consequently,  the appellants  resorted to direct recruitment  and  the  respondent  was  called  through  the Employment Exchange  for selection. Though she was selected, she was not given appointment on the specious ground that by proceedings under  Ex. A3  the post was dereserved and that, therefore,  she   was  not  eligible  for  appointment.  The Tribunal  has   not  agreed   with  the  contention  of  the appellants and  directed them  to appoint  the respondent in accordance with Rules thus this appeal, by special leave. It is  seen that Rule 1(a) postulates three sources for recruitment -  first by promotion, second by transfer and on failing  both  of  these  methods,  by  direct  recruitment, Admittedly, the  post was  reserved  for  Scheduled  Castes. Accordingly, the  respondent was  called for selection. When the candidate  was available,  resort to  dereservatiion  is clearly illegal  and, therefore,  the Tribunal  was right in giving the  direction to appoint the respondent who was duly selected by the Committee.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  arises against the order of the M.P. Admn. Tribunal, Bhopal Bench in Transferred Application No.1794/88 dated 5.3.1993.  The only question in this appeal is whether the claim  for promotion as Assistant Forest Conservator was considered in  accordance with Rules. We have called for and perused the  record. A High Level Committee, consisting of a Member  of   the  Public  Service  Commission  as  Chairman, Secretary to the Government, Forest Department and Principal Chief Conservator  of Forests as members, was constituted to consider the claims of all eligible persons for promotion as Assistant/conservator of Forest. The criteria adopted by the Committee was  in accordance  with the  M.P. Forest  Service (Recruitment) Rules,  1977, (for  short, ’the  Rules’).  The zone  of   consideration  was   five  times  the  number  of vacancies. Thereby  there was  wide chances  for many  to be considered. Only  officers with  a minimum  of  8  years  of service  and   confirmed  in   the  cadre   of  Ranger  were considered. The  selection was  based  on  merits  with  due regard to  seniority. The merit was assessed on the basis of recorded annual confidential reports of the officers for the previous five  years  to  the  year  of  consideration.  The yardstick of  merit adopted  was that  average assessment of last five  years C.Rs.  should be  above  ""good"".  Integrity should be  beyond doubt. In the case of officer against whom departmental enquiry  was in  progress, assessment  was made without prejudice  to the  result of  the said enquiry which was placed  in  a  sealed  cover  to  be  opened  after  the departmental enquiry proceedings are completed. Based thereon, the claims were considered and initially the appellant  was not  found  fit  for  promotion  and  was rejected. The  Tribunal, after  examination of  the  matter, gave the following direction: ""We conclude  that the  D.P.C. has erred http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 in  taking   into   consideration,   the uncommunicated adverse  remarks for  the period   ending    March,   1978   while considering the  applicant’s fitness for promotion  to   the   post   of   Asstt. Conservator of  Forests. We  accordingly direct   that    a   fresh   D.P.C.   be constituted for  evaluating  applicant’s claim for  promotion with  retrospective effect. The  D.P.C. shall  not take into consideration the  adverse  remarks  for the yer  ending March,  1978, otherwise, it may  follow  the  same  criteria  for adjudging  applicant’s  suitability  for promotion as  has been  followed by  the D.P.C. held  in 1982.  The applicant, if found    fit,     will    be    entitled retrospective  notional   promotion  and seniority from the date his juniors were promoted. For  the reasons  recovered in para 3 above, the applicant will not be, however, entitled  to any  consequential cash benefits."" Pursuant thereto,  excluding the  adverse comments made for  the   year  ending  with  March,  1978,  the  Committee reconsidered the matter and found the appellant not eligible for promotion. Though Sri Pandey sought to canvass the claim on merits, we cannot evaluate ourselves the relative merits. A high  level committee objectively considered the claim and found the  appellant was not fit for promotion on merits. We are satisfied  about this  on perusal  of the proceedings of the Committee.

" O R D E R The  Land   Acquisition  Officer  awarded  compensation Rs.3,500/- per acre for bagayat land and for the rest of the land (jirayat  dry) at  Rs.960/- per acre. On reference, the civil Judge  enhanced the  compensation to  Rs.10,000/-  per acre for bagayat lands in which sugar cane was grown and for the rest  of the  land he granted at Rs.4000/- per acre. The High Court  of Karnataka  in  the  impugned  judgment  dated September 9,  1988 confirmed the same. Thus these appeals by special leave. Two contentions  have been  raised  by  Shri  Veerappa, learned counsel  for the  appellant. The reference Court had wrongly applied  multiplier of  15 years  in  computing  the annual yield.  This Court in Land Acquisition Officer vs. P. Veerabhadrappa etc.etc. [(1984) 2 SCR 386] followed in other judgments, had  held that  10 years’ multiplier would be the proper method of calculation of the compensation. Accordingly 10  years’ multiplier  should be applied in determining compensation  under Section  23 (1)  of the Land Acquisition Act,  1894.  He  also  contended  that  separate compensation granted  the well in the sum Rs.13,000/- is not valid in  law. When  the owner  of the  land is  getting the water drawn  from the  well to  raise the  crops and when he claims compensation  for the land on the basis of the yield, he  cannot  separately  claim  compensation  for  the  well. Therefore, the  reference Court  obviously was  in error  in granting compensation  for the  well at  Rs.13,000/-. It  is accordingly set aside. 10 years multiplier should be applied to  the  annual  value  of  The  yield  for  calculation  of compensation under  Section 23 (1) of the Act. The reference Court   accordingly   is   directed   to   recalculate   the compensation   under    these   principles   and   determine compensation and pay over the respondents. If the amount has already been  recovered it would be open to the appellant to recover the balance amount. The appeals are accordingly allowed.

The Registrar rejected the said petition under Order XVIII, Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966.  Petitioner challenges this order. We heard the petitioner-in-person. The petitioner has a grievance that though his discharge from Air Force was held to be not valid by the High Court, it did not order his http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reinstatement nor gave any pecuniary benefits to him.  Feeling aggrieved by the same,  the petitioner-in-person had all along been unsuccessfully pursuing these remedies.  However,  as the SLP filed by the petitioner-in-person  against the order of the High Court dated 15.5.1975 was dismissed,  all subsequent proceedings initiated by him were nothing but an exercise in futility. In our opinion,  the Registrar was justified in holding that the petitioner-in-person has no cause of action to continue these proceedings any longer.  No relief could be given to help the petitioner-in-person in these proceedings in the absence of any cause of action, notwithstanding the fact that he had succeeded before the High Court.  The order passed by the Registrar is affirmed and this application is disposed of accordingly.","The petitioner-in-person was an officer in the Air Force. He was discharged from service on 8.10.1965. He filed a Civil Writ Petition (No. 335/1970) before the High Court of Delhi. The High Court disposed  of the matter on 15.5.1995. Though the discharge was held not valid, there was no order of reinstatement or damages.",civil,29.73
" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench made on November 11, 1993 in Writ Petition No.3505/93. The appellant was working  as on April 1, 1957 as Peon-cum-Watchman in the Hyderabad  Agricultural   Committee.  Consequent   upon  the State’s reorganisation, the appellant had gone to and joined the service  of the  Krishi Utpadan  Bazar Samiti  at  Jalna district. He  retired from  service on  April 1,  1991 after completing about 35 years of service. His qualifying service was computed  w.e.f. October 1, 1969. He claimed the service from the  date of  his appointment.  It was  denied  on  the ground that  he started  contributing towards Provident Fund w.e.f. the  aforesaid date  and,  therefore  his  pensionary benefit required to be computed from that date. Clause 23 of Chapter VI in the scheme reads as under: ""Qualifying  service  of  a  Market Committee employee  shall  commence from the  date he  takes charge  of the  post  to  which  he  is  first appointed  or  from  the  date  the employer started deducting the P.F. contribution for the employee which ever later. A reading clearly indicates that the qualifying service is from the date he takes charge of the post to which he was first appointed  or  from  the  date  the  employer  started deduction of  provident fund from the employee, whichever is later. Pension is not a bounty of the State. It is earned by the employee  for  service  rendered  to  fall  back,  after retirement. It  is a right attached to the office and cannot be arbitrarily  denied. Therefore, we read down the rule. We hold that  reading the  rule which  is ""later""  must be read down to  whichever is  ""earlier"". If  so read,  the rule  is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 valid. Otherwise, it would be arbitrary offending Article 14 of the Constitution. Mr. Khanwilkar, learned counsel for the respondent contended  that the  appellant is not entitled to the D.A.;  on  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the appellant contended that pursuant to the order passed by the High Court to pay D.A. resolution had already been passed by the Committee and the D.A. has already been paid to him. The pensionary  benefit will  be computed from April 1, 1957 within  two months  from the  date of  receipt of  this order and payment of arrears be paid accordingly.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (arising out of SLP(C)No.11914 of 2006) Leave granted. Heard the parties. The respondent, Shri Ganesh Prasad Sharma, was working as Senior Accounts Officer, O/O PGMT, Patna. It is stated that during the period 1999-2000 he failed to maintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty and committed gross misconduct in as much as he acted in a manner prejudicial to his Department. It is also alleged that he has acted in a manner unbecoming of a Government servant thereby contravening the provisions of Rule (1)(i)& (iii) of CCS(Conduct) Rules, 1964 (in short ’Rules’). A memorandum of chargesheet has been served upon the respondent on 25.2.2003. He retired on 28.2.2003. It appears that the conduct of the respondent along with one Kaniya Lal was inquired into by the CBI.  The CBI has exonerated both of them, however, observed that departmental proceedings may be initiated against them. Kaniya Lal was retired on superannuation on 28.2.2002 and, therefore, departmental proceedings could not be initiated against him. Under Rule 9(2)(a) & (b) Swamy’s Pension Compilation Incorporating CCS Pension Rules provides thus: \023(2)(a)      The departmental proceedings referred to in sub-rule(1), if instituted while the Government servant was in service whether before his retirement or during his re-employment, shall, after the final retirement of the Government servant, be deemed to be proceedings under this rule and shall be continued and concluded by the authority by which they were commenced in the same manner as if the Government servant had continued in service: Provided that where the departmental proceedings are instituted by an authority subordinate to the President, that authority shall submit a report recording its findings to the President. (b)  The department proceedings, if not instituted while the Government servant was in service, whether before his retirement, or during his re-employment,- (i)     shall not be instituted save with the sanction of the President, (ii)    shall not be in respect of any event which took place more than four years before such institution, and (iii)   shall be conducted by such authority and in such place as the President may direct and in accordance with the procedure applicable to departmental proceedings in which an order of dismissal from service could be made in relation to the Government servant during his service.\024 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In the case of Kaniya Lal since he was retired on superannuation with effect from 28.02.2002 no departmental proceeding was initiated against him.  The Tribunal was of the view that since no departmental proceeding has been initiated against Kaniya Lal, the departmental proceeding against Shri Ganesh Prasad Sharma, respondent herein is also  not tenable in law and set aside the disciplinary proceeding.  The writ petition of the appellant having  failed to produce any result this appeal has been filed by the appellant. In the case of the respondent herein, Shri Ganesh Prasad Sharma, the memorandum of charges was instituted on 25.2.2003.  He retired on 28.2.2003 after the disciplinary proceedings initiated against him. This would show that when the departmental proceedings was initiated against him on 25.2.2003 he was very much in service and, therefore, both the Tribunal and the High Court fell in error in quashing the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the respondent herein.  The cases of Kaniya Lal and Ganesh Prasad Sharma, respondent herein are distinctly different. In the view that we have taken both the orders of the Tribunal and the High Court are set aside.  The department may continue with the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent herein, Shri Ganesh Prasad Sharma and pass appropriate order. Since the proceedings are pending from 2003 we direct the appellant to complete the disciplinary proceedings preferably within six months from today.  We clarify that we do not express any opinion on the merit of this case. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","Shri Ganesh Prasad Sharma was working as Senior Accounts Officer, O/O PGMT, Patna.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7867 OF 2001 WITH C.A.NO.7868/2001; C.A. NO.7869/2001 & C.A. NO.7870/2001 These appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 24/11/2000 passed by the Division Bench in DBCWP Nos.1088/2000, 1267/2000, 1276/2000 & 1270/2000. Since the question involved in these appeals are identical, we are taking the facts from C.A. No.7867/2001. We have heard the parties at length. Briefly stated, the facts are as follows. Pursuant to a tender notice dated 9/2/1999, the appellant made an offer by its lette r dated 30/3/1999.  The said offer was subject to the following condition: ""CONDITION That during the term of Financial Year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, if any Liquor/Beer Group in the State of Rajasthan .....2. - 2 - is  granted  any  financial or policy based benefit or benefits in exclusive privilege amount, then the same benefit shall, in proportionate manner, be given in respect of Kota Liquor/Beer Group also."" The aforesaid offer was provisionally accepted by a letter dated 30/3/1999.  It appe ars that in the letter provisionally accepting the offer there is no mention that condition mentioned in the offer letter is rejected.  On the other hand, a close reading of the acceptance letter dated 30/3/1999 clearly shows that the offer by the appellant with the condition was accepted. In our opinion, the word ’provisionally’ in the acceptance letter dated 30/3/1999 only means that the offer of the appellant (with the condition) was accepted subject to his complying with the formalities mentioned in that letter. It appears that the financial benefits for other Liquor/Beer groups in Rajasthan during the financial year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 was not extended to the appellant. Aggrieved thereby, they preferred a writ petition. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The High Court was of the view that the condition which was offered and accepted by the State does not appear in the licence  and  on  this  sole  ground  the  writ  petition was ......3. - 3 - dismissed.  The finding of the High Court, in our view, is clearly erroneous.  As already noted, the appellant’s offer with the condition has been accepted by the respondent without any demur.  Since the offer has been accepted by the respondent the benefit during the financial year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 was also available to the appellant if the same has been granted to any other Liquor/Beer group in the State of Rajasthan. Learned counsel for the respondent strenuously contended that the condition in the offer was not accepted by the respondents and, therefore, the appelalnts are not entitled for any benefits during those financial years.  We do not agree.  We repeatedly asked the counsel for the respondent to show us in the letter of acceptance anywhere where it is mentioned that the condition was not accepted.  There is no answer forthcoming to this query.  Even otherwise, a reading of the letter of acceptance dated 30/3/1999 does not disclose that the conditional offer by the appellant was rejected.  On the contrary, the offer was accepted with the condition. Hence, it was a concluded contract under Section 7 of the Contract Act. .......4. - 4 - For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment of the High Court is not tenable in law.  It is, accordingly, set aside.  The appeals are allowed.  No costs.","The appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 24/11/2000 passed by the Division Bench in DBCWP Nos.1088/2000, 1267/2000,. 1276/2000 & 1270/2000.

The  controversy is no longer res integra. The admitted  facts are that the award under Section 11 of the  Land Acquisition  Act, 1894  was passed  on June 26, 1981. Notice under Section 12(2) was issued on September 18, 1981. After  lapse of three years, an application came to be filed on  July 30,  1985 seeking reference under Section 18. The land Acquisition Officer (Deputy Collector) rejected the application on  December 16,  1585. Challenging  that order, the  writ  petition  came  to  be  filed.  In  view  of  the provisions in  Section 18  (2) read  with Section  31 of the Act, after  the notice  was received under Section 12(2) the claimants are  required to file an application under Section 18 seeking  reference within  a period  of 30  days from the date of  the award  when the  claimants were  present at the time of making the award either in person or through counsel or within  six months  from the  date of  the receipt of the notice. In  view of  the fact  that  notice  was  issued  on September 18,  1981, the  application should have been filed within six weeks from the date of the Collector’s award when the person  was present  or was  represented by  the counsel before the  Collector or  six weeks  from the  date  of  the receipt of the notice under sub-section (2) of Section 12 or within six  months from  the date  of the Collector’s award, whichever period  shall first  expire.

" J U D G M E N T S.C. AGRAWAL, J.: Leave granted. The  appellants   in  this   appeal  were  employed  as Registration Clerks  on daily  wage basis  in the  office of Sub-Registrar, District  Jhansi on  various periods,  during the years  1990 and 1991. The case of the appellants is that in  response   to  the   notice  inviting  applications  for appointment  on   the  post   of  Registration  Clerks,  the appellants had  submitted their  applications and  they were required  to   appear   before   the   Selection   Committee constituted under relevant rules on February 24, 1991. Their claim is  that other  persons whose  names were sponsored by the Employment  Exchange  were  also  called  and  that  the appellants were  selected by  the Selection Committee and on the basis  of the  said selection,  they were  appointed  as Registration Clerks by the District Registrar by order dated March 18,  1991. It  is claimed that the said appointment of the appellants  was approved  by the  Inspector  General  of Registration on  April 15, 1991. Subsequently by order dated May 27, 1991 the Inspector General of Registration issued an order directing  the District  Registrar  to  terminate  the services of Registration Clerks employed on daily wage basis with immediate  effect. In pursuance of the said directions, the  District  Registrar,  District  Jhansi,  issued  orders terminating the  services of the appellants with effect from May  27,  1991  by  treating  them  as  Registration  Clerks employed on  daily wage basis. The case of the appellants is that they  were appointed  on regular basis after being duly selected in  accordance with  the rules.  They filed  a writ petition (Writ  Petition No. 17785/91) in the Allahabad High Court challenging  the order terminating their services. The said writ  petition was heard alongwith other matters of the Registration Clerks  who had  been appointed  on daily  wage basis and  was disposed of by common order dated February 8, 1995. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The grievance  of the  appellants is  that  their  case stands on  a different  footing inasmuch  as they  were  not employed as  Registration Clerks on daily wage basis but had been duly  selected by  the Selection  Committee constituted under the rules and they had been appointed on regular basis by the  District Registrar,  District Jhansi,  and the  said appointment had  also been approved by the Inspector General of Registration.  The learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that  in the  counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents  in the  writ petition before the High Court the factual  averments made  by the  petitioners in the writ petition were  not disputed.  In the counter affidavit filed on behalf  of the  respondents in  reply  to  special  leave petition before  this Court,  it has,  however, been  stated that the appointment of the appellants had been made without complying with  the provisions of rule 22 of the Subordinate Offices Ministerial Staff (District Recruitment) Rules, 1985 inasmuch as  the applications were accepted directly without issuing an  advertisement in the daily newspaper as required under the provisions of the said rule. It has been submitted that as  a result  of the  said  defect  the  selection  was defective ab  initio. This question has not been examined by the High  Court and  the High  Court has  dismissed the writ petition without  going into  the said  question. This  is a matter which requires consideration by the High Court.

" DER Leave granted. The  first  appellant Ram Lal stands convicted of  the offence  under  Section 326 of the IPC and is  undergoing  a sentence  of  three  Years.  The second appellant  has  been convicted  of  Sec.   324 of the IPC and  was  sentenced  to imprisonment  for  two years.  The parties have  compromised and  a  petition for compounding has been filed.  We  cannot accede  to  the  request for compounding in  regard  to  the offence   under   Section  326  IPC  as  the   same   is   a non-compoundable  offence.   Sri DD Thakur,  learned  Senior Counsel invited our attention to the decisions of this Court in Y.Suresh Babu vs.State of AP and another [1987(2) JT 361] and  Mahesh Chand and another vs.  State of Rajasthan  [1990 SCC  (Suppl)  681]  wherein  non-compundable  offences  were allowed  to be compounded.  In Y.Suresh Babu (Supra) it  was specifically  observed  that  the said case  ""shall  not  be treated  as a precedent"".  In the latter case (Mahesh Chand) offence under Section 307 IPC was permitted to be compounded with the following observations: ""We  gave  our anxious consideration to the  case  and also the plea pur forward for seeding permission to compound the  offence.   After examining the nature of the  case  and circumstances  under which the offence was committed it  may be proper that the trial court shall permit them to compound the offence."" We are unable to follow the said decision as a binding precedent  Section  320  which deals  with  ""compounding  of offences""  provides  two  Tables   therein,  one  containing descriptions  of  offences  which can be compounded  by  the person mentioned in it and the other containing descriptions of  offences which can be compounded with the permission  of the  Court  by  the persons indicated  therein.   Only  such offences  as  are  included in the said two  Tables  can  be compounded and none else.  Sub-Section (9) of Section 320 of the  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 imposes a  legislative ban in the following terms: ""(9) No offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section."" It  is apparent that when the decision in Mahesh Chand (Supra) was rendered attention of the learned Judges was not drawn to the aforesaid legal prohibition.  Nor was attention http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of  the learned Judges who rendered the decision in Y.Suresh Babu (supra) drawn.  Hence those were decisions rendered per incuriam.   We hold that an offence which law declares to be non-compoundable  even  with  the permission  of  the  Court cannot  be compounded at all.  The offence under Section 326 IPC  is,  admittedly, non-compoundable and hence  we  cannot accede  to the request of the learned counsel to permit  the same to be compounded. However,  considering the fact that parties have  come to  a settlement and the victims have non grievance now  and considering  the  further  fact  that  first  appellant  has already  undergone  a  period of imprisonment of  about  six months,  a lenient view can be taken and the sentence can be reduced  to  the period which he had already undergone.   We order  so  and  direct the jail authorities to  set  him  at liberty forthwith. Regarding  the second appellant we permit the  parties to  compound  the offence (section 324 IPC) in view  of  the joint  application filed by the legal representatives of the deceased  complainant  and  the second appellant  (vide  his application  No.   Crl.  M.P.No.  7648/98).  In view of  the aforesaid  compounding  of the offence under Section 324  of IPC  we set aside the conviction and sentence passed on  the second appellant and he is acquitted under Section 320(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.",The first appellant Ram Lal stands convicted of  the offence  under  Section 326 of the IPC and is undergoing  a sentence of  three  Years.

This appeal by special leave arises against an order of the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal,  Ernakulam  made  on 16.8.1994 in  OA No.2026/93.  The admitted  position is that while the  respondent was  working as Income-tax officer, he was dismissed from service. He laid a suit against the order of dismissal.  The suit  came  to  be  decreed  and  he  was consequently reinstated. Since the arrears were not paid, he filed a  writ petition  in the High Court.

Then  the  respondent  filed  an  OA claiming interest at 18% p.a. The Administrative Tribunal in the impugned  order directed  the payment of interest. Thus, this appeal by special leave.

Hence when the claim was made on earlier occasion,  he should  have or  might have sought and secured decree  for interest. He did not set and, therefore, it operates as res judicata.

It is  seen that the notification clearly mentions that the word  ’Papad’ has  been used a genus and its species are made from  pulses, rice,  maida, potato,  sago etc.  In  the notification the  words ""Papad  and Badi"", i.e. Mangori have been used  while in entry No.3 of the notification after the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 words  ""letter   head  pads""  the  words  ""other  stationery articles made  of handmade  paper"" have  been  used  meaning thereby that entry No.3 is not restricted to only invitation cards, envelopes,  file covers,  letter head  pads but  also includes other  stationery articles  made of handmade paper. The question  is:  whether  the  ingredients  of  papad  are exclusively composed  of the  pulses or  maida or rice, etc? When the  notification mentions papad and Badi, i.e. Mangori it would  appear that  they did  not intend to differentiate between gole or flat papad made of any ingredient. Under  those   circumstances  it   appears   that   the interpretation given  by the  High Court  is not correct and that of Tribunal is correct. The appeal is allowed and if there is any difficulty it would be  open to the Govt. to make necessary declaration in exemption notification itself by way of amendment. No costs.","The appellant made an application for exemption of Gole Papad manufactured out of Maida, Salt Starch, Papad Soda, Alum and Food colour from sales  tax.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. This special  leave petition  arises from  the judgment and order  dated July  16, 1996 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court in C.R.P. no. 5643. The first  respondent suffered  a decree in sum of Rs.. 2,400/- for  recovery of  which, obviously included interest and costs in a sum of Rs.4,000/-/-, his property was brought to sale on October 25, 1978 and the petitioner purchased the same for a sum of Rs.. 67,000/-. An application was filed by the respondent under Order XXI, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure  (CPC)   impugning  the   legality  of   the  sale conducted. The  executing Court dismissed the application by order dated  August 16,  1990. On appeal the appellate court set aside  the order  of the executing Court and allowed the petition declaring  that the  sale was illegal. On revision, the High  Court by  the order  has confirmed  the same.  The finding recorded  by the  appellate Court and the High Court is that non-compliance of the procedure required under Order XXI, Rule 64, CPC had vitiated the sale. It is  contended for  the petitioner that the executing Court having found that the adequacy of consideration is not a ground  for setting aside the sale but the appellate Court and the  High Court  have not  gone into that respect of the matter. The  appellant having  purchased the property valued in the  proclamation at  Rs. 85,000/-, The sale could not be set aside.  We find  no force  in the contention. IT is seen that the High Court has noted that the procedural compliance of Order  XXI, Rule  64, CPC  was not  adhered to which is a mandatory requirement  as held  by this Court in Desh Bandhu Gupta v/s  N.L. Anand  & Rajinder  Singh [(1991) 1 SCC 131]. Equally the sale consideration of the property was in excess of the  execution.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1458 OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(C) No.1305/2006] Leave granted. Heard the parties. In this appeal, an award made by the Arbitrator was filed before the Court for making it the rule of the Court.  The Civil Judge, Junior Division, Pathankot, refused to make the award rule of the court solely on the ground that the award was made after the expiry of the period.  Aggrieved thereby, a civil revision petition under Section 115 of CPC was filed before the High Court.  The High Court, on a consent of the parties, converted the petition into the one under Article 227 of the Constitution.  By its impugned order, the High Court condoned the delay.  So far as the order passed by the High Court condoning the delay in exercise of its discretionary power is concerned, we have nothing to say.  But while doing so, the High Court has also made the award rule of the  court  which  power  the  High  Court does not possess in ........2. - 2 - exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution.  In our view, therefore, the second part of the High Court order, making the award rule of the court, was exercised in excess of its jurisdiction.  To that extent, the High Court order is set aside.  Normally , the High Court should have remitted the matter to the trial  Court for a fresh consideration. Accordingly, the order of the High Court to the extent indicated above is set aside. The matter is remitted to the Civil Judge, Junior Division, Pathankot to hear the objections afresh and pass necessary orders in accordance with law.  Since the award has been made as far back in 1995, the Civil Judge, Junior Division, Pathankot shall expedite the hearing and pass orders preferably within three months.

" JUDGMENT O  R  D  E  R Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appellants were tried and, by judgment rendered by the Trial Court, they were acquitted of the charges.  On appeal being preferred by the State of Tamil Nadu, the High Court reversed the order of acquittal and convicted the appellants under Section 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code [hereinafter referred to as \023I.P.C.\024] and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life.  They have been further convicted under Section 148 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years.  The sentences, however, have been ordered to run concurrently.  Hence, this appeal. The conviction of the appellants is based upon the evidences of two eye- witnesses, namely, Poolpandi [P.W.1] and Marriammal [P.W.2].  We have been taken through the evidence of these two witnesses and we find that they have consistently supported the prosecution case and their evidence  is corroborated  by medical evidence.  In our view, ...2/- - 2 - as the order of acquittal suffered from the vice of perversity, the High Court was quite justified in reversing the same.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court. By the impugned judgment while believing the evidence of witnesses and the dying declaration recorded, the High Court was of the view that the conviction of the accused respondent was one punishable under Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’) and not under Section 302 IPC. Since the evidence of the witnesses and the dying declaration have been  accepted the only question that remains to be considered is whether the High Court was justified in holding that the case related to Section 304 Part II and not Section 302 IPC. 2.      The State of Karnataka questions correctness of the judgment.  Learned counsel for the respondent supported the impugned judgment. 3.      The only reason indicated by the High Court is as under: ""The entire narration at Ex.P.10 would point out that the accused got wild when the deceased questioned his wife, who is the sister of the accused. This shows that there is no pre-mediation or a motive for the accused to kill the deceased. On seeing the admonition the accused lost control and chased his brother-in-law. But by doing this, he had the knowledge that this action would definitely end up in the death of his brother in law. The knowledge of his action is clearly established from the material on record. Therefore, the offence do not fall under Section 304 IPC i.e. culpable homicide amounting to murder, but it is an offence falling under Section 304 Part II IPC."" 4.      The reasoning of the High Court is patently erroneous and does not disclose the application of mind. It is not conceivable as to why the person would chase another who had not committed any wrong to him and then set him on fire. The dying declaration goes to show that the accused got wild when the deceased questioned his wife who is the sister of the accused. The High Court found that there was no pre http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 meditation to kill the accused and on seeing the admonition the accused lost control and chased the deceased and set him to fire by pouring kerosene on him.  The High Court was of the view that the accused had knowledge that his action is definitely end up in the death of the deceased. On these observations the High Court held that the case was covered under Section 304 Part II IPC and not under Section 302 IPC. 5.      The order impugned is very confusing, does not disclose application of mind and it is not clear as to why the High Court felt that the case is covered under Section 304 Part II IPC and not under Section 302.  Since practically no reason has been indicated to justify the conclusion the order of the High Court is clearly unsustainable. We set aside the order of the High Court.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the  Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench at New Delhi. The admitted position is that the respondent along with others came  to be  appointed on September 3, 1990, November 14, 1991  and September  14, as  Class IV  employees in  the office of  the Controller  of Defence  Accounts on part-time basis. There  is  a  controversy  as  to  whether  they  are appointed on  hourly basis or on regular basis. The admitted position is  that they  were receiving the  consolidated pay of Rs.  500/- per  month which   was  raised to Rs.600/- per month for  working six  hours a  day. It is not necessary to consider the  case whether   it full-time or hourly basis or monthly basis.  Suffice it  to  state  that  they  were  not appointed to  a regular  post after  selection according  to rules; they  were appointed  as part-time  employees de hors the   rules. The  question, therefore, is : whether they are entitled  to  the  temporary  status  or  regularisation  as directed by  the Tribunal?  It is  seen that pursuant to the enquiry whether  temporary status  should be  granted to the part-time employees, directions  were issued by the Ministry of Personnel,  Public Grievances  and Pension dated July 12, 1994 in the Memorandum, Clause 3, that they are not entitled to such  status. Since  they are  not appointed  on  regular basis in accordance with rules the  direction  issued by the Tribunal to  regularise the service is obviously illegal. It is then contended by the learned counsel for the respondents that in  view of  the fact  that they were regularly working for a  long time  they are entitled to regularisation. We do not  appreciate   the  stand   taken  on   behalf   of   the respondents. Unless  they are  appointed  on  regular  basis according to  rules after  consideration of  the  claims  on merits, there  is  no  question  of  regularisation  of  the services.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.1925 OF 2002 The appellant is a small scale industry.  It commenced manufacturing electric fans falling under the erstwhile Tariff Item No.33 prior to coming into force of Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, after obtaining central excise licence.  Rotors and stators falling under Tariff Item 30D which are essential components required for the manufacture of electric fans, were also manufactured by the appellant and captively used.  The appellant, from time to time, also received orders for doing diverse specific specialised processing work on job work basis on customers’ raw materials like winding, die casting, coil setting etc. whic h did not transform the customers’ raw materials into rotors and stators as commercially known and the customers undertook various further processes in their own factories to manufacture rotors and stators and used the same in the manufacture of their fans. For the period January 1983 to March 1984, the Collector vide its order dated 31st M ay 1988 held that the rotors and stators were complete and were manufactured by the appellant and C.A.No.1925/02 ....

Order of the Tribunal as well as that of the Collector are under challenge in this appeal. Mr. Joseph Vellapally, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has brough t to our notice that in a case pertaining to earlier period from February 1982 to December 1982 of the assessee, the Collector (very same officer) in Order (Original) No.61(30-D)87- Collr. 57/89 dated 21st July 1989 took the view that rotors and stators were incomplete and were unfinished goods not known in the market as stators and rotors.  He also states that the subsequent order dated 21st July 1989 was brought to the notice of the Tribunal but the Tribunal did not take note of it.  In support of his assertion, learned senior counsel has filed an affidavit of the counsel who had appeared for the assessee before the Tribunal.  He further states that the Department has accepted the subsequent decision dated 21st July 1989 for the period February 1982 to December 1982.  He submits that in view of the fact that the Department has accepted the subsequent decision dated 21st July 1989 in which it has been held that the rotors and stators in the form in which they are cleared from the appellant’s factory are not finished goods and, therefore, not exigible to the levy of excis e duty, the present appeal be accepted and the impugned order be set aside.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP ) No.13904 of 2003) S. N. VARIAVA, J. Delay condoned. Special leave granted. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not placed in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 553 in Sector-45, Gurgaon, on 2nd February 1998.  At the time of allotment price of plot was fixed at Rs.6,80,262/-.  It was then enchanced to Rs.9,57,117/- pursuant to an Award of a Court.  However, the High Court thereafter reduced the Award and by the reduction the price became Rs.6,53,400/-.  The Appellants did not recalculate the price in terms of High Court Award and did not also carry out development work.  As the possession was not being delivered at the correct price the Respondent filed a complaint. The District Forum by its Order dated 24th December 2001, awarded interest @ 15% after two years from the date of deposit till the offer of possession.  It also awarded Rs. 2 lacs as escalation in the cost of construction and a further amount of Rs.25,000/- as costs. The State Commission increased the rate of interest from 15% to 18%, but http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 set aside the Award of Rs. 2 lacs.      The National Commission has dismissed the revision. We are told that interest @ 12% has been paid and/or is adjusted against the amount payable by the Respondent.  Possession has also been offered on 15th March 2001.  In our view, as the possession is being delivered, interest @ 12% is sufficient.  We, therefore, maintain the Order of the State Commission, save and except that interest shall be paid @ 12%.  The Appellants to forthwith pay to the Respondent the sum of Rs.25,000/- and balance payment of interest @ 12%, if any, remaining payable.  The Respondent is at liberty to take possession. The Appellants to inform the Respondent that he can take possession at the rate of Rs.6,53,400/-. The Appellants shall deliver possession without demanding any higher amount.  They can however insist on registration charges being paid. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as it has been passed by taking into account special features of the case.  The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

" O R D E R The petitioner  filed a writ petition in the High Court for direction  to pay  the equal  pay on  par  with  Medical Officer at  Rs.2200-4000/-. There  was  a  long  controversy regarding the  entitlement  of  the  petitioners  and  their companions for  the said  scale of  pay. Ultimately,  it was referred to  the Anamoly  Committee which had decided in his proceedings dated  1.1.1995 accepting  the new pay scales of different posts  in the  Urban  Local  bodies,  namely,  the persons like  the petitioners would be paid the scale of pay at Rs.2200-4000/- and recommended to upgrade the said  scale from November 7, 1994 and to pay the scales of pay from that date. The  Government has  accepted the above recommendation and issued  orders on  February 16, 1995. Calling that order in question,  the petitioners  have filed  the writ petition seeking payment of arrears from 1986. Initially,  direction   were  given  by  the  Court  to consider why  the petitioners  were not  being  paid  w.e.f. 1.1.1986. After consideration again, the respondent filed an affidavit explaining  the circumstances. Undoubtedly, one of the circumstances stated was that previously the petitioners were unequals  and were  not being  paid the  same pay  and, therefore, they  were not entitled to the same scale of pay. The Division  bench of the High Court dismissed the petition by order dated September 21, 1995. It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the petitioners that  the reason given by the respondents is not relevant since  the Anamoly  Committee recommended that they are performing  the same  duties on  par  with  the  Medical Officers. Therefore,  the High  Court ought  to have granted them the  scale of pay from 1986. As stated earlier, reasons given in  the counter-affidavit  may not  be correct reasons but the  Anamoly Committee  had recommended  for payment  of same scale of pay to the persons like the petitioners w.e.f. November 7,  1994. It is well settled law that fixing a date is not  arbitrary violating  Article 14.  It is  settled law http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that the authorities cannot pick up from their hat and fix a date. The  question,  therefore,  arises  for  decision  is: whether the  date  fixed  is  arbitrary?  The  question  was referred to  the Anamoly  Committee to advise the Government as to the fixation of the scale of pay to which persons like the petitioners would be entitled to. The Committee had gone into the  question and  recommended  the  scale  of  pay  of Rs.2200-4000/- to  the persons like the petitioners and also recommended to  give effect  from the date on which they had decided, namely  November 7,  1994.  The  Government  having accepted the  same and  given effect  from the  date.  Under those circumstances, it cannot be said that fixation of date is arbitrary violating Article 14. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner filed a writ petition in the High Court for direction  to pay equal  pay on  par  with  Medical Officer at  Rs.2200-4000/-. There was a long controversy regarding the entitlement of the petitioners and their companions for the said scale of pay.

It would appear that  pending  appeal,  the  appeal,  obviously,  must  have retired from  service. However, if the case of the appellant had been  considered in the light of the direction issued by this Court, no further action would have been needed.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Madras High Court, made on 6.1.1995 in C.R.P. No.404 of 1993. the appellant  is the  talent and the respondent is the landlady. Admittedly,  a lease for 11 months was executed on 18.2.1998 at  a rent  in the  sum of  Rs.2,800/- per  month. Notice was  given on  June 13,1998  on the  ground that  the appellant had committed wilful default in the payment of the rent for  three months.  Reply thereto  was  given  on  June 20,1998 denying  the allegations.  By the time, the petition came to  be filed  by the respondent, the default came to be for six  months. As  a consequence, O.A No.2709/88 was filed for eviction  of the respondent under sections 10(2) (i) and 10(ii) (b)  of Tamil  Nadu Building  Lease and  Rent Control Act, 1960.  The Rent  Controller  ordered  eviction  on  the ground of wilful default and also for using the premises for purpose other  than for which it was let out. On the appeal, it was  reversed. But  in the  revision. the High Court held that the  appellant has  committed  wilful  default  in  the payment of  the  rent.  Thus,  it  confirmed  the  order  of eviction passed by the Rent Controller. The question  is :  whether the appellant has committed wilful default of payment? In the counter affidavit filed in this Court,  it is  specifically stated  that lease  for  11 months  was   granted  with  an  intention  that  after  the retirement of  the respondents  husband they could come back from  the   United  States   of  America  and  settled  down permanently in  Madras the  demised  premises.  It  is  also stated in  paragraph 12  of the  Counter-affidavit that wife and the husband sustained injuries in a car accident and due to the  severe back pain, particularly during winter season, they had  decided to come back. In fact, her husband retired from service  on April 15,1995. When the respondents husband retired from  service, they decided to permanently come back and settle  down in  Madras. Thus  it is  obvious that  they needed their  house for personal occupation. It is true that the need  for personal  occupation was  not pleaded.  It  is settled law  that for moulding the relief, subsequent events can be  taken note of. Under those circumstances, the relief http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of eviction  could be  granted on  the  ground  of  personal occupation. The  amount  of  Rs.24,000/-  deposited  by  the appellant shall be adjusted towards the arrears of the rent. If the arrears to be paid, time is given to the appellant to pay the  same. Six  months time from today is granted to the appellant to  deliver the  vacant possession of the premises on filing  usual undertaking  within a  period of four weeks from today.  The respondent  is also  directed  to  file  an affidavit within a period of six weeks from today that after their coming  back from  the States,  they shall neither let out the building to the third party nor induct any party and shall permanently  stay in the back for the United States of America within  a period  of ten  years from  today. In  the event of their leaving for the United States within the said period the  talent would be at liberty to seek possession of the premises. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

In this matter, a penalty of removal from service was imposed on the appellant.  Against the removal order, the appellant filed an appeal, which was dismissed. Later he challenged the said order before the Tribunal and a further review was also filed.  The Tribunal and the Reviewing Authority have also dismissed the respective petitions. Thereupon, he moved a writ petition invoking jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.  The High Court also, for the reasons set out at page 4 & 5 of its order, dismissed the writ petition.  We have perused the order passed by the High Court and other connected records. When the matter came up for hearing on 18.10.2006, this Court passed the following order: ""Prima facie, we are of the view that the petitioner had not been afforded proper opportunity to defend himself inasmuch as the Inquiry Officer had refused to summon the witnesses cited by the workman. The dispute has been going on for the last 15 years. It would not be in the interest of justice to start the proceedings all over again.  We have suggested to the counsel for the parties to settle the dispute for which they seek time. Adjourned by four weeks."" Again the matter was listed before this Bench on 15.11.2006, when the court passed the following order: ""A letter is circulated by Mr. Praveen Jain, Advocate for the petitioner that the settlement between the parties is likely to taken some more time and hence he requested that the matter may be adjourned by six weeks.  Learned ASG appearing on behalf of the respondent-Union of India also made the similar request as, according to him, the competent authority who has to approve the terms of settlement is not available now. The matter is adjourned by four weeks for reporting settlement."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Today, the matter is listed before us for reporting settlement. Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India, on instruction from the respondent, submitted that even though the appellant has lost before almost all the forums, the respondents, taking a lineant view of the matter and also as per the directions of this Court, have considered the matter on sympathetic ground and are ready and willing to pay the last drawn salary of Rs.1672/- p.m. for the last ten years.  The total amount comes to Rs.2,00,640/-.  In our opinion, the said sum of Rs.2,00,640/- is inadequate. We, therefore, direct the respondents herein and in particular respondent no.2 to pay a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees three lakhs only) in full quit of all the claims by the appellant.  We make it clear that the appellant shall not be entitled to any other payment from the respondents.  The respondents are directed to pay the said sum of Rs.3 lakhs within six weeks from today, failing which the said amount shall carry interest at 18% till the date of payment.  The said sum of Rs.3 lakhs shall be paid  by way of Demand Draft payable at Kapurthala and drawn in the name of the appellant herein, namely, Tej Pal Singh.  The appellant is directed to collect the Demand Draft from the respondent-in-person. The appeal is disposed off in the above terms.

" J U D G M E N T HANSARIA,J. The appellant  has been  convicted under  section 25 of the Arms Act read with section 5 of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention)  Act, (for  short  ’TADA’).  It  has pained us  to know  that  despite  he  having  a  full-proof defence, it  has come to be rejected by the Designated Court on the ground that it was ""an after thought"". The appellants defence was that the .315 bore rifle, which was said to have been recovered  from his  possession on  25.5.1990,  was  to bolster up  a false  case against him under section 307 IPC, and the  weapon was  in fact  one which  was licenced in the name of  Avtar Singh, a partner of the appellant in a liquor business, and  was taken possesson of on 23.5.1990, to prove which Avtar  Singh was  examined  as  DW.1.  The  Designated Court, however,  regarded the  defence as ""an after thought"" because prosecution  witnesses had  not been asked about the same by  giving any suggestion to them in cross-examination. We are  afraid the Court made an apparent error in saying so inasmuch as  PW.1, SI  Gurinder Singh, who deposed about the recovery  of   the  arm   from  the   appellant,  had   been specifically asked  that the  rifle was licenced in the name of Avtar  Singh; and  PW.2, SI  Karnail Singh  was suggested that the  rifle in  question belonged to Avtar Singh and had taken possession  from him.  It is  a defferent  matter that these suggestions  were denied.  What is more, PW.2 admitted that in  the DDR  (Daily Diary  Report) there was no mention about details  of  the  case  property  recovered  from  the appellant. 2. Nothing  further was  required, according  to us,  to  be asked  to   the  prosecution   witnesses  and   the  learned Additional Judge  committed gross  error  in  rejecting  the aforesaid plea on the ground that it was ""an after thought"". 3.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI, J. The appellants who  were  the  purchasers  from  the landlord  have filed this appeal against the judgment of the High Court in write petition No. 799 of 1982. The respondent-Vithoba was the tenant of nine pieces of lands.    In  respect  of  five  lands,  proceedings were initiated under Section  32-G  of  the  Bombay  Tenancy  and Agricultural Lands  Act  in  the year 1962.  On the basis of the statement alleged to have been made  by  the  tenant  on 5.8.1962  expressing  his  unwillingness  to  purchase those lands, an order  was  cased  declaring  the  statutory  sale ineffective.  The landlord obtained possession of those five lands on  the  basis of the said order.  So far as the other four lands are concerned, there was no order  in  favour  of the  landlord and yet he took over possession of those lands also.  The tenant, therefore,  filed  an  application  under Section  84  of the Act for summary eviction of the landlord from those lands.  The Agriculture Lands Tribunal  dismissed the same on the ground that the proper remedy for the tenant was  to make and application under Section 29 of the Act and not under Section 84.  The appeal  against  that  order  was dismissed.   The  Revision  Application  made to the Revenue Tribunal was also dismissed.  The  High  Court  allowed  the writ  petition  on  the  ground  that  the  tenant  had  not surrendered his tenancy rights in respect of those lands and the landlord had not obtained possession thereof in a lawful manner.  Since the landlord was in  unauthorised  possession of  those  lands  as he had no right to retain the same, the application made by the tenant under  Section  84  was  held proper and maintainable. In our opinion, the  High  Court  was  justified  in reversing  the  orders of the authorities below and allowing the writ petition. The High  Court  was  also  justified  in passing  an order of eviction against the appellants as they had no right to retain possession of the  said  lands.

" J U D G M E N T [Arising out of SLP (C) No. 20161 of 2003] S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 447 in Sector 12, Gurgaon in the year 1986.  Even though all amounts had been deposited, the possession was not given to him. On 21st May 1996 he was offered an alternate plot in Sector 5, Gurgaon.  But an enhanced price was demanded from him. The Respondent thus filed a complaint. The District Forum by its Order dated 12th December 1997 directed the Appellants to deliver the alternate plot at the same price at which the original plot was allotted to him.  The District Forum directed the payment of interest @ 15% p.a.     The State Forum in the Appeal filed by the Appellants maintained the Order of the District Forum, save and except it directed that the interest would be payable after two years of the date of deposit.         The National Commission dismissed the revision on the ground of delay of 1727 days. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We are told that interest @ 15% has been paid on 3rd May 2000. We are informed that possession has already been delivered of the alternate plot on 30th December 2002.  In our view, the Order of the State Forum was just and equitable and requires no interference. Further, we also see no reason why the inordinate delay of 1727 days in filing the revision before the National Commission should be condoned.       We, therefore, dismiss the Appeal with no order as to costs. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.  The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.","A large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1116 of 1975. Appeal by  Special Leave  from the  Judgment and  order dated 21st  January, 1975  of the  High Court  of Madras  at Madras in Writ Petition No. 3962 of 1972. Petitioner in person; for the Appellant. A.  V.   Rangam  and  (Miss)  A.  Subhashini;  for  the Respondent. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAY, C.J.  This appeal  is by  special leave  from  the judgment dated 21 January, 1975 of the Madras High Court. The appellant  made an  application under  Article  226 challenging the  power of  the Government  of Tamil  Nadu to grant of  pension to  Anti-Hindi  agitators.  The  appellant further challenged  the power  of the  State to make payment from the Consolidated Fund of the State Exchequer. Article 351  of the  Constitution says that it shall be the duty  of the  Union Government  to promote the spread of the Hindi language to 602 develop so  that it  may serve as a medium of expression for all the  elements of  the composite  culture of our country. The appellant  contended  that  the  spirit  and  letter  of Article 351  is violated  by the Pension Scheme of the Tamil Nadu State.  The  appellant  said  that  the  agitators  who brought about  violence broke  the law  and were honoured by the pension scheme of the State. The High  Court said  that  the  Stat  Legislature  has control over  purse and  that  in  the  view  of  the  State Legislature the  agitators against  Hindi fought for a cause and, therefore,  those who  are eligible  should be  granted pension. The  High Court  found that  if a scheme is provide which is  not destructive  of the  Directive Principles  but aimed at  amelorating  those  who  the  legislature  thought deserve that treatment Article 351 was not violated. The High  Court found that because of Appropriation Act No. 38  of 1974  it could  not  be  said  that  payment  was illegal. In our  opinion the  pension scheme  formulated by  the Tamil Nadu  Government contains  the vice  of disintegration and fomenting  fissiparous tendencies.  If any State will be engaged in  exciting emotion  against  Hindi  or  any  other language such  provocation has  to  be  nipped  in  the  bud because  these   are   anti-national   and   anti-democratic tendencies. The Madras Budget Manual 4th Edition was referred to by the appellant.  The  appropriation in the present case shows that a fund was kept apart to meet the pension scheme. There is no  legislative sanction  for such  pension  scheme.  The Government by an executive order could not authorise payment of pension  scheme. The appellant is right in his contention that the  pension scheme  is unconstitutional and the budget sanction is equally unconstitutional. For these reasons the judgment of the High Court is set aside. A mandamus  will go directing the respondent to forbear from implementing  the pension  scheme. The  State  will  be competent  to   claim  refund   of  moneys   illegally   and unconstitutionally paid.  The appellant is entitled to costs to be paid by the State.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The  only   contention  raised   before   the   Central Administrative Tribunal  was  that  the  Divisional  Railway Manager,  Railways,   was  not   the  appointing  authority. Therefore, he  was not competent to impose the punishment of removal from  service. That  found favour with the Tribunal. Accordingly, the order of removal from service was set aside by the Tribunal in its order dated November 15, 1989. The controversy is no longer res integra. In Scientific Adviser to  the Ministry  of Defence and others v. s. Daniel and others  [1980 (2)  SCR  440],  a  bench  of  this  Court interpreted the  Rules in a common judgment. On a reading of Rule 2(a) and Rule 9 of the Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules,  it was  held that it would be impossible for the President  to deal  with all the disciplinary matters of the   Government   employees.   Therefore,   delegation   of appointment power  was  made  to  the  General  Manager  and disciplinary power  was delegated to the Divisional Manager. The General  Manager is not the delegator. Consequently, the doctrine that a delegator cannot further delegate his powers to the  delegatee has  no application.  As a  result, it was held that  the delegation  of power  to  impose  appropriate punishment is  permissible. Since  the ratio squarely covers the point  of controversy, we are of the view that the order of the Tribunal is clearly illegal. It is  next contended  that though  several contentions have been raised on merits, the Tribunal had only dealt with on this issue and, therefore, an opportunity may be given to the respondent  to agitate  those questions by remitting the matter to  the Tribunal. We find it difficult to accept this contention. It  is true that though several points appear to have  been   raised,  but   before  the  Tribunal  the  only contention argued  for the  respondent was  as extracted  in paragraph 4 of the order of the Tribunal. It says: ""The only point that was urged before us http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 by the learned counsel appearing for the applicant is that the Divisional Railway Manager   not   being   the   appointing authority is  not competent  to impose a punishment of  removal from  service  on the applicant who is a Travelling Ticker Examiner in  the pay  scale  of  Rs.425- 640."" Since the  controversy was only limited to this point before the Tribunal,  we do not find any justification to remit the matter. The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed  but   in   the circumstances without costs.","Divisional Railway Manager, Railways, was not the appointing authority. He was not competent to impose the punishment of removal from service. The controversy is no longer res integra.",appointment,42.56
" P. Venkatarama Reddi, J. Leave granted. In this appeal by Special leave, the only question that is canvassed before us is about the adequacy of compensation awarded by the High Court to the appellant  a minor, who was injured in a bus accident on 5.11.1994.  The bus belonged to the second respondent and  was insured with the 3rd respondent.  At the time of the accident the appellant  a student  was aged nine years.  The Motor  Accident Claim Tribunal, Ratlam, awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards compensation with interest at the rate of 12% p.a.  from the date of petition.  On appeal, the High Court enhanced the compensation to Rs.35,000/-.  A letters Patent Appeal filed against that order, was summarily dismissed by the impugned order dated 8.7.1999.  The amount of compensation awarded by the High Court under different heads is as follows :- On account of disablity suffered by the victim as a result of grievous injury caused to his right hand Rs.20,000/- (increased by Rs.5,000/-). For pain and suffering Rs.5,000/- (increased by Rs.1,500/-). Travel and stay expenses of the victim and his attendant for going to Baroda for treatment Rs.5,000/-. It is contended that the compensation awarded under the first head is too low having regard to the nature and gravity of injury.  The evidence of medical experts (PWs 3 to 5) discloses that three bones of the appellant were fractured and surgery had to be performed. According to P.W.5, an orthopaedic expert,  appellant’s right hand became irregular in shape and its movement became restrained and he cannot lift heavy articles with the right hand.  The normal movement will be painful.  However, the disability sustained was assessed at 20 per cent.  As rightly observed by the High Court, the loss of earning capacity on account of permanent partial disability suffered by the appellant cannot be calculated in terms of percentage only.  It will have serious repercussions on his studies and prospects of earning. He will have to  face other handicaps in life.  Though the High Court did realise the need to enhance the compensation, we feel that the extent of enhancement is still inadequate.  The increase of Rs.5,000/- is only marginal.   Taking inter alia the table in the 2nd Schedule as guiding factor, we are of the view that the compensation on account of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 disability incurred by the appellant should be enhanced by Rs.20,000/- more; that means, he will get Rs.40,000/- instead of Rs.20,000/- awarded by the High Court under the first head.  In respect of other items, the award as modified by the High Court remains undisturbed. In all, the appellant shall get Rs.50,000/-.  This amount should carry interest at the rate and from the period specified by the High Court. The other directions in the award of the Tribunal shall stand. Thus the appeal is partly allowed.

Krishna Prasad, Advocates with him for the appellant. Mr.  Roy  Abraham  and  Mr.M.M.Kashyap,  Advocates  for  the respondent. J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the court was delivered: KIRPAL, J. In these  appeals by  certificate granted by the Karala High Court,  the following question of law has been referred in respect of the assessment year 1978-79:- ""Whether, the Tribunal was right in law in  holding that  the statutory deduction  under   Section  36  (i) (viii) of the I.T. Act, 1961 should be calculated  on the  total income before  deduction   of  the  amount allowable under the section?"" The Kerala  High Court  came to  the conclusion that in computing the total income for the purpose of Section 36 (1) (viii) of  the Income Tax Act, 1961, the total income has to be computed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 30 to 43A  except Section  36 (i)  (viii). In  arriving at this decision, the  High Court  relied upon  the observations  of this Court in Cambay Electric Supply Industrial Co. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, (1978) 113 ITR 84. The view  which was  taken by the Kerala High Court was in consonance with the view taken by the Patna High Court in three decisions,  Madhya Pradesh High Court in two decisions and Kerala  High Court  itself in an earlier decision. It is stated that  sudsequent to  the decision under appeal, other High  Courts  have  also  taken  the  same  view.  The  only dissenting view which has been expressed is by the Karnataka High Court  in Karnataka  State  Financial  Corporation  vs. Commissiner of Income Tax. (1988) 174 ITR 203. Having gone through the decisions cited at the cited at the Bar.  We find that the decision the High Court following http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 its earlier  decision in  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  vs. Kerala State  Industrial Development  Corproration Ltd. (No. 2). (1990)  182 ITR  67, is  une ceptionble.  The Karanataka High Court  has tried  to work out the sub-section the basis of  a  mathematical  formula  and  has  dissented  from  the decision of  the Patna  High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Bihar  vs. Bihar State Financial Corporation (1983) 142 ITR 518. It may hare be mentioned that Civil Appeal No. 3695 of 1982  against the  aforesaid judgment reported in 142 ITR 518 was  desmissed by  this  Court  on  20th  January,  1995 thereby affiraming  the view of the Patna High Court. It may here be  noticed that  not only  the  preponderance  of  the judicial opinion  of the various High Courts is in line with the view expressed by the Kerala High Court but the relevant sub-clause (viii)  of Section  36(1) has  subsequently  been amended so as to bring it in line with the view of the Patna and Kerala  High Courts.  The decision of the Karnataka High Court does  not appear  to be  correct being contrary to the aforesaid decisions  of the  Patna High  Court which  stands affirmed by  its affirmation by  this Court on 20th January, 1995. The  view of  the other  High Courts  is in consonance with relevant  provisions of  the Act.  We, therefore, agree with the  deciaion  of  the  High  Court  in  answering  the question of  law in  the affiramative  and in  favour of the assessee. The appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.","The Kerala High Court held that the total income for the purpose of Section 36 (1) (viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has to be computed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 30 to 43A.

Narasimhmurthy, Novin Singh and M. Veerappa for the Appellants. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH  MISRA.  CJ. The appeal is by  special  leave.

Respondent,  an excise contractor, had taken in auction  the exclusive privilege tosell liquors in retail at an  approved shop premises. ’He was issued the appropriate licence  under the provisions of the law on payment of licence fee in terms of  Item 2 of Rule 8(1) of the aforesaid  Rules.  Respondent filed a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court  chal- lenging the vires of s. 23(d) of the Mysore Excise Act, 1965 (hereafter  ’Act’ for short) and Rule 8(1.) as being  beyond the  legislative  competence of,the State  Legislature.  The High  Court did not accept the contention of the  respondent in ’regard to s. 23 but held that Rule 8(1)-authorising  the ’levy  of a licence fee for the retail off shop was  without authority of law. Section 23(d), as far as relevant, provides: ""23. Ways of levying such duties-- Subject  to  such Rules regulating  the  time, place and manner, as may be prescribed, excise duty and countervailing duty under section  22 shall be levied in one or more of the  follow- ing ways, as may be prescribed, namely: 702 (a) ............. (aa) ...................... (b) .......................... (c)............................ (d)by fees on licences in respect of manufacture   or   sale   of   any   excisable articles.""

The  High Court rightly did not accept the challenge  to  s. 23(d)  of  the  Act. What is authorised under  s.  23(d)  is imposition  of  a fee of  licence in respect of  manufacture or  sale of any excisable articles. Rule 8(1) has  obviously gone beyond the enabling provision in the section by requir- ing  a  licence fee to be paid for the  premises  where  the licence  shop  is  located. Such a fee would  not  have  the support  of s. 23(d). It is unnecessary to refer  to  prece- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 dents  for support for this  conclusion. It may be  possible for  the  Legislature to make a statutory  provision  for  a licence  fee of the type contemplated under the  Rules   but without authority of the statute a rule of the type impugned should  not have been made. We find no merit in this  appeal and it is, therefore, diismissed. fore, dismissed. Respondent  did not appear inspite of service of  appeal notice. We make no of for costs.

" ORDER ORDER 1.   Delay condoned. 2.   Notice  was given for final disposal of the  matter  at this  stage.  Leave granted.  Both sides have been heard  on merits. 3.The respondent was employed as a Technician in the Post and  Telegraph  Department  of the Union  of  India.   While working  in  that  capacity, the  respondent  assaulted  his superiors  including an Engineering Supervisor for which  he was prosecuted.  The respondent was convicted of the offence punishable  under  Section 332 IPC and  the  conviction  was maintained up to the High Court.  Thereafter, the respondent was compulsorily retired by an order dated 10-5-1982  passed by the Divisional Engineer (Phones), Varanasi after +  Arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 7611 of 1993 397 giving   him   a  show-cause  notice   and   the   requisite opportunity.   The  respondent  has been  paid  the  retiral benefits on his compulsory retirement. 4.The respondent challenged his compulsory retirement  by filing  a suit in the Court of City Munsiff, Varanasi  which was  transferred  to the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal, Allahabad Bench.  By the impugned order dated 3-9-1992,  the transferred   case  has  been  allowed  and  the  order   of compulsory  retirement of the respondent has  been  quashed. However,  the  tribunal has not awarded back  wages  to  the respondent.   The respondent had preferred a  special  leave petition challenging the tribunal’s order refusing the  back wages to him but that SLP has already been dismissed.   This appeal by special leave is by the Union of India against the tribunal’s  order quashing the compulsory retirement of  the respondent. 5.The  undisputed  facts of this case are  sufficient  to indicate  that there can be no ground for  interfering  with the  compulsory retirement of the respondent who appears  to have been dealt with lightly notwithstanding his  conviction under Section 332 IPC for assaulting his superior  officers. The  compulsory  retirement  made  in  these   circumstances together  with grant of all retiral benefits was  the  least action  which could have been taken against the  respondent. The tribunal clearly misunderstood the scope of its power in a  case like this and clearly erred in interfering with  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 order  of  compulsory retirement on grounds  which,  in  our opinion,  were  not available to it.  The  tribunal’s  order has,  therefore, to be set aside, insofar as it quashes  the order of compulsory retirement of the respondent. 6.Consequently,  the  appeal is  allowed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2438 OF 2006 This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.10.2003 passed by the High Court dismissing the appellant’s writ petition and the Special Appeal. Brief facts leading to the filing of this appeal are as follows : The appellant was appointed on temporary basis. This is not disputed. By an order dated 16.06.1997 several charges were levelled against him. A show cause notice was thereupon issued to him to be replied within 15 days.  Show cause notice was replied by the appellant by letter dated 30.06.1997 that is within 15 days’ time. Curiously enough, the enquiry report was submitted on 27.06.1997 even before the show cause reply was received.  Thereafter, the appellant’s service was done away with by order dated 22.8.1997. In a democratic country like ours governed by the rule of law such arbitrary action of the respondent cannot be said to be passed in accordance with law. The procedure adopted by the respondents is unknown to the law. On the other hand, the appellant’s termination order dated 22.08.1997 is not a termination simplicitor.  We have been taken through the order of termination.  In the order of termination the entire facts leading to the filing of the charges of embezzlement alleged to have been committed by the appellant has been recited. Therefore, the order of termination cannot be treated as simplicitor but it is by way of punitive action recording stigma on the conduct of the appellant.  In such a situation it is a bounden duty to hold an inquiry when opportunity could have been afforded to the appellant in terms of Article 311(2) of the Constitution. But in the instant case as already noticed the enquiry report was submitted even before the receipt of the show cause reply by the appellant.  Even if the charge was framed and the enquiry report was submitted,  the respondents could have terminated the services of the appellant by way of a termination simplicitor without stigma,  because the appellant was a temporary employee. This has not been done in the present case. In the result, the order of  termination cannot be said to be order of termination simplicitor.  The order of termination dated 22.08.1997 is accordingly set aside.  The orders of Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court are  set aside. The writ petition of the appellant stands allowed.  Consequently, this appeal is allowed. No costs. We, however, give liberty to the respondent to initiate a fresh inquiry, if so advised.

The courts have also  held that  injuries were  caused  to  Brijlal  in furtherance  of  the  common  intention  of  all  the  three accused.    The  reason  why  the  High  Court  altered  the conviction of  Raj Nath Singh from that under Section 34 IPC is that  according to  the evidence of Dr. C.B. Tripathi who had held  the post  martem examination  8  injuries  on  the person of  the deceased  were medically interferred with and the death  was caused  due to  pus in  the brain.   The High Court was,  therefore, of the view that the death of Brijlal was not  the direct  result of  the injuries  caused by  the accused. What is  contended us  by the  learned counsel  for the appellant is  that in  view of  the said finding recorded by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the High  Court the  appellant Raj  Nath Singh  could not be convicted under  Section 326  read with  Section 34 IPC.  We are of  the opinion  that the said finding of the High Court is not  correct.   Nothing was  brought  out  in  the  cross examination of  the doctor  to indicate  that  any  external factor had  contributed to  the formation  of pus justifying the view that the death of Brijlal was not the direct result of the  injuries caused  to him by the accused.  That apart, what we  find is  that Dr.  Rajendra  Singh  (P.W.  12)  has clearly stated  in his  evidence that injury which was found on the  abdomem of Brijlal was a grievous injury and on that evidence alone conviction of the appellant under SECTION 326 read with  Section 34  IPC is  justified.  As we do not find any error  in the  judgment of the High Court this appeal is dismissed.   The appellant  is on bail.  So he is ordered to surrender to  custody to  serve out the remaining portion of his sentence.",The two appellants in this appeal were convicted by the trial court   along with  accused Bishwanath  Singh for committing the offence punishable under Section  302  read with Section  34 IPC. In the appeal filed by them the High Court altered  their conviction  from under Section 302 read with Sections 34 and 326. The High Court was of the view that the death of Brijlal was not the direct result of the injuries caused by the accused.,special leave petitions,28.8
" JUDGMENT SANTOSH HEGDE, J. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. In this matter, we had directed the release of the appellant on bail as per order dated 25th of April, 2003.  On 6th of May, 2003, we were informed that the appellant was not yet released on bail, therefore, on that date, we directed the matter to be listed the next day and called upon the respondent to explain the delay in giving effect to the bail order.  On 8.5.2003, Sub-Inspector Amal Tyagi of Gokulpuri Police Station, appeared before the Court and submitted that his police station has nothing to do with the release of the appellant, as directed by this Court.  Therefore, we directed the matter to be listed on 11th of July, 2003.  In the said order, we also directed the Superintendent, Central Jail of Tihar No. II to be personally present in the Court.  On 11.7.2003, we called upon the said officer to explain the delay in giving effect to the bail order.  We also called upon the Union Territory, namely, State (in City of Delhi) to file its response. From the response filed by the said officers, it is seen that the order made by this Court on 25th of April, 2003 was received in Central Jail of Tihar No. II only on 1.5.2003 and immediately on receipt of the same, the appellant was informed to furnish the required bond with a surety.  It is on his furnishing such surety, the Trial Court, namely, the Additional Sessions Judge issued a release order on 7.5.2003. Consequent to which the appellant has been released thereafter. Though, in this case, there has been noticeable delay in the release of the appellant in spite of the bail granted by this Court, the same is due to the procedure involved in giving effect to the bail order made by this Court and not due to any individual’s laxity. We place on record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by Shri Vijay Panjwani, learned Advocate of this Court as Amicus Curiae in the above matter.  He shall be paid a fee of Rs.750/-. For the reasons stated above, this appeal is disposed of. + 5 1823 1998","In this matter, we had directed the release of the appellant on bail as per order dated 25th of April, 2003.

" JUDGMENT Nanavati.J. This appeal is  filed  by  the  tenant  against  the judgment  and or der dated 3.8.1990 passed by the High Court of Bombaly in Writ Petition No. 95 of 1980. The Agricultural Lands Tribunal, The deputy District Collector  in  appeal  and  the Revenue Tribunal in revision have held that the tenant had made a statement on  13.1.1965 stating  that  he  was not willing to purchase the land and, therefore, the purchase  under  Section  32  of  the  Bombay Tenancy  and  Agricultural Lands Act had become ineffective. After the purchase was declared ineffective, the tenant made an application declaring that he wants to purchase the land. That application was dismissed  by  the  Agricultural  Lands Tribunal as not maintainable.  Another application was moved by the  tenant  on  12.1.1967.    That was also dismissed on 13.3.1967 for the same reason.   Again  an  application  was made  by  the  tenant  on 15.2.1968 stating therein that the statement dated 13.1.1965 was not voluntarily  made  by  him and  in any case it was not conclusive as it was not made on oath.  He also alleged that no  notice  regarding  statutory purchase of  the land was received by him.  This application was rejected by  the  Agricultural  Lands  Tribunal  on  the ground  that  at  that stage evidence could be led only with respect to the proceeding under Section 32-P of the Act  and no evidence could be led to question the order passed in the 32-G proceedings.  The Tribunal than held that the statutory sale  in  favour of the tenant having become ineffective the landlord was entitled to be put in possession of the land. This decision of the Tribunal was upheld  in  appeal and also in the revision application. As  all the authorities have, after appreciating the material on record, come to the conclusion that the sale had become  ineffective  and  the  landlord  was   entitled   to possession  of  the  land under Section 32-P of the Act, the High Court was right in dismissing the writ petition.   This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.","This appeal is filed by the tenant against the judgment  and or der dated 3.8.1990 passed by the High Court of Bombaly in Writ Petition No. 95 of 1980.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NO.220 OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 8077/2006) Dr.AR.LAKSHMANAN, J. Leave granted. Heard Mr.T.L.V.Iyer, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr.R.Sathish, learned counsel for the respondents. This appeal is directed against the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court dt.13.12.2005 in C.R.P.No.1177 of 2005. Before the High Court, it was submitted by the appellant herein (D.Gopinathan Pillai) that the delay in filing an application for setting aside the award was only 30 days and there was absolutely no explanation for the inordinate delay of 3320 days in filing the appeal. The High Court without going into the merits of the delay petition  has, however, observed that the application to set aside the award is ultimately dismissed then the appellant cannot be said to be aggrieved and that if the said petition is ultimately allowed and the arbitral award passed in favour of the appellant is set aside then his remedy is to file an appeal under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and that the appellant can challenge the impugned order in that appeal, in case, the petition to set aside the award happened to be decided against the appellant.  Reserving the said right to the appellant, the Civil Revision Petition was dismissed by the High Court. Our attention was also drawn to the order passed by the Principal Sub Judge, Thiruvananthapuram dt.30.09.2005 in I.A.No.1309/2005 in O.P.(Arb.) 78/1995 which was filed by the State of Kerala against the appellant herein.  The court has considered whether the delay of 3320 days in filing the petition to set aside the award can be condoned.  We have perused the entire order.  However, without assigning any acceptable reason, Principal Sub Judge, Thiruvananthapuram has condoned the inordinate delay of 3320 days and allowed the I.A. filed by the State of Kerala.  While condoning the delay, the learned Sub Judge has also observed that the officers of the State of Kerala has committed gross negligence in not filing the objection for a long period of 3320 days and, therefore, for the fault of the officers, the State should not be penalised. We are unable to countenance the finding rendered by the Sub Judge and also the view taken by the High Court.  There is no dispute in regard to the delay of 3320 days in filing the petition for setting aside the award.  When a mandatory provision is not complied with and when the delay is not properly, satisfactorily and convincingly explained, the court cannot condone the delay, only on the sympathetic ground. The orders passed by the learned Sub Judge and also by the High Court are far from satisfactory.  No reason whatsoever has been given to condone the inordinate delay of 3320 days.  It is well-considered principle of law that the delay cannot be condoned without assigning any reasonable, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 satisfactory, sufficient and proper reason.  Both the courts have miserably filed to comply and follow the principle laid down by this Court in catena of cases.  We, therefore, have no other option except to set aside the order passed by the Sub-Judge and as affirmed by the High Court.  We accordingly set aside both the orders and allow this appeal. No costs.","This appeal is directed against the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court dt.13.12.2005 in C.R.P.No.1177 of 2005.

" O R D E R These appeals  by special leave arise from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Kerala  High  Court  in  O.P Nos.868/77 and 4934/76. The admitted position is that Smt. Mary Lily, the third respondent, was temporarily appointed in a leave vacancy for a period  of three  months effective from January 2, 1974 in St. Joseph’s  College for  Women ,  Irinjalakuda, After  the expiry of  the period, she ceased to be a Lecturer. In 1976, when a  permanent vacancy  hay arisen advertisement was made for  recruitment.   Pursuant  thereto,  when  27  candidates including the  third respondent  had applied  for and called for  selection   therein  Smt.   Mariamma   Chacko,   fourth respondent was selected. The third respondent challenged the validity of  the selection  and appointment of Smt. Mariamma on  the   ground  that  under  Section  57  (6)  of  Calicut University  Act,   1975,  she  had  preferential  claim  for appointment since she was a discharged employee. Sub-section (6) of Section  57 reads as under: ""Notwithstanding anything contained in  sub-sections   (i)  and  (4)  a teacher discharged  from a  private college on or after the 14th day of March, 1974,  due to abolition of a course of  study in that college or for   any   other   reason   except disciplinary  action   against  him shall be  given  reference  in  the matter of  future  appointments  in the private college or, as the case may  be,  or  any  of  the  private colleges under  the  management  of the educational  agency within  the university     area.""     (emphasis supplied) A reading  thereof would  indicate that notwithstanding anything contained  in sub-section  (i)  and  Section  4  of Section 57,  a teacher  discharged from a private college on or after  March 14,  1974 due  to abolition  of a  course of course of  study in  college for  any other reason except on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 disciplinary action  against him,  shall be given preference in further  appointments in  a private college or any of the private colleges  under the  Management of  the  educational agency within  the university  area. Admittedly,  the  third respondent was  appointed in  a leave  vacancy for  a  short period of  three months.  The intendment  of sub-section (6) appears to  be only  that when  permanent teacher or teacher appointed on  a regular basis is discharged from service due to abolition  of the  course of study in that college or for any other  reason, obviously,  other analogous  causes other then disciplinary  action, such  a teacher who held the post was given  preferential treatment  for future appointment. A temporary teacher in a leave vacancy cannot be considered as discharged not  claimed the  status as  discharged employee. Discharge would  connote  for  any  other  reason  ujus  dem generis due  to abolition  of the post or course of study or such similar  circumstances  except  for  discharge  due  to misconduct. Such  a teacher  only will be eligible to set up preferential claim  for appointment  but not  a teacher  who fortuitously came  to be  appointed in  a leave vacancy much less for a limited period.

O R D E R Notification  under  Section  36  of  the  Punjab  Town Improvement Act,  1922 was  published on  September 14, 1975 acquiring an  extent of  124 Kanals  3 marlas of the land in Kapurthala Town  for Kapurthala  Development Scheme  No.  2. Notification under  Section 42  of the  Act was published on August 6, 1976. The Collector in his award dated October 12, 1976 classified  the lands into three belts ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ and granted  compensation @ Rs. 300/-and Rs.360/- and Rs.210 - per marla respectively. On reference under Section 18, the Tribunal by  its award  dated April 16, 1981 awarded uniform rate of  compensation at  Rs. 540/-  per  marla.  When  writ petitions came  to be  filed under Article 226, the Division Bench of  the High Court by its common order on February 23, 1982 dismissed them. Thus these appeals by special leave. Shri S.K.  Mehta, learned  counsel  appearing  for  the Kapurthala Improvement Trust, contended that having rejected all the sale transactions, the Tribunal was not justified in awarding  uniform  market  rate  since  the  Collector  made belting  and  that  different  rates  were  awarded  by  the Collector. We  have seen  the plan which would indicate that the lands are situated in a triangle bounded by roads on all the three  sides. The  lands are situated in developed area. In our  considered opinion,  the Tribunal  had not committed any error  of law  in determining  the compensation  for the acquired land.  Therefore, the  appeals of  the  Improvement Trust as  well as  of the  claimants for further enhancement stand dismissed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh made on July 9, 1996 in CRP No.4290/95. The matter arises under Section 10(2) (1) of the A.P. Buildings  (Lease, Rent.  and  Eviction)  Control  Act, 1960. The  principal ground  for eviction ordered by all the three courts  below is  that  the  appellant  has  committed willful default in the payment of the rent from the month of June 1990 till October 31, 1990. The contention  of Shri  Subba Rao, learned counsel for the appellant,  is that  the respondent landlord was staying in Hyderabad  and  the  power  of  attorney  holder  is  his brother-in-law-cum-maternal uncle  and that  whenever he was coming  to   Madanpalle,  he   was  paying  the  rents  and, therefore, there  is a  contract to the contrary. We find no substance in  the contention.  Though parties  are  related, nonetheless when the appellant is staying in the premises as tenant, he  has got an obligation to pay the rent regularly. If he  does not  do so,  he commits  willful default.  If he finds that  the landlord  is evading  the payment  of  rent, procedure has  been prescribed under Section 8 of the Act to issue notice to the landlord to name the bank and if he does not name  the bank,  the tenant  has to  file an application before the  Rent Controller  for permission  to deposit  the rents The  appellant did  not  avail  of  that  remedy.  The omission to avail of the procedure under Section 11 does not disentitle  the   landlord  to  seek  eviction  for  willful default. The appeal  is accordingly  dismissed.  However,  three months time from today is granted to the appellant to vacate the premises  on his giving an usual undertaking within four weeks from today.

" Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice D.P. Wadhwa Anil Kumar Tandale, Adv. for the appellant O R D E R The following order of theCourt was delivered: This appeal  by special  leave arises fromthe order of the Andhra  Pradesh Administrative  Tribunal,  Hyderabad  in R.P. No.767/81, made on  June 26,  1985. The  Tribunal has allowedthe representation petition, solely on the ground of defaulton  thepart  of the  appellantto filethe counter- affidavit. Therein  they had  claimed the  benefit of graded increments depending  upon the length of service in terms of G.O.Ms.No.41,Financeand  Planning (in Wing.PRC-I) dated 4.2.1980. The admitted  position isthat  the  respondentswere workingin  thepost ofSenior Assistant Grade-II in the pay scale of Rs. 200-240/-.They were promoted to Grade-I in the scale of  Rs. 430-800/-.  The Government  passed an order in G.O.Ms.No.  235, dated September 7,  1979, effectivefrom April 1,  1978,granting  the revised  pay scales. As stated earlier, G.O.Ms.  No. 41,  Fin., dated4.2.1980  gives the benefitas under : ""Weightage for   servicein   the existing post  or categoryshall be asfollows in therevisedscale of pay, 1978. (i) All  employeesin Gr. I to XVII shall be  allowed one increment for service of three years  and  above upto five years, two increments for service of five  years  and  above upto seven years,three increments for service  of service seven years and above."" The question,  therefore, is  : whether the respondents are entitled tohave their entire previous service as Trade- II teacher  lagged to  count the advance increments in terms of G.O.Ms.  No.41,  referred to  earlier.  Itspecifically envisages ""weightage  of service  in the  existing  post  or http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 category"". It  would indicate  that the weightage  for the servicerendered  in the  existing postor category in which they are  working shall be taken  intoaccount in terms of G.O.Ms.No.  41. In  other words, if Grade-I teacher remains in Grade-I service evenafter putting in five years service, he is  entitledto  oneincrement; after five to seven years service, he  entitled to  two increments; and for service of seven years andabove, he is entitled to there increments as outer limit.

" ORDER 1.   By  a  notification  under Section  4(1)  of  the  Land Acquisition Act, 1894 published in the Tamil Nadu Gazette on 7-3-1973  a large extent of lands including Survey No.  11/4 and 49/7 in Thathanai Village, near Madurai were proposed to be  acquired  for a Housing Scheme.   The  Land  Acquisition Officer determined the market value of that land @ Rs 92 per cent.   On reference under Section 18, the civil  court,  by its award, enhanced the market value of that land to Rs  800 per  cent as against the claim of the appellant at the  rate of  Rs 1500 per cent.  The High Court, by its  judgment  and decree  dated  25-10-1989 confirmed the award of  the  civil court  and dismissed the appeal in Civil Appeal No.  763  of 1987  of the State.  It also dismissed the  cross-objections of the appellant.  Hence, this claimant’s appeal by  special leave. 2.   It  is  not  disputed that the market  value  of  lands acquired   pursuant  to  ’he  said  notification  has   been determined  by different Benches of the High Court  such  as Appeal  Nos.  538 of 1987 and 1226 of  1986  titled  Special Tehsildar,  Land Acquisition v. Lakshmi Ammall.   The  lands for  which the and Acquisition.  Officer had awarded at  the rate of Rs 70 per cent and the civil court on reference, had enhanced  such  rate to Rs 850 per cent, the High  Court  on appeal  had  enhanced the rate in two cases to Rs  1000  per cent and in two other cases to Rs 1050 per cent.  Since  the lands  under  consideration  in  the  present  appeals   are situated  in the same area and were acquired under ,he  same acquisition  and  the Land Acquisition Officer  himself  had treated  the lands to be in a better  advantageous  position than  the  lands covered in the other appeals, it  would  be clear  that  the  lands in these appeals  are  possessed  of better  advantageous features than the lands covered by  the judgment in other appeals by fixing their value at the  rate of Rs 92 per cent.  This fact was not noticed by the learned Judge,  while  disposing of the appeals, as it  is  observed http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that  there is no evidence as to parity of the  advantageous position  of the lands to award the same compensation.   The observation  appears to be incorrect.  The treatment of  the lands by the Land Acquisition Officer himself by awarding to them a rate of Rs 92 per cent in these appeals while he  had awarded  the  rate of Rs 70 per cent of lands in  the  other appeals  furnishes the intrinsic evidence that the lands  in question are situated in a better advantageous position than the lands concerned in the other appeals.  When such is  the situation the appellant also is entitled to parity of market value for the acquired lands. 3.   The appeals are accordingly allowed.  The appellant  is entitled  to  30% solatium and 9% interest on  the  enhanced compensation  for  the first year from the  date  of  taking possession and thereafter 15% interest till date of  payment or deposit, whichever is earlier.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(Civil) No. 2901/2002) K.G. Balakrishnan, J. Leave granted. The claimants in a motor accident claim are appellants before us.  They are the legal heirs of one Rajashekhar Kasture who died in a motor accident. The deceased Rajashekhar Kasture was aged about 24 years at the time of his death.  He was employed as a Munim in Avinash and Co.  On 20.7.1996, when he was travelling in a lorry to bring sugar for his employer, the lorry met with an accident and he fell down and died on the spot. The claimants preferred claim contending that he was the only earning member and was earning Rs. 3000/- p.m.  The respondent No. 2 namely, the lorry owner contended that the deceased was working only as a office boy and was having a salary of Rs. 600/- p.m.  To support his plea, RW1, the owner of the company was also examined.  The Tribunal after considering the evidence on either side held that the salary of the deceased must have been around Rs. 1200/- p.m.  and by deducting 1/3rd for his personal expenses, the monthly dependency of the claimants must have been Rs. 800/- p.m.  Taking the annual income as Rs. 9600/-, the total compensation was fixed at Rs. 1,53,600/- and an award was passed in favour of the claimants.  Aggrieved by the same, the second respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court of Karnataka and the High Court reduced the compensation to Rs. 81,600/- under the heading ’loss of dependancy’. The Judgment of the High Court is challenged before us. We heard learned Counsel on either side.  The High Court considered the evidence of RW1, the partner of the Avinash and Company with whom the deceased was employed.  RW1 deposed that the monthly salary of the deceased was Rs. 600/-.  RW1 had chosen to produce some receipts purportedly signed by the deceased but he cleverly withheld the salary register maintained by the company for the relevant period.  The receipts were not originally produced but later he produced them and the Tribunal rightly declined to take note of the same.  During the time of cross-examination, he admitted that the persons who were similarly employed were being paid Rs. 1,500/- p.m.  It is also difficult to believe that the company would employ a person with such a meagre amount of Rs. 600/- p.m.  It may also be noticed that the company under the management of RW1 was having 4 to 5 lorries and about 30 workers were employed under them.  He must have been keeping some documents in respect of payment of salary to his workers but such documents were not produced.  The Tribunal had considered the evidence in detail and came to a rational conclusion regarding the income of the deceased.  The learned Single Judge without considering the evidence of RW1 simply brushed aside the whole evidence and accepted the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 statement of RW1 solely on the ground that the employer himself had spoken regarding the salary and it must have been taken as correct.  This approach made by the High Court is not at all justified having regard to the entire facts and circumstances of the case.   The High Court, on flimsy reasons, interfered with the award passed by the Tribunal. The compensation awarded by the Tribunal was just and reasonable. In the result, we allow the appeal preferred by the claimants and set aside the Judgment of the learned Single Judge.  If the appellants have not been paid the amount, the same shall be paid as directed in the award  by the Tribunal within two months.  There will be no order as to costs.","Rajashekhar Kasture was aged about 24 years at the time of his death. He was employed as a Munim in Avinash and Co.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appellant-State  is challenging  in this appeal the interim order  passed by the High Court in writ petition No. 2029/97. By  the said  order the  High  Court  directed  the Collector to  remove  encroachments  and  report  compliance within 72  hours. It  was submitted  by the  learned counsel appearing for the State that considering the large number of persons on  the land  and the  fact that they are all hutmen dwellers it  is not  possible to  remove them as directed by the Court  within 72 hours and therefore the direction given by the  High Court  should be quashed as it is unreasonable. We find considerable substance in this contention. It should have been  appreciated that  high  handed  removal  of  such persons would  not only  create a  law and order problem but also a  humanitarian problem  as they have no other place to stay. In  such cases  the court  should be  more careful and reasonable while  giving directions  to the  authorities. It was not  possible for  Mr. U.U.  Lalit to support this order and the  only submission  which he  could make  was that the Collector  should have been directed to remove encroachments within some  reasonable time. The impugned order of the High Court is,  therefore, set  aside, we,  direct the Government and its  officers to decide as early as possible whether the land is  to be  restored to  the respondent or it intends to put it  to any  other public  purpose. In  case  it  is  not required by  the State for any other public purpose then the Government and  its officers  are directed to take steps for removing the encroachments within reasonable time.

" J U D G M E N T (arising out of SLP(C)No.21143 of 2003) Dr. AR . Lakshmanan, J. Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 31.3.2003 passed by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.9346 of 2001.  The prayer before the High Court by the respondent herein was that his services in Tinsukia Degree College, Assam as Hindi Lecturer be added to the services rendered at Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith, Varanasi for calculating to his post retiral benefits.  The learned counsel for the petitioner before the High Court relied upon a Division Bench decision of Lucknow Bench of the said court in the case of Dr. Shankar Sahai Srivastava versus State of U.P.& ors. decided on 7.12.1999.  The Division Bench of the High Court following the said decision allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent herein and directed that the respondent’s service in Tinsukia Degree College, Assam shall be added to his service rendered in  Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith, Varanasi.  A further direction was given to the authorities to refix the pension within two months and the arrears of his pension be paid within the same period. Our attention was also drawn to the order passed by the Allahabad High Court in Dr. Shankar Sahai Srivastava versus State of U.P.& ors.  The said order dated 7.12.1999 reads thus: ""LUCKNOW                        Dated : 7.12.1999 Hon’ble M. Katju, J. Hon’ble U.K. Dhaon, J. Heard.

He is claiming that his earlier services in other Institutions   be  added   to his service in Kashi Vidyapith. We dispose of this Writ Petition which the direction  that petitioner’s pension be recalculated in accordance with statute 15.05 of Kashi Vidyapith within two months of production of certified copy of this order http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 before the authority concerned.  Payment will be made accordingly to the recalculation.""] A perusal of the said order would show that there was absolutely no discussion by the Bench as to why the said direction in regard to the petitioner’s pension was issued.  The order, in our opinion, is non-speaking. Aggrieved by the said order, the State of U.P. & ors preferred special leave petition before this Court, which was dismissed by this Court on 27.9.2000 on the ground of delay in approaching this Court.  The special leave petition was not disposed of by this Court on merit.  In the impugned order also, except adopting the reason given by the order dated 7.12.1999, no other reason was given by the Division Bench.  Before us,  several legal contentions have been raised by Dr. R.G. Padia, learned Senior Counsel for the State and also countered by Mr. Rohan Thanavi, learned counsel for the respondent.  In our opinion, the matter required detailed investigation with reference to Section 33 of the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973 and also with reference to the General Order issued under reference no.2148/Pandrah/15/1983-46(14)/83 dated 24.12.1983.  In our view, Regulation 15.05 of the Statute of the University is also required to be considered for determining the claim of the respondent herein.  We, therefore, remit the matter to the High Court and restore the Civil Misc. Writ Petition no.9346 of 2001 and request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition within six months from the date of production of copy of order of this Court by either party. In view of the remittal order now passed by us, we set aside the order dated 31.3.2003 passed in  Civil Misc. Writ Petition no.9346 of 2001.

" O R D E R It is  stated in  the judgment  of the  learned  single Judge of the High Court at page 4 and 5 thus: ""When the  matter was argued before me, I  was of  the opinion that the measurements had  not been taken by the  Tehsildar   and  the   Revenue Patwari in accordance with the well set  rules  of  procedure  in  this behalf.  Consequently,   with   the consent of the parties, I passed an order  appointing   another   Local Commissioner i.e. Tehsildar Kasauli and issued  certain  directions  to him to  go to  the spot and measure the site in dispute and to submit a report in  detail. This  order  was passed on  20th May,  1996 and this judgement be  read in  continuation of  that  order,  it  may  also  be noticed  at  this  stage  that  the parties before  me  had  undertaken that they  will abide by the report to  be   submitted  by   the  Local Commissioner  and   no   objections would be  filed before  this  Court against that.  The  report  of  the Local   Commissioner    has    been received by  this court  in  sealed cover  which   was  ordered  to  be opened  in   the  presence  of  the learned counsel  appearing for  the parties.  This   report  is  hereby marked as  Ex.C-1 and it shall from part of the record."" On perusal  of the  report, the  High Court  has stated thus: ""It is  also there  in  the  report that  the  appellant-defendant  was unable to  substantiate  his  claim http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that   there   was   old   existing building on the disputed site which he  alleges   to   have   purchased through the  registered sale  deed.

" O R D E R A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act (for short,  ’the Act’)  was published  on October  6,  1975 acquiring  Ac.   7.14  cents  of  land  near  Bangalore  for Agriculture University.  Pursuant to  the notice  under ss.9 and 10.  the respondents claimed compensation at the rate of Rs.  60,000/-  per  acre.  The  Land  Acquisition  Collector awarded compensation  for the agriculture land to the extent of Ac.5.20  cents, @  Rs.12,000/- per acre and for Ac. 1.34, he awarded @ Rs.1,000/- per acre, treating the same as phot- kharab land. On reference under s.18, the Court relying upon a sale  deed, Ext.P6 dated February 24, 1975 to an extent of Ac.1.8  cents   sold  at  Rs.50,000/-  per  acre  which  was purchased for  setting up  of a  factory,awarded Rs.42,500/- per acre. Being dissatisfied, the appellant preferred appeal before the  High Court,  who by  its impugned judgment dated September 7,  1979 confirmed  the same,  against which these appeals by special leave have been filed. Two contentions  have  been  raised  by  Mr.M.Veerappa, learned counsel  for the appellant. First, it is argued that in view  of the  fact  that  the  lands  under  Ext-P.6  are situated at  a distance of 2 to 3 furlongs from the acquired lands,  it  would  be  evident  that  those  lands  are  not similarly situated  and, therefore, awarding compensation at he rate  of Rs.42,500/-  per acre  relying on Ext.P.6 is not justified in  law. We  find no  force in the contention. The High Court has considered the fact that the lands are nearer to the  Bangalore-Mysore Road and near about the lands where Coca   Cola    factory   is   established.   Finding   these circumstances favourable  to the respondents, the High Court confirmed the award at the rate of Rs.42,500/- per acre. It was  next contended that the Reference Court and the High Court  were not  justified in  awarding compensation at the rate  of Rs.42,500/-  for Ac.1.34  cents which  is phot- kharab when  the agriculture  lands also had been awarded at the rate of Rs.42,500/- per acre. Though prima facie we were http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 impressed  with   this  argument  but,  unfortunately,  this contention was  not raised  in the  High Court  nor the High Court had  advantage of  going into  this circumstance. Even the Reference  Court judgment  has not been made part of the record. Therefore,  we are  unable  to  know  what  are  the grounds that  weighed with  the  reference  court  to  award compensation at  the rate of Rs.42,500/- for the phot-kharab land to  the extent  of Ac.1.34 cents. It is also to be seen that this  point was  not raised in the grounds of appeal in this Court. In these circumstances, we are constrained not to agree with the  contentions raised  by the  appellant. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.

" J U D G E M E N T Nanavati. J. This appeal  arises out  of  the  judgement  and  order passed by  the High  Court of  Jammu and Kashmir in Criminal Appeal  No.   15  of   1985  and   Criminal  Reference   for Confirmation Case No. 15 of 1985. The  appellant  -  Swaran  Singh  was  tried  alongwith Mohinder Singh for causing death of Kesar Singh and injuries to Man  Singh. The trial court convicted Mohinder Sing under Section 302  and 307  RPC. Swaran  Singh was convicted under Section 302 and 307 both read with Section 109 RPC. The High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence of both the  accused. Both  of them  then filed  Special  leave petition in  the court.  Special leave  petition of Mohinder Singh was  rejected and  only Swaran Singh was granted leave to file an appeal. The only  reason why Swaran Singh has been convicted is that he  had exhorted  Mohinder Singh  to fire  his gun  and finish Kesar Singh and Man Singh and it was pursuant to this exhortation that  Mohinder Singh  had fired shots and killed Kesar Singh  and injured  Man Singh.  What is  urged by  the learned counsel  for the appellant is that no eye-witness in his statement before the Police had stated that Swaran Singh had exhorted  Mohinder Singh  to kill  either Kesar Singh or Man Singh.  The trial  court did not attach any importance t this omission on the ground that it was on a minor point and inspite of  it thought  it fit  to rely upon the evidence of the eye-witness  that Swaran  Singh  had  exhorted  Mohinder Singh to act like that. The High Court also considered it as a  minor  omission  and    agreeing  with  the  trial  court confirmed the finding recorded against him. It is  difficult to appreciate how this omission can be regarded  as   a  minor  omission.  Swaran  Singh  has  been convicted only  on the  basis of the said exhortation. There is no  order evidence  to show that he had taken any part in the killing of Kesar Singh and in injuring Man Singh. It was material improvement made by the eye-witness on an important point and this aspect deserved to be given the due weight by both the  court below.  If really  Swaran Singh had exhorted Mohinder Singh  like that  and then  the witness  would have http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 failed to  say so  in their statements before the police. It is a  consistent improvement made by the eye-witnesses while giving their  evidence. It was obviously made with a view to make Swaran  Singh also  responsible for the murder of Kesar Singh and  injuries caused  to Man  Singh. In  view of  this serious infirmity,  their evidence  regarding involvement of Swaran Singh ought not to have been accepted. We, therefore,  allow this  appeal and  set  aside  the conviction and  sentence of Swaran Singh. His bail bonds are ordered to be cancelled.",This appeal  arises out of  the judgement  and order passed by  the High  Court of  Jammu and Kashmir in Criminal Appeal  No. 15 of 1985.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI.J. The appellant  was tried  for the  offences  punishable under Sections  324 and  307 IPC, Section 27 of the Arms Act and section  6 of  the Terrorist  and Disruptive  Activities (prevention) Act,  1985 in  the Designated Court, Bhiwani at Hissar. The  Allegations against  the appellant were that on 25.6.86 at  about 8.30  p.m. he  assaulted Devi  Lal with  a knife and  gave repeated   stab blows to him, in view of the previous enmity  between him  and the appellant. In order to prove its case the prosecution mainly had heard the cries of Devi Lal himself and his father Hari Singh, who according to the prosecution had heard the cries of Devi Lal and seen the assault on  him. The  Designated Court believed the evidence of both  the witnesses  and convicted  the appellant for the offences punishable  under Section 307 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act read with Section 6(1) of the TADA Act. Aggrieved by  the  order  of  conviction  and  sentence imposed upon him, the appellant has filed this appeal. Learned counsel  for the appellant has taken us through the evidence  of PW 7 Hari Singh and PW 6 Devi Lal. From the cross examination  of PW  6 Devi  Lal, it  appears that  the attempt of  the defence  was to  point out that he was in an intoxicated condition  on the  date of  the incident and was beaten by the villagers as he  was found teasing women. This suggestion was  denied by  the witness and there is no other material on  the basis  of which  it can  be said  that this witness was  under influence  of liquor  and had  misbehaved with anyone.  He had  categorically stated  that when he was returning after taking medicine for this mother and was near Sri Ram  Mandir, he  was attacked  by the appellant. Nothing was brought  in the  cross examination on the basis of which it can  be said  that he  was not  telling the  truth.   The defence was  able to extract only 2 or 3 omissions which are on minor  points and  do not  affect the  veracity  of  this witness. There  is evidence  to show  that  there was enough light at  the place  of incidence.  The accused  was a known person  and,   therefore,  there   was  no   difficulty   in identifying him.  As  soon  as  this  witness  and  regained consciousness and  was in a position to give a statement, he http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 had named  appellant as  the person  who had  given him  the knife blows.  Even if  evidence of  his father Hari Singh in discarded on  the ground  that possibly  he could  not  have seen the actual assault on his son as he had come out of his house after  hearing his  cries, as contended by the learned counsel for  the appellant, that will not have any effect on the conviction  of the appellant as the evidence of Devi Lal is quite  sufficient to  sustain it. As we find no infirmity in the trial court’s judgement even after reappreciating the evidence,  the   appellant’s  conviction   deserves  to   be maintained. This appeal  is, therefore,  dismissed. The bail of the appellant is cancelled. He is directed to surrender to serve out the remaining sentence.","The appellant was tried for the offences punishable under Sections 324 and 307 IPC, Section 27 of the Arms Act and section 6 of the Terrorist  and Disruptive  Activities (prevention) Act, 1985.

Section  49  of  the  Act  empowers  the  State Government to place any industrial area or industrial estate under the  management and  control of  the  Corporation.  In furtherance thereof,  certain plots  have been  offered  for allotment in  the industrial areas. The respondent is one of the offerers  to accept  the plot. By letter dated August 1, 1987, the  appellant had offered the shed For 90 years lease for the  consideration mentioned thereunder. The respondent, by letter  dated September  3, 1987,  accepted the offer and requested to transfer the plot in his favour. In furtherance thereof, the plot came to be allotted. Subsequently, relying upon the  internal correspondence between the Government and the respondent  and  the  letter  of  the  Government  dated 14.10.1980, the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court seeking direction to reduce the amount fixed under the lease. The  High Court  in the  impugned order  directed  to place the matter before the Government for final decision in the light of the directions. The question,  therefore,is: whether  the view  of  the High Court is correct in law? Section 4 of the Act vests the general  superintendence,   directions  and   management  of affairs and  business of  the Corporation  in the  Board  of Directors subject  to the  powers issued  by the  Government under Section 18 which reads as under: ""18. The State Government may issue http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to the  Corporation such general or special directions  as to policy as it may think necessary or expedient for carrying  out the  purposes  of this  Acts,   and  the  Corporation shall be  bound to  follow and  act upon such directions,"" Section 33  which is  sought to  be relied  on  by  the counsel for  the respondent  also contemplates  that certain directions  be   given  by   the  State  Government  to  the Corporation in  the way for disposal of the land acquired by the Government  and transfer  to it  without undertaking  or carrying out  any development thereon. Such directions would not be  construed a  routine administrative direction in the day to  day administration  of the  Corporation, It  must be read along with Section 18 in which the Government have been given power  to give  special of  general  directions  as  a policy guideline  in the  management of  the Board  and also disposal of  the properties.  Otherwise, the  very authority gets eroded  and it  would become  a wing  of the Government Department which  does not  appear to  be the  object of the Act. The  letter which was relied on by the respondent would indicate as  if the  State has assumed the management in the day to  day control  of the administration of the affairs of the Board  and the  manner in  which the  sites  are  to  be disposed  of.  It  would  appear  that  the  Government  had exceeded its  power under Section 18 read with Section 33 of the Act. Accordingly, the  High Court  was not  right in  giving direction to  place the  matter again before the Government. Six months’  time is  given to  the respondent  to  pay  the balance amount. The appeal is allowed. No costs.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the Division  Bench of the High  Court of Orissa, Cuttack Bench made in OJC  No.779/89.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. This appeal by special 1eave  arises from  the order of the single Judge of the Madhya  Pradesh  High  Court  at  Jabalpur  Bench  dated January 20, 1993 made in M.A. No.337/91. The  appellant  laid  the  suit  for  declaration  of prescriptive title  to the  property from  1974 in  his  own right and perfected the title thereto by adverse possession. He also filed an application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC seeking temporary injunction restraining the respondent from interdicting his  possession pending  the  suit.  The  trial Court granted  the injunction  but on appeal it was reversed by  the learned single Judge in the impugned order. The High Court has concluded that when there is no dispute as regards the incoporeal  right in litigation, the declaratory suit is only a  right to  the property  but not to the right itself; Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC could be availed of only when the property, the  subject matter thereof, is in danger of being wasted, damaged  or otherwise  being dealt with. In a simple suit for declaratory nature without any consequential relief there cannot  be any dispute as regards the property because the dispute is not about the property but to the entitlement of the  right sought in respect of the property which itself is directly involved in the suit but not in an Interlocutory order. Consequently,  it was  held that the grant of interim injunction is  beyond the  jurisdiction of  the Court  under Order 39  rule 1  and 2.  We are  of the  view that the view expressed by the High Court is not correct in law. In a suit for declaration  of title  simpliciter, the  Court has power under Order  39, Rules  1 and  2 or  even in  Section 151 to grant ad interim injunction pending suit. Admittedly, the  appellant  is  in  possession  of  the property. In view of his apprehension that there is a threat to his  possession, his only remedy wou1d be whether he will http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 be entitled  to the declaration sought for. When he seeks to protect  his   possession,  if   he  is  otherwise  entitled according to  law, necessarily  the Court  has  to  consider whether protection  is to  be given to him pending the suit. Merely because  there is no dispute as regards the corporeal right to  the property,  it does not necessarily follow that he is not entitled to avail the remedy under Order 39, Rules 1 and  2 CPC.  Even otherwise  also, it  is settled law that under Section  151 CPC,  the Court has got inherent power to protect the  rights of  the parties  pending the suit. Under these circumstances,  the view  expressed by  the High Court that application  itself  is  not  maintainable  is  clearly illegal and erroneous. The application under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 is maintainable. The matter  is remitted  to the  High Court to consider the case on merits and dispose it of according to law, since the High Court did not consider the case on merits. Status  quo would  continue till  the disposal of the appeal in the High Court. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","This appeal by special 1eave  arises from the order of the single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High  Court at Jabalpur dated January 20, 1993 made in M.A. No.337/91.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the judgment and order  of the  Orissa High  Court, made on September 18, 1996 in OJC No.2148/95. The petitioner was appointed as a clerk on June 1, 1974 against a vacancy. On August 9, 1990, she seems to have been kept in-charge  of teaching  post in  the school.  It is her claim that  pursuant thereto  she was teaching as a teacher. Since no  action was  taken by  the authorities  to have her appointed as a teacher, she filed OJC No.671/91 on March 27, 1992 and  pending disposal  interim direction  was  granted. Pursuant  thereto,   she  was   appointed  with  provisional approval by  the Director  on August  4,  1992.  On  a  writ petition filed  by the  5th respondent  on  April  15,  1993 alleging that  she was  not entitled to the post, the matter was directed to be reconsidered. The Director refused appeal by proceeding dated March 4, 1995 resulting in filing of the present writ  petition. It  is contended that the High Court was not  right in  rejecting the claim of the petitioner, on the  ground   that  all   those  cases  which  were  pending consideration, required  to be  decided in  accordance  with Full Bench  judgment of  the High  Court in  OJC No.5361/91, decided on  December 2,  1994. Since  the petitioner’s claim was  already  considered  and  approval  was  given  by  the Director, it  is not a pending case and she must, therefore, be  appointed  as  a  teacher.  We  find  no  force  in  the contention. It is  seen that  appointment should  be in  accordance with the  Rules to  a post  as defined under Section 2(b) of the Orissa  Education (Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Teachers  and Members  of the  Staff of  Aided  Education Institutions) Rules,  1974. Since the petitioner was working in a  clerical post,  she is not entitled to be approved and the view  taken by  the Director is correct. Admittedly, she was appointed  as a  clerk. While working as clerk, the mere fact that  she was kept in charge of the teaching post, does not confer  any right  to appointment to a post, because she was not  initially appointed  to a  teaching post.  The Full Bench, therefore,  has rightly  interpreted that the initial appointment should be to a teaching post and a clerk, though http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 directed to  discharge the duties as a teacher, cannot claim the post  as a  teacher. Consequently,  the earlier Division Bench judgment  of the  High Court  was set aside. Resultant operation was  that all  those cases  which had become final were directed not to be reopened and all those cases pending consideration  either   in  writ   petition  or  before  the authorities were  required to  be dealt  with in  accordance with the  Rules. Though  the  petitioner  was  provisionally given approval  pursuant to the direction issued by the High Court in  the said writ petition, that would be only subject to the  appointment and  since no  appointment could be made and was  in fact not made, the order could not be said to be in accordance  with  the  Rules.  The  provisional  approval granted  by  the  Director  cannot  be  construed  to  be  a ratification of the petitioner’s appointment as teacher. The view of  this Court  in Krishna Chandra v. State of Orissa & Ors.  [CA  No.13755/96]  decided  on  November  1,  1996  is consistent with  the above  view and  is of  no help  to the petitioner. Under  these circumstance,  we do  not find  any illegality in  the order passed by the High Court warranting interference. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","The petitioner was appointed as a clerk on June 1, 1974 against a vacancy.

" JUDGMENT 2001 Supp(1) SCR 466 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Special leave granted. In the instant case, a suit was filed by the appellant for recovery of money from the principal debtor as well as the guarantors. The suit was transferred to the Debts Recovery Tribunal and thereafter on 17th May, 1996 decree was passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Calcutta. The said suit was decieed for a sum of Rs. 12,09,175.39 against the principal debtor as well as against the guarantors, along with interest thereon, and it was further directed that the Recovery Officer shall first proceed to realise the amount on the sale of hypothecated plant and machinery and mortgaged property belonging to respondents 5 and 4 respectively and thereafter proceed to realise the balance, if any, in accordance with law. Pursuant thereto, certificate was issued and recovery proceedings started. The respondent who was a guarantor and whose property was stated to have been mortgaged filed a petition under Article 227 before the High Court at Calcutta. The High Court allowed the petition by observing that as the mortgaged property was situated in Chennai the Debts Recovery Tribunal had no territorial jurisdiction in respect thereto and it could not have directed sale of mortgaged property It, accordingly, held that the Bank would be at liberty to proceed against defendant No. 4, respondent herein, in appropriate forum for recovery of debts by sale of mortgaged property. Hence this appeal. In our opinion, the order which was passed by the Tribunal directing sale of mortgaged property was appealable under Section 20 of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (for short ""the Act""). The High Court ought not to have exercised its jurisdiction under Article 227 in view of the provision for alternative remedy contained in the Act. We Jo not propose to go into the correctness of the decision of the High Court an I whether the order passed by the Tribunal was correct or not has to be decided before an appropriate forum. The Act has been enacted with a view to provide a special procedure for recovery of debts due to the banks and the financial institutions. There is hierarchy of appeal provided in the Act, namely, filing of an appeal under Section 20 and this last track procedure cannot be allowed to be derailed either b> taking recourse to proceedings under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution or by filing a civil suit, which is expressly barred. Even though a provision court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, nevertheless when there is an alternative remedy available judicial prudence demands that the court refrains from exercising its jurisdiction http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 under the said constitutional provisions. This was a case where the High Court should not have entertained the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution and should have directed the respondent to take recourse to the appeal mechanism provided by the Act. For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is allowed and the impugned order of the Calcutta High Court in CO. No. 1305/1997 is set aside.","A suit was filed by the appellant for recovery of money from the principal debtor as well as the guarantors.

" O R D E R A limited  argument is  addressed in  this appeal  that impugns the  judgment and  order of  a Division Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan. The appellants  manufacture tyre  yarn cord  and fabric for which  purpose they import tyre cord grade woodpulp from the United State of America. The appellants were called upon to pay  additional duty  thereon  under  the  provisions  of Sections 3 of the Customs Tariff Act. Among other  contentions raised  by the  appellants was this: The  said woodpulp was not produced or manufactured in India. Under  the terms  of Section  3 additional  duty had, therefore, to  be calculated on the basis of the excise duty that would  be leviable  on  the  class  or  description  of articles to  which the  said woodpulp belonged. There was no entry in  the Tariff  that related to an article of the like of the  said woodpulp.  Entry 68,  being a  residuary  entry relating to no class or description of goods, did not apply. No additional  duty was,  therefore, leviable  on  the  said woodpulp. The said  contention  was  rejected  by  the  Assistant Collector and  by the  High Court in the writ petition filed the appellants. It is the only contention raised before us. Section 3  of the  Customs Tariff  Act, so far as it is relevant, reads thus:- ""S.3.-  Levy   of  Additional  Duty equal to Excise Duty: (1) Any  article which  is imported into India  shall, in  addition, be liable to  a duty  (hereinafter  in the  section  referred  to  as  the additional  duty)   equal  to   the excise  duty  for  the  time  being leviable  on   a  like  article  if produced or  manufactured in  India and if  such excise  duty on a like http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 article   is    leviable   at   any percentage  of   its   value,   the additional  duty   to   which   the imported article shall be so liable of  the   value  of   the  imported article. Explanation:- In  this section, the expression the  excise duty for the article if being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India  means the excise duty for the time being in force which would be leviable  on a  like article  if produced or  manufactured in India, or if  a like  article  is  not  so produced  or   manufactured,  which would be  leviable on  the class or description of  articles  to  which the imported  article belongs,  and where  such  duty  is  leviable  at different rates, the highest duty,"" It  is   the  Explanation   which  is   important.  The expression ""the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article  if produced  or manufactured  in India used in the body  of sub-section (1) is explained to mean the excise duty for the time being in force (a) which would be leviable on a  like article if produced or manufactured in India, the excise  duty   that  would  be  leviable  on  the  class  or description  of  articles  to  which  the  imported  article belongs. Where a like article is not produced or manufactured in India additional  article upon  the basis of the excise duty that is  leviable on the class or description of articles to which the  imported article  belongs. Articles which are not elsewhere described,  falling under  the residuary Entry 68, form a  class by themselves. Hence, if a like article is not described in  the Tariff, additional duty is leviable on the imported article  upon the  basis of the levy of excise duty under the provisions of Entry 68.

" JUDGMENT S.B. SINHA, J. : 1. The State of Punjab is before us aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated 10.7.2000 in LPA No. 800/2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dismissing the LPA arising from the judgment and order of a learned Single Judge of the said Court in writ petitions filed by the respondents herein, opining that their cases should be considered for promotion to the post of Principal, Grade II. 2. The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute. Respondents were appointed as Masters in the Education Department of the State of Punjab. As they possessed Master degree, they were promoted to the post of Lecturer. In or about 1974, they were temporarily posted as headmasters. A sample copy of the order of such posting is in the following terms : ""The following Masters/Lecturers are hereby provisionally posted at their own pay and grade on the post of Headmasters. (P.E.S. III) Non Gazetted Men Branch. These postings are purely temporary and all are subject to the conditions noted below : xxx                        xxx                          xxx 3. They continued to work on the post of Headmaster till about 1978. However, rules were framed in terms whereof the posts of Principal, Grade II were to be filled up by way of promotion as also by direct recruit in the ratio of 75 : 25. 4. It is stated that the State had issued a circular on or about 24th January, 1977 laying down the ratio of 60 : 40 for filling up the posts of Headmaster/Lecturer. The respondents were denied the promotion to the post of Principal, Grade II by an order dated 15.7.1995, inter alia on the premise that they, having been promoted to the post of Headmaster, lost their lien on the post of Lecturer. 5. Writ petitions filed by the respondents have been allowed as noticed hereinbefore. Letter Patent Appeals filed by the State of Punjab thereagainst were dismissed. 6. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that in view of the rules aforementioned the High Court could not have passed the impugned judgment. 7. It is not in dispute that similar question came up for consideration before Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No. 2441/1982 and Civil Writ Petition No. 4918/1996, wherein a similar contention raised by the State had been rejected. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 8. The learned Single Judge of the High Court had followed the aforementioned decision. We do not find any reason to differ therewith. Respondents were promoted on provisional basis. It cannot, therefore, be said that they lost their lien. Even the Cadre Controlling Authority could not have changed their cadre without their consent. Even otherwise having regard to the fact that they were provisionally promoted to the post of Principal long before the rules came into force, in absence of any express provision contained therein or any option sought for from the respondents, they could not have been denied the benefit of promotion to the post of Principal, Grade II. If such a contention is upheld, in our opinion, the same would result in an absurdity. All rules as is well known must be considered in a reasonable and pragmatic manner. The respondents having been promoted to the post of Headmaster, which was permissible at the relevant time, cannot be denied the benefit of promotion to the post of Principal, Grade II, although they held the post of Lecturer. Even otherwise, in our opinion, denial of said benefit to the respondents would be unjust in law. For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in these appeals which are dismissed accordingly.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2      The  appellant was appointed in July 29,  1972  as  a Librarian in government College in the Pay-scale of  Rs.220- 550. The Haryana government accepting the recommendations of government  of  India and the University  grants  Commission upgraded  the pay-scales of Librarian with effect  from  1st January,  1973   to Rs.7001600, if they possessed a  minimum educational qualification of first or second Class M.A.,  M. Sc., M.Com plus a first or second Class B.Lib. Science or  a diploma  in  Library Science, the degree of  MLib.  being  a preferential    qualification.   Thereafter   taking    into consideration,  representation  made  by  several  Librarian appointed  prior  to  3  l st  December,  1972  and  of  the recommendations  of  the University grants  Commission,  the government of India in their proceedings of January 16, 1987 relaxed the requirement of securing first of second class in MA.,   M.Sc.,   MCom.  and  other   prescribed   educational qualifications,  by  an  order which was  in  the  following terms: ""it    has   now   been   decided,   on    the recommendation  of the UGC, that the  existing incumbents  of  the  post  of  Librarians   in College who have been appointed to these posts on  or before 3.12.1972 may be sanctioned  the upgraded  scale of Rs. 700-1600 in  relaxation of the qualification prescribed in  Annexure-l referred to above without insisting on a first or  second  class in the  degree,  diploma  or other prescribed educational qualification."" 3.     The Principal of the College, where the appellant was working as a Librarian allowed to him the revised  pay-scale of  Rs.700-1600  purporting to act under  the  above  order. However,  the  govt. of Haryana directed  the  Principal  to withdrew the pay-scale of Rs.700-1600 allowed to  appellant. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The  appellant had challenged their direction in C.W.P.  No. 10988 of 1993  in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.  The High  Court  by the impugned order dated September  9,  1993 dismissed  the  writ petition. Thus this appeal  by  special leave. 4.    Mr. Prom Malhotra, .learned counsel for the appellant, contended  that the previous scale of Rs. 220-559  in  which the  appellant  was  entitled became  Rs.7001600  since  the appellant  had been granted that scale of pay in  relaxation of  the  educational  qualification. The   High  Court  was, therefore, not right in dismissing the writ petition. We  do not  find any force in this contention. It is seen that  the government  in  consultation  with  the  University   grants Commission  had revised the payscale of a Librarian  working in  the Colleges to Rs. 700-1600 but they insisted upon  the minimum  educational qualification of first or second  class M.A.,., M. Com. plus a first or second class B.Lib.  Science or  a diploma in Library Science. The relaxation  given  was only as regards obtaining first class or second class in the prescribed  educational qualification but not relaxation  in the educational qualification itself. 5.     Admittedly the appellant does not 26 possess  the required educational qualifications. Under  the circumstance  the  appellant would not be  entitled  to  the relaxation.   The  Principal  erred  in   granting  him  the relaxation.  Since the date of relaxation the appellant  had been paid his salary on revised scale. However, it is not on account of any mis-representation made by the appellant that the  benefit  of higher pay-scale was given to  him  but  by wrong  construction  made  by the Principal  for  which  the appellant  cannot  be  held  to  be  at  fault.   Under  the circumstances the amount paid till date may not be recovered from  the  appellant. The Principle of equal pay  for  equal work  would  not  apply  to  the  scale  prescribed  by  the University  Grants Commission. The appeal is allowed  partly without any order as to costs. 27","The appellant was appointed in July 29, 1972 as a Librarian in government College in the Pay-scale of  Rs.220- 550.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The appellant had entrusted to the respondent 147 bales of  raw   wools  worth   Rs.51.48  lakhs   as  carriers  for transportation to  Cawnpore Woolen Mills. In spite of taking delivery thereof,  the respondent  had detained the goods in his custody, laid the suit O.S. No.612/94 in the Civil Court at  Kanpur   for  a  permanent  injunction  restraining  the appellant from taking forcibile possession of the goods with the allegation  that a  sum of  Rs.13,48,817.13 was due from the appellant towards arrears of transportation charges. The interim injunction  sought for  was  initially  granted  but later on  vacated. Ultimately,  in appeal,  the  High  Court directed the appellant to give bank guarantee to the tune of the amount  purported to  be due as pleaded for in the suit. We are informed that the bank guarantee has accordingly been given. The  appellant entrusted  taking of  delivery of  the possession of  the goods to the carriers-respondent who laid the suit  on July  1, 1994  and interim mandatory injunction was sought for and was granted. These proceedings  arise out  of  an  application  made under Section  10 CPC  on September 19, 1994 seeking stay of the trial  in O.S.  No.793/94. The trial court dismissed it, but the  High Court  in revision  has directed  stay of  the suit. Thus, this appeal by special leave.

By this Petition,  under Article  32  of the Constitution of India,  the  Petitioners seek to challenge levy of stamp duty on a transfer of shares in  a  Co-operative Housing Society on the basis  that  such agreements   are  conveyances.   It  is  contended  by   the Petitioners  that the State Legislature has no competence to levy  stamp  duty  on  transfer  of  shares  in  a   Housing Co-operative  Society, where the transferee, as an  incident of  membership, is entitled to the use and occupation of the premises  belonging  to  the   co-operative  society.    The Petitioners  point out that this question is already pending in  Civil Appeal No.  3707 of 1990 before this Court.

" J U D G M E N T RUMA PAL, J. During the years 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98, the respondent Textile Mills cleared grey cotton canvas clothes and grey cotton fabrics, without payment of any central excise duty on the ground that the products were classifiable under Chapter   52 of the Central Excise and Tariff Act 1985 under which the rate of excise duty was nil at the relevant point of time.  According to the Revenue Authorities the goods were classifiable under sub-heading 5911.90 of the Tariff and liable for central excise duty at the rates specified on the Tariff.  A show cause notice was issued on 27th December, 2000 why central excise duty should not be recovered and why penal action should not be taken against the respondent. In the meanwhile the respondent- Textile Mills were closed down in September, 1997 and M/s. Moti Lal Traders started functioning from the same premises with the same machinery. The Additional Commissioner of Central Excise relying on the case of M/s. Simplex Mills Co. Ltd. Vs CCE Nagpur: 1993 (49) ECR 147 confirmed the demand of duty and also imposed personal penalty on the respondent and ordered interest on the delayed payment. Duty was also demanded from M/s. Moti Lal Traders and personal penalty as well as interest was levied. The respondent and  M/s. Moti Lal Traders both preferred appeals before the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals). The appeals were allowed by following the decision of  a larger Bench of the Tribunal in Jyoti Overseas Limited Vs. CCE, Indore, reported in 2001 (130) ELT 446 which overruled the decision in Simplex (supra)  and held that cotton fabrics which were not ’made up’ were correctly classifiable under Chapter 52 and not TH 59.09 (subsequently numbered as 5911.09).       The Tribunal dismissed the appellant’s appeal on the same ground. The decision in Jyoti Overseas Limited (supra) has been approved by this Court in our judgment dated 1st March, 2005 in C.A. Nos. 2816-2818/2002, Commissioner of Central Excise, Nagpur Vs. M/s. Simplex Mills Co. Ltd.

We are  not inclined to grant special leave, but we  make this  short speaking order in order to keep the record straight  that the  dismissal of  the  special  leave petition does  not tentamount  to affirmance of the order of the learned  Judge of the High Court who for reasons utterly untenable interfered with teh 215 sentence imposed  by the  trial  court  and  reduced  it  to sentence  already   undergone  which   in  the   facts   and circumstances of the case was wholly impermissible. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In Meet Singh v.

This Court examined what constitute special  reasons for the purpose of Sec. 5(2) and pointed out  that the reasons which weighed with the learned Judge in  reducing the  sentence to  the sentence  undergone could not  be special  reasons.

" O R D E R The special  leave petition arises from the order dated 7th August, 1995 passed by the Bombay High Court in W.P. NO. 1334 of  1995. The  Customs officials at Sahar International Airport, Bombay  apprehended one  Sukhawani Solanki  when he was attempting  to export  foreign  exchange  out  of  India valuing  Rs.  13,27,212/-.  Mr.  Solanki  in  his  statement recorded under Section 108 of the Customs Act by the Customs official, had  stated that  one Mr. Subhash Dudani had given him the  currency to hand over to Mr. Kenny at Hongkong. The Customs officials  apprehended Mr. Subhash Dudani who in his statement recorded  under Section  108 stated  that  foreign exchange given  to Solanki  was received from one Mr. Rajesh Sukhawani. Thereafter,  the  Customs  officials  traced  the petitioner and  had searched  his premises  on December  21, 1991,  in   his  absence,   but  nothing  incriminating  was recovered. The  Customs   officials  initiated   proceedings   for confiscation of  foreign exchange  and used the statement of Mr. Dudani against the petitioner, After enquiry and gaiving an opportunity  to the  petitioner, the Additional Collector confiscated the foreign currency and impoed a penalty of Rs. 1 lakh.  When the  petitioner challenged the confiscation in appeal, the  Collector set aside the said order. On suo motu revision, the Government reversed the order of the Collector and restored the order of the Additional Collector which was affirmed by  the High  Court by the impugned order. Thus the special leave petition. The Joint  Secretary to  the Government, the revisional authority, has  held that  the evidence  and  the  statement given by  Mr. Dudani  incriminates the  petitioner. This was established with  reference to  the  photographs  and  other intrinsic material.  On that  basis, he  concluded that  Mr. Dudani incriminated himself and the appellant in passing off foreign currency  out of  India, i.e.,  to Hong Kong. It was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 accordingly held  that the contravention was established. It is contended  that the  statement of coaccused could be used only  to   corroborate  other   evidence  as   one  of   the circumstances under  Section 30  of the Evidence Act. But it cannot be used as substantive evidence without corroboration from other  independent evidence.  Except the  statement  of Dudani, there is no other independent evidence. Mr. Dudani’s evidence cannot  be pressed  into service  to arrive  at the conclusion that  the petitioner  is involved  in the passing off foreign currency out of India. It must  be remembered  that the  statement made before the Customs  officials is  not a  statement  recorded  under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. Therefore, it is  a material  piece of  evidence collected  by  Customs officials  under  Section  108  of  the  Customs  Act.  That material incriminates  the petitioner inculpating him in the contravention of  the provisions  of the  Customs  Act.  The material can  certainly be used to connect the petitioner in the contravention inasmuch as Mr. Dudani’s statement clearly inculpates not only himself but also the petitioner. It can, therefore, be  used as  substantive evidence  connecting the petitioner  with  the  contravention  by  exporting  foreign currency out of India. Therefore, we do not think that there is any  illegality in  the order  of confisaction of foreign currency and  imposition of  penalty.  There  is  no  ground warrantaing reduction of fine. The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.","Customs officials at Sahar International Airport, Bombay apprehended one Sukhawani Solanki when he was attempting to export  foreign  exchange out of India valuing  Rs. 13,27,212.

It would appear that there was some problem which was not  brought to the notice of the Court at the time when the matter  was disposed  of. I.As.  were filed,  one by the Union of  India and one by DDA. As per the application filed by the  Union of  India, they  proposed four alternative for allotment of  the plots  to them.  After going  through  the record, we  have put  them to  the learned  counsel for  the parties. Shri Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing for some of them, has also discussed with the parties. After the  discussion,  it  now  emerges  that  alternative  No.IV proposed  by  the  Union  of  India  is  acceptable  and  is accordingly accepted by them. As per that, residential flats are required to be constructed for the said 19 petitioner in an extent of one acre of the land. The area required for the said flat to be constructed by them will be ""A.B.C.D. - 1.00 acre"" and  P &  SP to  be with  DDA, the area is of 2 acres. Hence, there is no need to cut the existing trees growth. It is suggested  that the  petitioner themselves would make the construction under the direction and supervision of the DDA.

" ORDER 1. A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition  Act, 1894,  (for  short, ’the Act’) was published  in  the  State gazette on September 6, 1974 acquiring 22 acres 63  decimals of  the land situated in Village Rasoolpur of Devdas  Distt. of  M.P.  for  industrial  purpose.   The  Land  Acquisition Officer  in his award dated June 1975 determined the  market value at Rs. 1,500/per acre and given the compensation  with statutory  benefits.  On reference, the Civil Court  by  its award  and  decree  dated  October  22,  1980  enhanced  the compensation to Rs.4,900/- per acre which worked out to  Rs. 1,08,000/- in all.  At this stage it is relevant to  mention that  the respondent herself purchased the  entire  acquired land  under  registered sale deed dated September  4,  1974, just  two  days  earlier  to  the  date  of  publication  of preliminary  notification for a total sum of  Rs.1,08,000/-. The  respondent not being satisfied, carried the  matter  in appeal  to the High Court under s.54 of the Act.   The  High Court, by its impugned judgment in Transfer Appeal No.323/82 dated  November  1, 1983, enhanced the compensation  to  Rs. 10,000/per  acre.  In other words, the High Court awarded  a total compensation of Rs.2,27,000/- with statutory  benefits thereon.   Feeling aggrieved against  enhanced  compensation awarded by the High Court, this appeal by special leave  has been filed. 2. The High Court in our considered view, committed palpable and  manifest error of law in ignoring the sale deed of  the respondent  herself dated September 4, 1974 wherein she  had paid total consideration of a sum of Rs. 1,08,000/- for  the acquired  land.  It is contended by learned  senior  counsel for  the respondent that this is an industrial area and  the very  purpose for which acquisition is sought to be made  is for  industrial purpose.  The respondent  herself  purchased the  property  for industrial purpose.  The High  Court  had rightly   taken   into  consideration   those   -facts   and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 circumstances  and  enhanced the compensation.  We  find  no force  in  the contention- When the respondent  herself  had purchased  the property for the purpose of  establishing  an industry  and got the sale deed registered on  September  4, 1974, it would furnish ipso facto the sole basis for  deter- mination  of  market value of the self same land.   For  the property  purchased  by  paying a consideration  of  of  Rs. 1,08,000/-, no reasonable and prudent buyer, within two days thereafter,  would  purchase  the land by paying  a  sum  of Rs.2,27,000/- as determined by the High Court.  It is  quite unreasonable  and credulous to believe that a prudent  buyer in normal market conditions would agree to pay Rs.1,19,000/- more  within  two  days for the self same  land.   The  High Court,    therefore,   totally   ignored   these    relevant considerations while enhancing the compensation without  ap- Plication of mind on the basis of sale transactions of small bits of other lands.  In V. Salgoacar & Pvt.  Ltd. v.  Union of India (C.A. No.3800/89) dated January 11, 1995 on similar facts,  this  Court affirmed the judgment of High  Court  of Bombay  reversing  the  award of  the  reference  court  and awarded  at the rate purchased by the claimants  itself  The judgment  and  decree of the High Court is,  therefore,  set aside 539 and  that  of  the  Dist.

The High Court, after referring to four decisions of this Court in Amar Nath and others vs. State of Haryana and another 1977 SCC(Cri) 585, Madhu Limaye vs. State of Maharashtra 1978 SCC (Cri) 10,  Rajendra Kumar Sitaram Pande and others vs. Uttam and another 1999 SCC(Cri) 393 and  V.C. Shukla vs. State 1980 SCC (Cri) 695 held that an order summoning an accused is not an interlocutory order and, therefore, the bar created by Section 397(2) Cr.P.C.  would not operate.  The High Court accordingly set aside the order dated 27.8.2004 passed by the learned Sessions Judge and remanded the matter for deciding the revision on merits. The petitioner who had decided the Criminal Revision Petition on 27.8.2004 in his capacity as Sessions Judge is aggrieved by certain remarks made against him in the order of the High Court.  The main plea taken in the present Special Leave Petition is that the order dated 31.7.2004, wherein the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate had only recorded that the accused are absent and the case be posted for appearance of the accused on 27.8.2004, was an interlocutory order and,  therefore, the bar created by Section 397(2) Cr.P.C. would operate.  An English translation of the memorandum of revision which was filed before the learned Sessions Judge has been filed as Annexure P-3 and it shows that the accused had specifically written that they were aggrieved by the order dated 31.7.2004 and also by the order taking cognizance of the offence and summoning them.  The grounds of revision also indicate that the accused had laid challenge to the order taking cognizance of the offence and summoning them to face trial.  However, we http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 do not want to express any concluded opinion on this question. Having regard to the entire facts and circumstances of the case, we consider it appropriate to dispose of the Special Leave Petition with the direction to the petitioner to move an application before the High Court for expunging the remarks by which he feels aggrieved.  If such an application is filed, the High Court will decide the same in accordance with law, without being influenced in any manner by any observation made in the present order.","A Criminal Revision Petition was filed by the accused before the Sessions Judge, Ghazipur which was dismissed on the ground that the order under challenge was an interlocutory order.

M.B.A. No. 1395/86 Gopal  Subramaniam, A.M. Garg and R.  Venkataramani  for the Petitioner. Dalveer Bhandari for the Respondents. 980 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by THAKKAR, J. The widespread belief that dowry deaths  are even now treated with some casualness at all levels seems to be  well grounded. The High Court has  granted  anticipatory http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 bail  in such a matter. We are of the opinion that the  High Court should not have exercised its jurisdiction to  release the accused on anticipatory bail in disregard of the  magni- tude and seriousness of the matter. The matter regarding the unnatural  death of the daughter-in-law at the house of  her father-in-law  was still under investigation and the  appro- priate course to adopt was to allow the concerned Magistrate to  deal with the same on the basis of the  material  before the Court at the point of time of their arrest in case  they were  arrested.  It was neither prudent nor proper  for  the High Court to have granted anticipatory bail which order was very  likely  to occasion prejudice by its very  nature  and timing. We therefore consider it essential to sound a  seri- ous  note of caution for future. The High Court is under  no compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant anticipato- ry  bail in a matter of this nature. So far as  the  present matter is concerned, since it has become infructuous, we  do not  propose  to pass any order. Subject to  these  observa- tions, the appeal is dismissed. P.S.S.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION : Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 1839 of 1979. Appeal by  Special Leave  from the  Judgment and  Order dated 19-1-1973  of the  Punjab and  Haryana High  Court  in Criminal Appeal No. 329/75. J. P. Goyal and S. K. Jain for the Petitioner. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J. Parvati, an unsophisticated girl of 17 was wending  her way  home at  about sunset  along a  public street in  the artless  town of  Sitalpur in Bihar when Smt. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Devki, the  petitioner  before  us,  with  diabolic  design, swooped down  and snatched  her into  a taxi-cab  and blized away. The weeping victim was medicated into unconsciousness, removed to  Dhanbad and  further on, to destination Haryana. Tragically, where  tourists abound,  satellite industries in female  flesh  flourish,  unless  the  State  crusades  with militant zeal  to stamp  out  this  terrible  vice.  Anyway, Parvati, by now enslaved in a village villa. was offered for marital sale to affluent lecherous youths. The damsel 92 in distress desperately escaped through a half-ajar door and eventually  landed   in  a   police  station.   The   police investigation unravelled  the pathetic story and ended up in a case,  conviction, appeal,  confirmation and,  finally, in this special  leave petition to this Court which is the last refuge of every vanquished litigant. Confronted by concurrent findings of guilt, counsel for the petitioner  gave up  his attack  on the  conviction  and concentrated his  fire on the sentence, which, in this case, was three  years’ rigorous  imprisonment.  For  what  ?  For abducting  a  teenage  girl  and  forcing  her  into  sexual submission with commercial object, a racket which has become an   enormous    national   menace,    notwithstanding   the constitutional concern  for the weaker sex. Counsel dared to urge that  the Probation of Offenders Act should be extended to  this   abominable  culprit   who  had  shown  sufficient expertise in  the art  of abduction,  seduction and  sale of girls to  others who offer a tempting price. The features of this case  show that  the petitioner suddenly descended in a taxi-cab and  kidnapped the  young woman, and when she cried out, administered the potion which rendered her unconscious. Furthermore, a  well layout  plan is discernible when we see the geographical  spread of  the crime. From a small town in Bihar, the girl is despatched to Dhanbad and from there, via Delhi, to  Haryana, lodged  in a  house where young men were asked to  view her  for obvious  immoral purposes.  It is an insulting stultification  of  the  amelioratory  legislation viz. Probation  of Offenders  Act to  extend its considerate provisions to  such anti-social,  specialist criminals.  All that we  can do  is to  reject the plea with indignation and follow it  up with  an appeal  to the  State Governments  of Bihar and of Haryana to put a special squad on the trail and hound out  every such  offender so  that the  streets of our towns and  cities may be sanitized and safe after sunset for Indian womanhood.

To include  or not  to include a particular language in the VIIIth  Schedule  is  a  policy  matter  of  the  Union. Generally speaking,  the Courts do not, in exercise of their power of judicial review, interfere in policy matters of the State, unless  the policy  so formulated either violates the mandate of the Constitution or any statutory provision or is otherwise actuated  by mala  fides.   No such  infirmity  is present in the instant case.

Insofar as the challenge to the constitutional validity of the 71st Amendment Act of 1992 by which Manipuri, Konkani and  Nepali   were  included   in  the  VIIIth  Schedule  is concerned, we  fail  to  see  how  the  inclusion  of  those languages violates any ""basic structure of the Constitution"" as alleged  by the  petitioners.

" RAJENDRA BABU, J.  : This  appeal  is  by special leave  against  an  order passed  by  the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in a  batch  of cases.   By that order, the High Court considered the effect of  a  combined reading of Sections 2(1A) and 2(14)  of  the Income  Tax Act, 1961 [hereinafter referred to as the Act] and  has  held that (i) capital gains arising from  sale  of land used for agricultural purposes would be revenue derived from  such land and, therefore, agricultural income within the  definition  under  Section 2(1A) of the  Act  with  the result  that Parliament would have no legislative competence to  tax such agricultural income;  and (ii) amended  Section 2(14)(iii)   should   be   read   down   to   preserve   its constitutionality.   All land used for agricultural purposes whether situated in areas mentioned in Section 2(14)(iii)(a) and (b) should be held to be excluded from the definition of capital  asset.   Thus  Section 2(14)(iii)  should  read  as excluding from capital asset agricultural land in India, not being  land  situated in the areas mentioned therein.   Upon such interpretation, Section 2(14)(iii) does not enable levy of  tax on capital gains arising from transfer of land which is  used  for  agricultural  purposes  wherever  it  may  be situated. In  this  appeal, challenge to this order is based  on many  grounds  and our attention has been drawn  to  several decisions  not only taking similar but also a contrary view. The  respondents having remained ex-parte, we requested Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Advocate, to assist the Court as amicus curiae.   We  are  beholden   for  the  valuable  assistance rendered by him to the Court. By  Finance Act, 1989, Explanation to Section 2(1A) is inserted  with  effect from 1.4.1970 to supersede  the  view expressed  in  the order under appeal and several  decisions setting  out  similar  ratio.   This  declaratory  amendment having  retrospective  operation  though coming  into  force during  the pendency of this appeal must be given effect to. The  said  Explanation  clearly declares  that  the  revenue derived  from  land  shall not include and shall  be  deemed never  to have included any income arising from the transfer of  any  land referred to in Section 2(14)(iii)(a)  or  (b). The  upshot of the same is that income derived from sale  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 such  agricultural lands cannot be treated as  agricultural income.   Thus,  the whole basis of the decision  has  been lost  and,  therefore,  the  order under  appeal  cannot  be sustained and deserves to be set aside. Shri  Dhruv  Mehta pointed out that by  an  artificial definition  introduced  into  the Act what  is  agricultural income  cannot  be  treated otherwise.  He  also  sought  to explain  the scheme of the entries in the different Lists of the Constitution in support of his contention. The  learned  counsel for the appellants  pointed  out that  under Article 366(1) of the Constitution agricultural income  has  the same meaning as defined  under  enactments relating  to  income  tax.  There is divergence  of  opinion amongst  the  High  Courts  as  to  the  effect  of  Section 2(14)(iii)  of the Act, as amended by Finance Act, 1970, and hence  the Parliament introduced the Explanation by  Finance Act, 1989 stating the meaning thereto which is in conformity with  the view expressed by some High Courts.  He submitted, therefore,  doubts arising as to interpretation by reason of conflict  of decisions of the High Courts is resolved by law and such a provision cannot be invalid. Inasmuch  as there is no challenge to the validity  of the  Explanation  to Section 2(1A) inserted into the Act  by Finance  Act,  1989,  we are afraid, we cannot  examine  the correctness  of  the  said submission.  We leave  open  this question  to  be raised for consideration in an  appropriate proceeding. In  the result, we allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court.  No order as to costs.","High Court considered effect of combined reading of Sections 2(1A) and 2(14) of the Income  Tax Act, 1961.

" J U D G M E N T MARKANDEY KATJU, J. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Himachal Pradesh High Court dated 28.5.1999 in RSA No. 99 of 1992. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The plaintiff-respondents filed a suit for possession of the land in question alleging that one Smt. Ram Ditti, widow of Data Ram was owner in possession of the said land and she died issueless in October, 1983 leaving behind the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs as the only heir.  It is alleged that the defendant-appellants had got a false and fabricated Will purporting to be of Smt. Ram Ditti prepared and on that basis got mutation in the revenue record with the connivance of the revenue officials and also obtained possession. The defendant-appellants contested the suit and it is alleged that the Will of Smt. Ram Ditti said to be executed in favour of the defendants on 29.6.1997, was a valid Will which was registered before the Sub-Registrar on 30.6.1967. The trial court dismissed the suit, but the first appellate court reversed that judgment and decreed the suit and the judgment of the first appellate court was upheld by the High Court. Both the first appellate court as well as the High Court have held that the burden was on the defendants who were the propounders of the Will  to remove any suspicious circumstances, but the defendant-appellants have failed to do so.  Various circumstances have been noticed by the first appellate court and the High Court in this connection and they came to the conclusion that there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the alleged Will said to have been executed by Smt. Ram Ditti, and the defendant-appellants have not been able to remove those suspicions. It is well settled in law that the burden is on the propounder of the Will to remove any suspicious circumstances. It is not necessary to go into all those suspicious circumstances referred to in the judgments of the High Court and the first appellate court. The finding of the High Court as well as the first appellate court is that there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the Will which is a finding of fact, and it cannot be said that this finding of fact is based on no evidence or is perverse.   We have gone through the entire record and we are satisfied that there is relevant material on the record in support of the said finding. We are, therefore, not inclined to interfere with the finding of fact http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 recorded by the first appellate court and the High Court. For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal.  The appeal is dismissed accordingly.

" O R D E R This  petition  is  against  an  order  dismissing  the application under  Order  1,  Rule  10,  CPC  filed  by  the petitioners to  come on record in place of their father. The suit was  laid for  specific performance  wherein the father during his  life  time  is  alleged  to  have  entered  into compromise  and  requested  to  delete  his  name  from  the arraignment of  the parties as respondent No.1. The deletion of the  first respondent  came to  be made after his demise. Pending  suit  before  compromise  memo  was  recorded,  the petitioners sought  to come on record under Order 1, Rule 10 being that they were necessary and proper parties. The trial Court recorded the finding that deletion had taken place and observed as under: ""At present  I am  not  giving  any finding with  respect of  Ext-6 and compromise petition in the light of an objections raised by petitioners in  their   other  two   petitions. Simply  I  have  stated  the  facts which are  available on  record. If these petitioners  are made parties in the  suit as prayed then dispute will arise  between petitioners and plaintiff  No.1   with  respect  of compromise and  Ext-6.  Its  result will be  that there will be dispute between  the   co-plaintiffs   with respect of  their right,  title and interest  in  suit  property.  This suit will turn into a regular title suit.

Suit   of   Specific performance of  contract  Can’t  be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 turned into  a regular  Title Suit. So, in my opinion these petitioners are  not   necessary   and   proper parties  under   Order  1  Rule  10 C.P.C. The trial  Court accordingly  held that the petitioners are neither  necessary nor  proper parties  to the  suit. On revision, the  High Court  upheld the same. Shri Sanyal, the learned counsel  for the  petitioners contended  that  their father had  not  signed  the  relinquishment  deed  and  the signatures appended  to it were not that of him. The deed of relinquishment said to have been signed by the father of the petitioners was  not genuine. These questions are matters to be  taken   into  consideration   in  the  suit  before  the relinquishment deed  and compromise  memo between  the other contesting respondents were acted upon and cannot be done in the absence of the petitioners. The share of the petitioners will be  effected and,  therefore, it  would prejudice their right, title and interest in the property, We cannot go into these questions  at this  stage. The trial Court has rightly pointed  that  the  petitioners  are  necessary  and  proper parties so  long as  the alleged relinquishment deed said to have been  signed by  the deceased father of the petitioners is on  record. It may not bind petitioners but whether it is true or  valid or binding on them and all questions which in the  present   suit  cannot   be  gone   into.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NOS.3957-3958 OF 2002 KAPADIA, J. These civil appeals are filed by the Department against decision dated 25.4.01 in Tax Appeal Nos.39 and 40 of 2001 delivered by Gujarat High Court. 2.      Two questions of law arise for determination in these civil appeals which are as follow: (1)     Whether ""commitment charges"" can be allowed as deduction under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961? (2)     Whether ""charges"" paid to COFACE is similar to payment of interest under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and, therefore, has to be allowed as deduction? 3.      Regarding question No.(1), we may state that assessee had borrowed Rs.30 crores (approximately) from IDBI which in turn was refinanced by COFACE which foreign company had charged interest, commitment charges and insurance charges payable by the assessee.  The said ""commitment charges"" was upfront payment.  We have also examined the contract between IDBI and the assessee.  In the case of Addl. Commr. of Income-tax v. Akkamamba Textiles Ltd. \026 (1997) 227 ITR 464, this Court has held that commission paid by the assessee to the banker and the insurance company was admissible deduction under Section 37 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.  To the same effect is the judgment of this Court in the case Commr. of Income-tax v. Sivakami Mills Ltd. \026 (1997) 227 ITR 465.  For the aforestated reasons, we answer question No.(1) in favour of the assessee and against the Department.  We may clarify that both the above judgments allows deductions under Section 37 of the 1961 Act and not under Section 36(1)(iii) of the 1961 Act.  In this case, the Tribunal has allowed the claim under Section 37 and not only Section 36(1)(iii), hence there is no infirmity therein. 4.      As regards question No.(2) is concerned it may be stated that the assessee established phosphoric Acid Project as an extension to its present business activities and for that purpose obtained foreign currency loan from IDBI which in turn was refinanced by COFACE subject to the assessee paying finance charges to COFACE which according to the assessee was similar to payment of interest.  The Department disallowed the said item on the ground that finance charges http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 paid to COFACE on foreign currency loan was in the nature of interest and commitment charges and since the charges have been paid in relation to the project of manufacturing phosphoric acid which did not commence production during the assessment year under consideration, the expenses incurred were capital in nature.  The Department also placed reliance in this connection on Explanation 8 to Section 43(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.  On facts and circumstances of this case, once the Department equated the charges payable to COFACE with interest, our judgment in the case of Dy. Commr. of Income Tax, Ahmedabad v. M/s. Core Health Care Ltd. in Civil Appeal Nos.3952-55 of 2002 comes in. Accordingly, the said question No.(2) is also answered in favour of the assessee and against the Department. 5.      Before concluding, we may also mention that in this case the finance charges paid by the assessee to COFACE have also been equated by the Department with commitment charges which, as stated above, are held to be revenue expenditure and deductible under Section 37 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 [See: Akkamamba Textiles Ltd. (supra) and Sivakami Mills Ltd. (supra)].  Therefore, on either counts the above question No.(2) is answered in favour of the assessee and against the Department. 6.

The  mandate of Section 433 Cr.P.C. enables the Government in an appropriate case to commute the  sentence of  a convict and to prematurely order his release  before expiry of the sentence as imposed by the courts. Clause (b) of Section 433, Cr.P.C. provides that the sentence of  imprisonment  for  life  may  be  commuted  for imprisonment for  a term  not exceeding  14 years  or  fine. Undisputedly, the  respondent had  not  completed  14  years sentence when  he  filed  the  petition  under  Section  482 Cr.P.C. seeking premature release. The direction of the High Court therefore  to prematurely  release the  respondent and set him  at liberty forthwith could not have been made. That apart, even  if the  High Court could give such a direction, it could  only direct cunsideration of the case of premature release by  the Government  and could  not have  ordered the premature release  of the  respondent itself.  The right  to exercise the  power under  Section 433  Cr.P.C. vests in the Government and  has to  be exercised  by the  Government  in accordance with  the rules  and established  principles. The impugned order  of  the  High  Court  cannot,  therefore  be sustained and is hereby set aside. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 This order  shall however,  not come in the way of  the respondent for  approaching the  Government for  term of the order issued  by the Governor of Punjab on March 6, 1985.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 4 of 1970. Appeal  from the Judgment & Decree dated the 14th  November, 1968 of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in R.F.A. Nos. 154 & 186 of 1964. 0. P. Sharma, for the appellant. Hardayal Hardey and P. P. Juneja, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAY,  C.J. This appeal by certificate turns on the  question as  to  whether the State gave the respondent  a  reasonable opportunity   as   contemplated  by  Article  311   of   the Constitution. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The  respondent  was a Sub Divisional  Officer.   The  State ordered a departmental enquiry against the respondent. The  respondent  filed  a suit for a  declaration  that  the dismissal of the respondent was illegal.  One of he  grounds challenging  the  order  of dismissal  was  that  copies  of statements   recorded  by  the  police  in  the  course   of investigation  of the witnesses proposed to be  examined  at the  departmental enquiry were not supplied by the State  to the respondent in spite of the request in that behalf. The  trial Court found that copies of the statements of  the witnesses as recorded by the Vigilance Department during the preliminary enquiry were not supplied to the respondent  but only  the synopsis was given.  The trial  Court,  therefore, held  that  no  reasonable  opportunity  was  given  to  the respondent. 371 The High Court upheld the decision. The State contended that the respondent was not entitled  to get  copies  of statements. The reasoning of the  State  was that  the  respondent  was given the  opportunity  to  cross examine  the witnesses and during the cross-examination  the respondent  would  have the opportunity of  confronting  the witnesses  with  the statements. It is  contended  that  the synopsis  was adequate to acquaint the respondent  with  the gist of the evidence. The  meaning  of a reasonable opportunity of  showing  cause against  the  action  proposed  to  be  taken  is  that  the Government  servant is afforded a reasonable opportunity  to defend himself against charges on which inquiry is held. The Government  servant should be given an opportunity  to  deny his guilt and establish his innocence. He can do so when  he is  told what the charges against him are. ’He can do so  by cross  examining  the witnesses produced  against  him.  The object  of  supplying  statements  is  that  the  Government servant will be able to refer to the previous statements  of the witnesses proposed to be examined against the Government servant.  Unless the statements are given to the  Government servant he will not be able to have an effective and  useful cross-examination. It  is  unjust  and unfair to deny  the  Government  servant copies   of   statements  of   witnesses   examined   during investigation and produced at the inquiry in support of  the charges levelled against the Government servant. A  synopsis does  not satisfy the requirements of giving the  Government servant  a reasonable opportunity of showing  cause  against the action proposed to be taken. For  these reasons the appeal is dismissed. The  State  will pay costs to the respondent. P.B.R.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI, J. The appellant  was convicted  by the  trial  court  for causing death  of one  Sanjeevan. His  conviction was  based upon the evidence of P.Ws 1 and 2 who were accompanying t he deceased and P.W. 3 who had seen the deceased and P.Ws 1 and 2 going  together on the road. The trial court held that the evidence  of   P.Ws  1   and  2   deserved  to  be  accepted particularly when  it was  corroborated by  the evidence  of P.W. 3 who was an independent witness. The High  Court on  reappreciation of the evidence also came to  the conclusion  that the  evidence of  P.Ws 1 and 2 deserved to be accepted. The High Court has rightly observed that merely  because P.Ws  1 and  2  were the friends of the deceased  and possibly belonged to the same political party, their evidence  could not  have been discarded on the ground that they  were partisan  witnesses. The High Court was also right in  rejecting the  contention that  P.Ws 1 and 2 could not have  seen the  incident from  the place where they were standing when  knife blows  were given  to the deceased. The High Court  also rightly  rejected the  contention that  the prosecution had  changed the  place of incident as there was no substance  in it. It has given good reasons in support of its finding.  We see  no good  reason  to  differ  from  the findings recorded by the High Court. It was lastly contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court having disbelieved the evidence of P.Ws 1 and 2 regarding  A.2 and  A.3 ,  ought not  to have  accepted it against A.1  also A.2 and A.3 were given benefit of doubt as there was  no clear  evidence regarding  the role  played by them when  the  deceased  was  given  knife  blows  by  A.1. Therefore, acquittal of A.2 and A.3 by the High Court cannot be of any help to A.1. We, therefore,  see no  reason to  interfere  with  the judgment and  order passed by the High Court.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 21033 of 2005) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 23.5.2005 passed by a Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench. A brief reference to the factual aspect would suffice. The appellant filed the writ petition challenging the order dated 16.9.2004 and notice dated 16.9.2004 issued by the Additional Collector (Stamps) Jaipur.  The demand raised by the State of Rajasthan was in respect of alleged revenue loss caused by the appellant to the State Government by its purchasing stamps from other State i.e. Maharashtra. The writ petition was dismissed by learned Single Judge on the ground of availability of alternative remedy.  Appellant filed the Special Appeal questioning correctness of the order passed by the learned Single Judge.  Along with Special Appeal an application for stay was also filed.  The Special Appeal was disposed of with the direction to the respondent- State to constitute a High Power Committee to resolve the dispute.  The High Power Committee by its order dated 27.4.2005 held that the appellant is liable to pay to the State of Rajasthan a sum of Rs.576.72 lakhs   Appellant filed an application for revival of the Special Appeal and revival of the interim direction passed in the said appeal.  Though initially the application was dismissed, subsequently the same was revived.  Dealing with the said application it was noted by the High Court by order dated 11.12.2004 that the demand of Rs.1,19,75,000/- made against the appellant does not exceed the loan advanced by the appellant-Corporation to the State of Rajasthan.  Liberty was given to the State of Rajasthan to adjust the amount of its demand against the loan advanced by the appellant- Corporation to the State Government. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 (in short the ’Act’) does not in reality authorize the demand as has been made in the present case. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted that the provisions contained in the aforesaid Act clearly permit the action as taken by the authority. Since the matter is pending consideration of the High Court it would not be proper for us to decide the issues on merits though learned counsel for the parties made a request in that regard.  It would be appropriate if the High Court hears the matter expeditiously, considering the importance to the issues involved regarding the permissibility of the levy and the manner adopted. Undisputedly several divisions of the appellant-Corporation in Rajasthan purchase stamps from Maharashtra.  Stand of the State Government is that purchase of stamps from outside Rajasthan was against the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.  The view expressed was that officers of the appellant-Corporation would purchase stamps from the Rajasthan treasuries only. In the circumstances, the High Court is requested to take up the Special Appeal for disposal expeditiously.  The High Court is also requested to explore the possibility to dispose of the matter by the end of August, 2007.  Needless to say the decision of the High Court shall be uninfluenced by the view taken by the High Power Committee.  The interim order dated 24.10.2005 passed by this Court shall continue to be operative till disposal of the matter by the High Court.  It is made clear that it shall not be construed that we have expressed no opinion on the merits by granting interim protection as afore- noted. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 18890/07) Leave granted. In this appeal two following questions arises for determination : (a)    Whether the  Police officials appointed in the Bureau of Investigation shall continue to retain their power and authority under Cr.PC.?  In other words, whether after lodgment of FIR alleging commission of offences under West Bengal Sales Tax Act,1994 and IPC?  whether Police officials attached to the Bureau of Investigation, lose their power and authority to carry out investigation as regards alleged criminal offences. (b) Whether the words \023Proceedings triable\024 contained in Section 6(2) of the West Bengal Taxation Tribunal Act, 1987 covers proceedings commencing from the beginning of the trial and not proceedings after lodgment of FIR? As regards the first question, the matter stand disposed of in terms of the Judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of State of West Bengal Vs. Narsayan K. Patodia reported in 2000(4)SCC 447. As regards question No.2, we quote hereinbelow the observation made by the Tribunal at page 43 which reads as under: \023As regular offences created by the Act of 11994 this Tribunal has jurisdiction, power and authority excepting that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to try such offence inasmuch as it will be tried, if necessary, by the prescribed Court in accordance with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. Upto the stage of prior to commencement of trial, this Tribunal has jurisdiction to interfere but it may not or should not interfere if any competent Criminal Court is in scisin of the case and has passed orders unless there is grave error of law and manifest injustice.\024 At the same time we also quote hereinbelow the principles formulated by the Tribunal in the matter of its jurisdiction power and authority over investigation enquiry or proceedings conducted under Cr.PC. (1)      This Tribunal does not have any jurisdiction, power and authority over any investigation, enquiry or proceedings conducted under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in respect of alleged or suspected offences under the Indian Penal Code. (2)        This Tribunal has jurisdiction, power and authority to entertain lawful grievances against conduct, actions and or inactions of the persons dealing with any alleged or suspected offence under the provisions of the W.B. Sales Tax Act,1994, till a competent criminal court takes cognizance of the offence and proceeds to try the offence. On reading the aforestated paragraphs from the decision of the Tribunal, we find that while setting out the principles, the Tribunal has correctly stated that it does not have jurisdiction, power and authority over any investigation, enquiry or proceedings conducted under Criminal Proceedings Code in respect of IPC alleged offences.  To this extent the proposition is correct.  However, at page 43 of the SLP, the Tribunal has stated that upto the stage of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 commencement of the trial it has jurisdiction to interfere. This  is not the correct proposition.  In our view the observation at page 43 of the SLP paper book made by the Tribunal is unsustainable and untenable  if one keeps in mind the scheme of Sections 154 and 156 of the Crl. Procedure Code. To that extent appeal is allowed partly.

Mohan, T. Raja and R. Nedumaran for the Respondent. 891 The following Order of the Court was delivered: Ten  acres of land belonging to the appellant had  been acquired   under   the  Land  Acquisition  Act.   The   Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation at the rate of  one rupee one paise per sq. ft. On a reference under section  18 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of  the Act, the Court enhanced the rate of compensation  to Rs. 2.25 per sq. ft. On appeal by the State, the High  Court by  the  impugned judgment reduced the compensation  to  Rs. 2.00 per sq. ft. The reason stated by the High Court for so reducing the rate  of  compensation  was that the  acquired  area  was  a compact  plot  of 10 acres which was laid  out  as  building sites  with fully formed roads and drainage. The High  Court held  that since the roads and drainage occupied a  part  of the  area acquired, proportionate  deduction in compensation ought to be made. Counsel  for  the  appellant  submits  that  what   was acquired was a compact area of 10 acres. The fact that roads and drainage had been laid out does not reduce the value  of the  land  acquired.  In fact  the  appellant  had  incurred expenditure in preparing the land as building sites, and the High Court ought to have accepted his contention that he was entitled to higher compensation. We see no reason why the High Court should have reduced the  compensation  awarded  by the Reference  Court  on  the ground  that roads and drainage had been laid out. The  fact that these improvements had been made on the land shows that what was acquired was more valuable than what it would  have been without the improvements. The reason given by the  High Court for reducing the compensation awarded by the Reference Court was wrong in principle. Accordingly, we set aside  the impugned judgment of the High Court and restore that of  the Reference Court. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. No Costs.

We have heard learned counsel for the appellant. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the learned single Judge of the High Court of Madras, mad on September 1, 1996 in SA No.2235/83. The appellant had filed a suit for declaration of title and for  perpetual injunction.  The contention raised by the appellant was  that the  property being  an  estate  he  has perfected his  title thereto. The case of the respondents is that it  is a  Pavadi land  and after  the abolition  of the estate,  it   stood  vested  in  the  State  free  from  all encumbrances. All  the courts  below have concurrently found that the  appellant has  no title to the property but he was in possession  of the property. Accordingly, a direction was given to  have him ejected in accordance with law. After the judgment was  rendered by  the High  Court, the  notice  was given to the appellant on September 1, 1995 and they refused to receive  the notice. As a result, on 2.9.1995, notice was served on  the appellant by affixture and possession thereof was taken on 9.9.1995 under the provisions of Section 339(2) of the  Tamil Nadu Municipal Act. Thus the land stood vested in the  State after  due ejectment  by the  appellant.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2402 OF 2002 Aggrieved by the order dated 15/11/2000, this appeal has been preferred by the U.P. Public Service Commission. Heard the parties. Briefly stated, the facts are as follows. Sometimes in the year 1983, an advertisement was issued for filling up posts of 301 Naib Tehsildar.  Result was declared on 22/9/1988.  In the said result, 297 candidates were recommended and appointed.  Subsequently, 40 recommended candidates did not join their post within the stipulated time and 6 appointees resigned.  Thus, 46 posts became vacant.  For the 46 subsequent vacancies, the department again recommended 46 candidates from the waiting listed.  The break-up of 46 candidates are as follows: 32 general candidates, 6 OBC and 8 .....2. - 2 - SC candidates.  All of them were appointed.  It appears that the respondents herein preferred a writ petition in February 1992 claiming their appointment from the waiting list. In paragraph 28 of the writ petition, allegation has been made that the respondents 1 to 3, the appellants herein, have committed illegality in giving appointment to the 12 persons who have not even appeared in the examination and they were not in the merit list and as such their appointment is wholly illegal and is liable to be cancelled.  Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the appellants rebutting the said contention.  Be that as it may.  The allegation in paragraph 28 of the writ petition was as vague as anything. The name of none of the 12 persons, who were alleged to have been appointed despite the fact that they did not appear in the examination, has been mentioned, save and except, making bald statement. They were not made parties. Also it is not the case of the respondents that they were high in the waiting list and ignoring their candidature, the persons, who were below them in the waiting list, have been appointed. By now it is well-settled principles of law that even a recommended candidate does not possess any indefeasible right.  No enforceable right has accrued even to the recommended candidates.  The case  of the respondents was still worse.  It .........3. - 3 - is contended that the respondents, who filed writ petition, were far below than the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 candidates who have been appointed from the waiting list.  The High Court on such bald allegation issued a writ of mandamus to the appellants for appointment of the respondent Nos. 3 and 4. The order of the High Court is clearly not in accordance with law.

Under annexure ’A’ to the notification  it was stated that the area falling within a radius  of 8  kms. from  the plots specified in Schedule B are within  the  notified  area.    In  schedule  B  it  was mentioned that  the area  comprising in  Attabira and Bheden Police Station  in the  District of Sambalpur are within the notified  area.     It   is  now   seen  that  the  villages Saharatikira and  Bheden are  situated  within  the  8  kms. radius from  the aforesaid  police stations.

" J U D G M E N T We have heard counsel for the parties. This appeal by special leave is directed against the order of High Court of Delhi in Regular Second Appeal No.12 of 1999 dated 12th April, 1999 whereby the High Court dismissed the Second Appeal preferred by the appellant on a finding that there was no substantial question of law involved in the Second Appeal. The Second Appeal arose from a suit filed by landlord-respondent for perpetual and mandatory injunction against the appellants alleging that they had carried out certain structural changes in the premises let out to the ...2/- -2- appellant whereby the premises were substantially damaged and some parts of the building developed cracks, it being an old building. It is not necessary for us to refer in detail to the allegations made in the plaint. After examining the evidence the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff had proved his case and this was a fit case for grant of permanent injunction. Accordingly, on 31.3.1998, the learned Civil Judge passed a decree of mandatory injunction. Against the decree passed by the Trial Court an appeal was preferred before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi. By judgment and order dated 19.12.1998 the said appeal was dismissed. The appellant then preferred a Second Appeal before the High Court of Delhi being Regular Second Appeal  No.12 of 1999 which, as earlier noticed, was dismissed by the High Court on a finding that no substantial question of law was involved in the Second Appeal. Thereafter the petitioner preferred a special leave petition and after ...3/- -3- grant of special leave this appeal has been placed before us for disposal. After hearing the parties and going through the material placed before us we concur with the finding of the High Court that this case does not involve any substantial question of law which deserved consideration under Section 100 CPC. All the findings recorded by the Courts below are either pure findings of fact or at best mixed question of law and fact. It has been found as a fact by the Courts below that the floor of the shop was sought to be changed and in that process the level of the floor has been brought down one feet below the road level. Similarly certain alterations were made in the structure by removing pillars with a view to give a wider frontage to suit the convenience of the appellant. On the findings arrived at by the Courts below, no substantial question of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 law arises.

We, therefore, find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly, dismissed. ...4/- -4- Counsel for the appellants submitted before us that he is willing to obey the decree of the Courts below and comply with the directions contained therein.

" ORDER 1.   The short question of law that arises for consideration in this appeal is if the High Court was right in its finding that  the  appellants were liable to be proceeded  with  and were  not  liable to be discharged on the  second  complaint filed  under  Section  494  IPC, for  which  they  had  been convicted and sentenced earlier. 2.   Appellant  1 is said to have married appellant  2.  The wife  of  appellant 2 one Promila filed  a  complaint  under Section 494 IPC, in which the appellants were convicted  and sentenced  to undergo simple imprisonment for two years  and fine of Rs 2000 each and in default of the payment of fine I further  period of six months’ imprisonment.   Subsequently, Respondent 1, who claims to be husband of appellant 1, filed the  present complaint against appellants 1 and 2 and  other relations, who too were parties in the first complaint.  The appellants  claimed that since they had been  convicted  for the  offence, they were liable to be discharged.  The  trial court  dismissed  the application against which  they  filed revision.   The  High Court maintained tile order  and  held that  the benefit of Section 300 of the  Criminal  Procedure Code was not available as the facts were not the same. 3.   Sub-section (1) of Section 300 CrPC bars a second trial for the same offence.  The High Court itself found that  the offence was the same yet it dismissed the application of the appellants  for  discharging them as facts  were  not  same. Sub-section (1) of Section 300 CrPC reads as under: 657 ""300. (1) A person who has once been tried  by a  Court  of  competent  jurisdiction  for  an offence  and  convicted or acquitted  of  such offence  a  shall, while  such  conviction  or acquittal  remains in force, not be liable  to be  tried again for the same offence,  nor  on the same facts for any other offence for which http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 a  different charge from the one made  against him might have been made under sub-section (1) of  Section  221, or for which he  might  have been convicted under sub-section (2) thereof."" It shall be seen that it bars a fresh trial if a person  had been  tried  and  convicted  or  acquitted  by  a  court  of competent  Jurisdiction  for the same offence.   Offence  is defined  by clause (n) of Section 2 of the CrPC to mean  ,an act  or omission made punishable by the Act’.   The  offence for which the appellants were tried earlier was the  offence of  bigamy  under  Section  494  IPC.   The  second   trial, therefore,  may  be  at  the  instance  of  the  husband  of appellant 1 is clearly barred by Section 300 CrPC, as it  is for  the  same  offence.  The High Court,  in  our  opinion, misdirected itself in recording the finding that facts being different, except the alleged marriage the second  complaint was  liable  to  be  proceeded with.  We  do  not  find  any distinction  on  facts except that the first  complaint  was filed by the first wife of the husband and second  complaint has  been filed by the husband of the wife, appellant 1  who is said to have remarried appellant 2. The offence of bigamy is  committed when a husband or wife in the lifetime of  his spouse  marries.  When a person is tried and  convicted  for such an offence on the complaint of a person, authorised  by law  to  do so, he or she cannot be prosecuted and  tried  a second time for the same offence on another complaint  filed by  another person.  The bar under Section 300 is for  trial and  conviction of the same offence.  Since offence  remains the same the appellants cannot be tried and convicted for it once again. 4.   In  the  result, this appeal succeeds and  is  allowed. The  order passed by the High Court and the  Magistrate  are set aside.  The appellants shall stand discharged. 658","Appellants were convicted and sentenced under Section 494 IPC for bigamy.

" THE 10TH DAY OF MAY, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.B.Pattanaik C.B.Babu, B Krishna Prasad and P.Parmeshwaran, Advs. for the appellants. O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Union of India & Ors. V. M/s. Sharma Coal Co. O R D E R Leave granted. Though the  respondents have  been served, none appears either in  person or  through the  counsel.  We  have  heard counsel for the appellant. This appeal arises from the order of the Division Bench of the  Guwahati High  Court in  a batch  of writ  petitions being Civil  Rule No.1153/83  and batch passed on dated July 30,  1990.   The  Railway   administration  had  prepared  a preferential traffic  scheme (PTS),  by general  order No.71 categorizing the  priority articles for carriage by railways and  allotted   different  priorities   which  are  made  in alphabetic orders  A  to  E.  Sponsored  coal  movement  was mentioned in  Category  C  priority  and  priority  E  would include  non-sponsored  coal.  Subsequently  by  proceedings dated March 1, 1989 the Railways modified its earlier scheme and issued general PTS Order No.77 with effect from April 1, 1989 under  which priorities  were  redetermined.  It  would appear that  subsequently non-priorities  coal  item  E  was deleted from  the priority  scheme. When the respondents and others challenged  its validity  on the anvil of Art.19 ( g) of the  Constitutions the  Division Bench  of the High Court without disturbing  the validity  of  the  order  had  given direction observing that after all the priorities enumerated in the  scheme are  exhausted  and  if  the  wagons  remains http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 unutilised,  the  unutilised  wagons  may  be  kept  at  the disposal of  non-priority articles  for carriage.  Thus this appeal came to be filed by special leave. It is  seen that  in order No.75 priorities A to E were made which included sponsored coal within the meaning of the order and non-sponsored coal within the meaning of the order and non-sponsored  coal provided in priority E for allotment of  wagon.   With  regard   to  non-Priority   item  E,   it subsequently deleted  as mentioned  in paragraph  E  of  the special leave  petition  which  reads  as  the  Order  No.77 relates to PTS for allotment of wagons which came into force from 16.7.86. but non sponsored coat referred to in priority E of PTS No.75 was removed"". It would thus be seen that non- priority  coal  came  to  be  removed  from  the  priorities mentioned in  Items  A  to  E.  Therefore,  the  High  Court obviously was  of the  intention to direct that if after the wagons allotted  for movement  to priority articles remained available,  the   same  may  be  allotted  for  non-priority articles for  carriage. We  do not  think that  there is any impediment  in  the  way  of  administration  to  give  such allotment, instead  of keeping  them idle.  It would  be  in commercial interest of the Railway administration. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.",Union of India & Ors. V. M/s. Sharma Coal Co. O R D E R Leave granted. No costs.

The H igh Court confirmed their conviction.  All the convicted accused then filed a  Special leave petition  in  this  court.    Leave was not granted to Kashmir Singh.  It was granted to the appellants only. The prosecution case against  the  appellants  was  that  on 31.8.88  at  about  6.00  p.m.,  they  went  to the house of Bhagwan Singh and enquired from him whether he  was  willing or not to vacate the house in his possession.  Bhagwan Singh told  them  that  as he was the real owner of the house, the question of vacating it did not  arise.    There  upon,  the appellants  exhorted  Kashmir singh to finish Bhagwan Singh. Kashmir Singh fired two shots from his  pistol  and  causeed injuries to Bhagwan Singh and Malkiat S ingh. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined the two injured eye-witnesses  and  also  led other evidence.  After appreciating their evidence, the trial court thought it safe to rely upon it and also upon the evidence of Lattkan  singh -  P.W.7  and  Jagir  Singh  - P.W.8, who hadd rushed to the place of the incident on hearing the cries of  the  injured. The  trial  court disbelieved tthe defence case that someone else and fired at them and caused  injuries  and  that  they were falsely  involved  because  o  f property dispute.  The trial court convicted them as stated above. The High Court on re-appreciation  of  the  evidence  agreed with  findings recorded by the trial court and confirmed the conviction. What was urged by the learned counsel for the appellant  was that  the  evidence  of  the  eye-witnesses was not properly appreciated by  courts  below  and  the  reasons  given  for accepting their evidence inspite of many infirmities therein are not  proper.    H  aving gone through their evidence, we find that it does not suffer  from  any  serious  infirmity. Their  evidence was correctly appreciated by the trial court and the High Court was  right  in  confirming  the  findings recorded by the trial court.  All the three accused had gone http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 together  to  the  house  of  Bhagwan Singh and the way they acted thereafter leaves  no  doubt  about  their  acting  in furtherance of  theeir  common intention.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted Heard learned counsel on both sides. The respondent  while in  service as Extra-Departmental Agent  was   charge-sheeted,  for  misconduct  of  temporary absence from  duty,  under  Rule  8  of  the  P  &  T  Extra Departmental Agents  (Conduct and  Services) Rules,  1964 on June 6,  1985. By order dated March 31,1986, the enquiry was cancelled  and   fresh  enquiry  was  conducted.  Later,  on conclusion of the departmental enquiry proceedings, by order dated July 9, 1990, the respondent was removed from service. He filed  an application in the Tribunal. By order dated May 28,   1992,   the   Tribunal   remitted   the   matter   for reconsideration on  the nature of punishment. That order was unsuccessfully challenged  in  this  Court  and  had  become final. Subsequently,  when the  order of  removal was passed again, it  was challenged  in the  Tribunal. The Tribunal by order dated  September 4,  1993 quashed  the proceedings and directed reconsideration of the quantum of punishment on the basis of  amended rules.  Again, it  was challenged  in  the special  leave   petition  before   this  Court   which  was dismissed. Consequently,  the respondent  was reinstated. He again filed  an application.  In the  impugned  order  dated December 5,  1995 made  in O.A.  No.787/94, the Tribunal has directed payment  of  back-wages.  Thus,  these  appeals  by special leave. This  Court   in   Rajasthan   State   Road   Transport Corporation vs.  Bhagyo Mal  & Ors.  [194 supp.(l)  SCC 573] held  that   while  the   High  Court  had  found  that  the respondent-employee deserved  punishment on  account of  his misconduct, and  awarded lesser punishment, it is not liable to grant  back-wages  particularly  when  the  Tribunal  had converted the  order  of  dismissal  into  stoppage  of  two increments with  cumulative effect.  Therefore, the order of the High  Court was  set aside  to that  effect. It  is  now settled law  that  imposition  of  punishment    is  in  the discretion of  the disciplinary authority. But the authority is expected  to exercise the discretion properly taking into consideration all  the relevant  facts and circumstances. In http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 this case,  the punishment  of removal  was found  to be not justified for the reason that the respondent was temporarily absent from  duty. But  the order  of dismissal  having been converted into  one of reinstatement with lesser punishment, the question  arises whether  the respondent  is entitled to back-wages? The  Tribunal was not right in directing payment of back-wages  for the  reason that the respondent was found to be  responsible for  misconduct though  lesser punishment was imposed.  Under these  circumstances and  following  the above judgment,  we hold that the respondent is not entitled to back wages. The appeals are accordingly allowed. No costs.","The respondent, while in service as Extra-Departmental Agent, was charge-sheeted for misconduct of temporary absence from duty.

" JUDGMENT ORDER 1. We have heard counsel for the Parties. 2. It is no doubt true that the High Court felt persuaded to grant bail to the respondents in the pending appeal before it. The High Court, however, went on to record a very detailed reasoned order virtually holding that the prosecution case has no merit. Such observations either for or against the prosecution, made in orders disposing of bail applications may prejudicially affect the interest of the parties because in case a trial is pending before the Sessions Court, the Trial Judge may consider itself bound by the observations made in such an order. In any event such observations are bound to influence its mind. It is no doubt true that in appropriate cases particularly in serious matters, the High Court may record reasons, but the High Court while recording reasons must take care to safeguard against prejudicing the case of the parties. The recording of reasons, wherever necessary, is only to indicate the considerations that may have weighed with the Court in passing the order and the Court must do so in a manner that may not prejudice the case of the parties. The trend recently noticed, to virtually write a judgment while disposing of an application for grant of bail must be discouraged. 3. While not upsetting the order passed by the High Courts, we observe that the findings recorded in the Order granting bail ought to be eschewed when the appeal itself is taken up for hearing. 4. The Special leave Petitions are disposed of accordingly.","High Court recorded a very detailed reasoned order virtually holding that the prosecution case has no merit.

This appeal arises out of an order of a Bench  of Centrol  Administrative  Tribunal,  Madras,  dismissing   an application  filed by the appellant herein.  The  prayer  in the application was to consider and appoint the appellant to the  Indian Administrative Service (hereinafter referred  to as  ‘IAS’) for the year 1990.  It appears that for the  year 1990 the appellant was one of the five candidates called for interview  for selection to the I.A.S. from among  the  Non- State Civil Service Officers in the State of Tamil Nadu.  It seems   to   be  common  ground  that   under   the   Indian Administrative     Service   (Appointment   by    Selection) Regulations,  1956, read with similar  Regulations,  namely, Indian  Administrative Service (Appointment  by  Promotion), Regulations,  1955 persons not belonging to the State  Civil Service,  who are of outstanding merit and ability  and  who have completed not less than eight years of services, can be considered  for appointment to the I.A.S. by selection.   In the   case   of  the  appellant  the   Selection   Committee interviewed  the appellant along with four other  candidates recommending  their  names  to  the  Union  Public   Service Commission  for approval.  In this rating process  three  of the  members of the Select Committee rated the appellant  as ""outstanding  "" whereas the other two members rated  him  as ""very  good"".  By curious process of logic, which we find  a little  difficult  to understand,  the  Selection  Committee declined  to  recommend his name for  consideration  on  the ground that there was no ‘consensus’ regarding his ability. In  our view it is clear that if out of five  committee members three ranked the appellant as ""outstanding"" and  two as  ‘very  good’,  the  result  would  be  that  there   was definitely consensus that he was at least ""very 1074 good""  and  in  fact a little  better.   Therefore,  in  our opinion,  there  was no reason why his case could  not  have been  put up for consideration by the Union  Public  service Commission.   The  Central  Administrative  Tribunal,   with respect,  was in error in dismissing the application of  the appellant as it did.  We direct the case of the appellant to be  put  up for consideration by the  Union  Public  Service Commission  for  appointment in the vacancy of 1990  on  the footing of the consensus as we have set out earlier. The  appeal  is allowed as  aforestated.   There  will, however, be no order as to costs. T.N.A.                                      Appeal allowed. 1075","Appellant was one of the five candidates called for interview for selection to the I.A.S. from among the Non- State Civil Service Officers in the State of Tamil Nadu.

" O R D E R This appeal  by  special  leave  arises  from  the judgment of  the Punjab  & Haryana High Court in R.S.A. No.878  of   1964  dated   September  27,   1976.   The appellants/plaintiffs were non-suited by the High Court on  the   finding  that   the  sale  deed  was  without consideration  (Ex.P-1)   executed  and  registered  on September 29,  1959. Shri  S.K.  Gambhir,  the  learned counsel for  the appellants contended that the question whether  consideration   has  been  passed  is  a  pure question of  fact. The appellate Court having gone into that aspect  as Court  of fact  and  having  entered  a finding, reversal thereof by the High Court is illegal. It is  not in  dispute that in the suit the respondents contended that  the sale  deed was  obtained by  fraud, misrepresentation and  without consideration. The trial Court dismissed  the suit. But on appeal, the appellate Court reversed  the finding and held that neither fraud nor   misrepresentation    was   made   out.   Adequate consideration  was   passed  under   the   sale   deed. Therefore, it  is a  valid sale  deed. The  High  Court after considering  the evidence  ultimately recorded  a finding that  there is no proof that the appellants had paid the  consideration. In that behalf, the High Court has  looked   into  the   accounts  maintained  by  the appellant himself and it is stated thus: ""that no  evidence has  been led by the respondents/appellants  to show that Rs.2350/-  were  due  to  them from the  appellants/respondents on the basis  of  Bahi’s  account  and bonds. It  has also not been proved by the  respondents that the amount of Rs.1650/-  was paid  by them  to the appellants."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 On the  basis of  the said finding, the High Court has reversed  the decree  of the  appellate  Court  and confirmed, though  for different reasons, the decree of the trial  Court. Though  normally the High Court might not have  interfered with  the finding  recorded by the appellate Court,  in view  of the  diverse views by the trial Court and the appellate Court, the High Court was impelled  to  go  into  the  question  and  recorded  a finding.   The    material   evidence    and   relevant circumstances  were   not  adverted  to  by  the  first appellate Court.  The High  Court, therefore,  had done that exercise.

SURESH KUMAR                               PETITIONER(S) VERSUS CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION         RESPONDENT(S) TRANSFER PETITION (CRL.) NO.216 OF 2007 We have heard learned counsel for the parties. This Transfer Petition has been filed by the petitioner for transfer of the criminal proceedings/trial which was scheduled to commence from 30.7.2007 before the Sessions Judge, Port Blair, Andaman & Nicobar Islands pursuant to case bearing G.R. Case No.4650 of 2003 titled Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands through CBI versus K.C. Suresh Kumar pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Port Blair to the competent Court of jurisdiction at Madras. -2- The grievance of the petitioner is that since the murder of a lawyer, T. Vasantha Secretary of bar  has taken place and the accused is facing trial under Section 302 IPC , the atmosphere is charged with emotion and no member of bar is prepared to appear for accused, therefore, the accused will not get proper justice.  It is further submitted that it will not be fair to allow this trial to continue at Port Blair.  Therefore, it is prayed that the trial may be transferred either to Tamil Nadu or to Calcutta. Mr. Vikas Singh, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the respondent-CBI seriously oppose the request for transfer of the petition to either of the two places.  He has produced before us some of the proceedings to show that the accused was not willing to take any legal assistance provided by the Court.  Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has invited our attention to a decision of this Court in the case of Sri Jayendra Saraswathy Swamigal(II), T.N. versus State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.  reported in 2005(8) SCC 711.  He submits that apprehension of the accused that he is not likely to get a fair trial,  should be a good ground to transfer the trial from one place to another. We fully agree with the contention raised by Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi that the accused should get a fair trial and he should be provided assistance and right to defend himself -3- under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  Mr. Vikas Singh, learned ASG submits that there are sixty witnesses to be examined and if the case is transferred, practically it will be difficult to complete the trial. Be that as it may, we consider it proper that the accused should get a fair trial an http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 d he should also be represented by a counsel of his choice.  Therefore, we direct that the accused may name the counsel of his choice either from Calcutta or from Madras or from any other part of the country.  The expenses for legal assistance shall be borne by the respondent-CBI so that the accused should not feel that he did not get a fair trial in the matter. In this view of the matter, we are not inclined to interfere in this transfer petiti on. However, it is directed that the accused shall give the name of a counsel of his choice to the CBI.  The CBI shall reimburse the expenses and also the fee which should be reasonable, to the counsel of the accused. The Transfer Petition is accordingly, disposed of. We hope and trust that the members of the Bar will keep their cool and will not vitiate the atmosphere of fair trial.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 4982 of 2005) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in a Writ Petition filed by respondent No.6-Vijay Kumar Singh. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: A Writ Petition was filed by the appellants questioning the legality of the proceeding initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short the ’Act’) in which their lands were sought to be acquired. In the said Writ Petition, father of respondent No.6 Bam Bahadur Singh was respondent No.6. According to the appellants aforesaid Bam Bahadur Singh had entered appearance in the said writ petition. One Fudena Rai filed a writ petition which is numbered as CWJC No. 2862 of 2004. In the said writ petition a prayer inter-alia was made to the effect that the respondents therein should be commanded by a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or writs, order or orders to construct the road for which the land has been acquired. In the said writ petition the present appellants were not parties. However, the same was being heard almost on the same day when the writ petition filed by the appellants i.e. W.P. 3232/2004 was being heard. The writ petition to which the present appeal relates is numbered as CWJC No. 8674 of 2004 and was styled as ""Public Interest Litigation"".  It is the appellants’ case that the petition was nothing but a mischievously designed attempt to harass the appellants. The writ petition was also a verbatim copy of the writ petition filed by Fudena Rai i.e. W.P. No.2862 of 2004. While the appellants’ writ petition and Fudena Rai’s writ petition were pending, by the impugned order the same has been disposed of, a day after it was filed.  The order is a short one and reads as follows: ""The grievance of the petitioner is that the land has been acquired but no steps are being http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 taken for construction of the road. In our view, the petitioner should approach the District Magistrate, Vaishali at Hajippur who will look into the matter and see that if the fund is available under any agency or the Gram Panchayat is ready to construct out of its own fund, then he will issue necessary direction in this regard. If there is any encroachment on the land, the District Magistrate, Vaishali at Hajipur will also take steps for removal of the same. With the aforesaid observation, the writ application stands disposed of."" According to the appellants there is virtually a direction for construction of a road on the land the acquisition of which is under challenge. It is submitted that subsequently CWJC No.2862 of 2004 was referred to the Division Bench and was dismissed. In response, learned counsel for the State of Bihar  and respondent No.6 submitted that the impugned order passed by the Division Bench is rather innocuous and in no way affects the appellants. Though the order appears to be innocuous, there are certain aspects which need to be highlighted. Obviously, the direction was for construction by the District Magistrate, Vaishali, Hajippur or the Gram Panchayat. There was no indication that the same was to be governed by the decision in the writ petition challenging the acquisition proceedings. If the High Court would have mentioned that these directions were to be carried out after the disposal of the writ petition challenging the acquisition proceedings there would not have been any difficulty. In the aforesaid background, we feel it would be appropriate to direct the High Court to dispose of the pending writ petition CWJC No. 3232 of 2004. The direction in the impugned order for construction would be operative after the disposal of the aforesaid writ petition depending upon the decision in the said writ petition. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.",The appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in a Writ Petition filed by respondent No.6-Vijay Kumar Singh.

The Land  Acquisition officer  made  his award on  October  12,  1972  awarding  compensation  @  Rs. 1,000/- per acre. On reference, the civil Court enhanced the compensation to  Rs.2,000/- per  acre by  award  and  decree dated February 18, 1977.

This appeal  is only in respect of awarding of enhanced benefits under  Sections 23  [2], 28 end 23 [1A] of the Act. In view  of the settled legal position that the award of the civil  Court   was  made   long  before   the  date  of  the introduction of  the Amendment  Act 68 of 1984, the claimant is not  entitled to the enhanced benefits. That apart, it is also settled  legal position  that  the  High  Court,  while dismissing the  appellant’s appeal,  had no  jurisdiction to award the  additional benefits  since the  claimants did not file any  appeal for  further enhancement. Therefore, in the absence of  award additional compensation being awarded, the High Court  has no  jurisdiction to award the benefits under the provisions Of the Amendment Act 68 of 1984.

In Civil Appeal No.  2749/1982, cases of 12 workmen  and  in  Civil Appeal No.  2750/1982  cases  of  14 workmen  have  been  referred  to  the  Industrial  Tribunal (hereinafter  referred to the Tribunal), on dispute  being raised  on  the  question as to whether the  action  of  the management  of  the  Oriental  Fire  and  General  Insurance Company  Ltd.,  Madras  in not re-categorising  the  workmen mentioned in the course of reference is justified ?  If not, to  what  reliefs the concerned workmen are entitled  ?   In Civil  Appeal  No.   2751/1982   question  referred  to  the Tribunal  is slightly different, that is, whether the action of  the  management  in  re-categorising  Shri  C.R.   Mane, Assistant,  as Record-keeper is justified ?  If not, to what relief the concerned workman is entitled and from which date ? In all these cases the Presiding Officer of the Tribunal to  whom  the reference was made gave an award stating  that the scheme has been framed for rationalising or revising the pay-scales  and other terms and conditions of service of the officers  and  other  employees  in  the  General  Insurance Company  which  has been published by a notification  issued under  Section  16(6)  of the Central Act 57  of  1972  and, therefore,  if the employees or the management feel that the existing provisions in the scheme relating to categorisation are  arbitrary or in practice work hardship to the employees it  is for the Union to take up this issue and pursuade  the Central  Government  which  will be entitled  under  Section 16(6), by notification, to modify the same and by no stretch of imagination the Tribunal constituted under the Industrial Disputes  Act  can  declare  the action  of  the  management unjustified  and reject the scheme.  In case of C.R.   Mane, the  Tribunal noticed that if the concerned workman had  any grievance  he  ought to have made an appeal to the Board  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Company to which he belonged and such representation had been  made to the Review Committee and the Review  Committee gave  its finding and, therefore, the Tribunal took the view that  the finding of the Review Committee that the concerned workman  was properly categorised as Record Clerk appears to be  justified  and calls for no interference and it  had  no jurisdiction to go into the merits of the case. The scope of categorisation under different schemes will be  with reference to different classes of workmen.  Whether any particular workman has to be categorised in one category or another or categorisation of such workman in one group or another  or non-categorisation of such workman in one  group or  another  gives rise to a dispute for reference and  that was  exactly the dispute before the Tribunal.  That  dispute has  to be resolved with reference to the principles  stated in  the  scheme and apply the scheme with reference to  each one  of the workmen and find out whether the  categorisation of  that  workman is correct or not.  That exercise has  not been  done  by  the Tribunal, but it has simply gone  on  to proceed that placing of one or other workman in one category or  another  is itself a part of the scheme and,  therefore, the  Tribunal  cannot  examine the same.  This  approach  of Tribunal  is not justified at all.  Therefore, we set  aside the  awards  in each of these cases and remit the matter  to the  Tribunal for fresh consideration in accordance with law and in the light of this order. The   appeals  are  allowed   accordingly  with   costs. Advocates  fee  is  fixed at Rs.  2500/- in each  of  these three cases.","Three appeals have been presented by special leave by the General Secretary of the General Insurance Employees Union, Madras.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 489 of 1979. From the  Judgment and  Order dated  9-11-1978  of  the Kerala High Court in Crl. R.P. No. 260/77. K. T.  Harendra Nath  and T.  T.  Kunhikannan  for  the Petitioner. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER,  J.-The Petitioner  has pressed before us certain points  of law  which have not been urged before the High Court and so we are unable to examine the tenability of those points. For this reason, petition must be dismissed. Counsel drew  our attention  to the  fact that although the episode,  which is the subject matter of the prosecution under section 16 (1A) (i) read with section 7(i) and section 2(1A) of the prevention of Food Adulteration Act, took place allegedly in  1972. There was inexplicable, inordinate delay in trial.  The case  was tried  in 1977  which, according to counsel, prejudiced  the  petitioner  considerably.  We  are aghast at the traumatic impact on criminal justice inflicted by delayed  trials when human memory becomes faded and vivid testimony is  withheld. The  present case  is an instance in point. We feel strongly that the trial courts in the country should ensure  that, in  the spirit  of Article  21  of  the Constitution, food adulteration cases, 5 which involve  imprisonment, are tried expeditiously so that neither the  prosecution nor  the accused  is prejudiced  by unusual procrastination.  We express  the hope that the High http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court concerned  will issue  peremptory directions  to trial Judges demanding  expeditious disposal of such cases. In the present case,  prosecution evidence,  as regards  taking  of samples, is  perhaps not  as good  as it would have been had the trial  been prompt.  We do  not want forensic martyrdoms for prosecutions  in  food  adulteration  cases,  thanks  to tarred trials  blamable on  the judicial  process. The State Government has  a duty  to sanction  the required  courts in obedience  to  the  mandate  of  Article  21  which  implies judicial justice without undue delay. Maybe, there  is some grievance for the petitioner that he was  disabled in  defending himself properly, hampered by the lapse of five years, but unfortunately the point was not pressed before  the High  Court; and,  we do  not  think  it proper to investigate the substantiality of the prejudice. As for the sentence, true that, in this case, it is not shown that  the petitioner is a big merchant. Perhaps he was a petty  dealer and  counsel represents  that the  trade has been wound  up. It is also submitted that the petitioner has served  about   three  months  out  of  the  six  months  of imprisonment.   Having    regard   to    the   totality   of circumstances, it  is open  to the  petitioner to  move  the State Government  to remit  the  remaining  portion  of  the sentence, if  so advised, and it would be for the Government to consider  at all  whether it should exercise its power of remission and its impact on society.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. Since this is a long drawn litigation for over 37 years we think  it appropriate to give quick end to the litigation instead of  remanding the  matter  to  the  High  Court  for further remanding  it to  the appellate  Court. It is not in dispute  that   Machine  Chowdegowda,   the  father  of  the appellant had  three brothers. The suit came to be filed for partition of  10 acres  of wet land, 5.30 acres of dry land, 30 gunthas  of house  site into  four equal  parts and 1/8th share towards  the appellant-plaintiff. At three stages, the suit came  to be  dismissed and  ultimately  in  the  second appeal No.204/94,  by judgment  and decree  dated March  17, 1995 the  High Court of Karnataka confirmed the dismissal of the suit. Thus this appeal by special leave. There is  evidence in  this case Exs. P-1, P-4 and P-36 which would  indicate that Machine Chowdegowda had described the appellant  to  be  the  son  born  to  his  first  wife, Siddamma. It  is seen that there is a controversy as regards the factum  of  the  customary  marriage  by  name  Kuduvali marriage which  seems to  have taken  place in  early  1920. Under those  circumstances, at  the distance  of 40 years it would be  difficult to  prove with  certainly of evidence of the factum  of the marriage etc. But the meat of the fact is that Siddamma and Machine Chowdegowda lived together as wife and husband  and the appellant came to be born from the wed- lock. Under  those circumstances,  the presumption  of valid marriage and  as to  appellant having been born legitimately out of  the that  marriage through Machine Chowdegowda could be drawn.  This is  the legal position settled by this Court In Badri  Prasad v. Deputy Director of Consolidation [(1978) 3 SCC  527], Sumitra  Devi v. Bhikan Choudhary [(1985) 1 SCC 637] and  S.P.S. Balasubramanyan v. Suruttayan [(1994) 1 SCc 460]. The  appellant must,  therefore, be  presumed to  be a legitimate son  of  machine  Chowdegowda.  Accordingly,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellant is  granted one  acre of the wet land and the rest of the  land will  be given to the respondents according tot he respective  shares. A  preliminary decree be drawn and an application to  pass final  decree be made and dealt with by the trial Court. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","The suit came to be filed for partition of 10 acres of wet land, 5.30 acres of dry land, 30 gunthas of house site into four equal parts and 1/8th share towards the appellant-plaintiff.

On verification, it  was found  that his  atecedents were  such that his  appointment to the post of Constable was not found desirable. Accordingly,  his name was rejected. Aggrieved by proceedings  dated   December  18,   1990   culminating   in cancellation of his provisional selection he filed OA in the Central  Administrative   Tribunal.  The   Tribunal  in  the impugned order  allowed the  application on  the ground that since the respondent had been discharged and/or acquitted of the offence  punishable under Section 304 IPC, under Section 324 read with 34 IPC and under Section 394 IPC, he cannot be denied the right of appointment to the post under the State.  The question is: whether the view taken by the Tribunal is correct in law? It is seen that verification of the  character and  antecedents is  one of  the important criteria to  test whether the selected candidate is suitable to a  post under  the State.  Though he was physically found fit,  Passed   the  written   test  and  interview  and  was provisionally selected, on account of his antecedent record, the appointing authority found it not desirable to appoint a person of  such record  as a  Constable to  the  disciplined forces The  view taken  by the  appointing authority  in the background of the case cannot be said to be unwarranted. The Tribunal, therefore,  was wholly  unjustified in  giving the direction for  reconsideration of  his case.  Though he  was discharged or  acquitted of  the criminal offences, the same has nothing  to do with the question. What would be relevant is the conduct or character of the candidate to be appointed to a  service and  not the  actual result  thereof.  If  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 actual result  happened to  be in  a particular way, the law will  take  care  of  the  consequences.  The  consideration relevant to the case is of the antecedents of the candidate. Appointing authority,  therefore, has  rightly focussed this aspect and  found him  not desirable  to appoint  him to the service. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the Tribunal stands set aside. No costs.","This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Central  Administrative  Tribunal,  New  Delhi.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard counsel on both sides. It is  not in dispute that in of No.22/62 filed against five persons,  there was  a compromise by the appellant. The appellant was  impleaded as  first  defendant.  Pursuant  to compromise memo  dated June  7, 1972  filed under  Order 23, Rule 3  CPC, the Court passed a decree in terms thereof. The clauses contained  in the memo were that the appellant shall continue to be in occupation as Manager of the trust for its administration and  the  deities  installed  in  the  plaint schedule property.  The two  shops built by the appellant in the shrine  were declared  to be  continued  to  be  in  his possession subject to his performing the worship in the same way as was done by his ancestors. The money deposited by him in OS  No.463/64 on  the file  of  Second  Additional  Civil Judge, Bangalore  City was  agreed to be refunded to him and half the  institution  fee  was  also  to  be  refunded.  In furtherance thereof,  the appeal  was remanded  to the trial Court for  consideration of  the matter  afresh  as  against defendants 2  to 4. In furtherance thereof, the suit came to be  dismissed.   Again,  a  compromise  memo  was  filed  by defendants 2  to 4  in the  High Court and the fish Court in the impugned  order dated  January  25,  1993  made  in  RFA No.176/80 recorded the compromise as against defendants 2 to 4 and  disposed of  the matter  in terms  thereof. Thus this appeal by special leave. Firstly, there  is a  difficulty  in  the  way  of  the appellant  for   the  reason   that  respondent  1(iii)  and respondent 2  died and  though steps  were  directed  to  be taken, no  steps have  been taken  as against them. It would appear that  counsel for  the petitioner  made an  affidavit proposing to  delete respondent 1(iii) and respondent 2 from the array  of the parties. Even if we accept that stand, the problem will  be whether  the decree  as compromised against http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 defendants 2  to  4  could  be  set  aside  as  against  the appellant. It  is  seen  that  in  the  first  instance  the appellant had  specifically compromised  the matter in terms of the  compromise memo  which was recorded against him. The litigation thereby  came to  an end.  When  the  matter  was remitted to  the trial  Court,  it  was  confined  vis-a-vis defendants 2  to 4.  After the  disposal of  the suit by the trial Court,  pending appeal,  they came  to compromise with the respondent  and in terms thereof, thee compromise decree came to  be recorded  in which the appellant cannot have any grievance in  the matter  as  against  him.  The  compromise decree referred  to in  the first instance would operate and he is  bound thereby.  The appeal,  therefore, does not have any merit. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs. We have heard counsel on both sides.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Central  Administrative Tribunal,  Principal  Bench  New Delhi made on May 30, 1986 in O.A. No.173/1986. The  admitted  position  is  that  appellant  No.1  was appointed as  a Junior  Scientific Assistant, Grade II on 30 67. He  was made  permanent on April 1, 1970 and was further promoted as  Senior Scientific  Assistant  on  1.10.1973  in Defence Research  and   Development Organisation.  Similarly the second  appellant was  appointed  as  Junior  Scientific Assistant, Grade  I on  6.6.1967 and  was made  permanent on April  1,   1970.  He  was  promoted  as  Junior  Scientific Assistant, Grade  I on  25.3.19?1. All  have held while they were  continuing   in   Defence   Research   &   Development Organisation (DRDO).  Subsequently, in  1976, the  Technical Committee (Engineer  Stores) was  constituted   and  it  was transferred so as to be under the charge of Director General of Inspection.  They were transferred within that Department and continued to be in the said Department. With effect from January 30,  1979, the Department was further trifurcated as Director  General  of  Inspection  and  Technical  Committee (Engineers Stores).  It would  appeal that  the  chances  of promotions accelerated  in DRDO.  The appellants, therefore, claimed repatriation  to the  DRDO from  Director General of Inspection. Since the respondents’ requests were not acceded to, they  filed O.A. in the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the O.A. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It is  contended for  the appellants that by fortuitous circumstances, they have been posted in the Director General Inspection  and   in  the   Technical  Committee  (Engineers Stores). Since  common seniority was maintained prior to the trifurcation, they  had no  grievance for  their continuance under the  control of Director General of Inspection, At the time of  trifurcation,  though  the  Department  called  for option from Grade-I but to Grade-II Officers, no such option was given,  The appellants  said that this was against their wishes. They  cannot be  made to suffer the continuance in a transferee Department  and, therefore,  they are entitled to all the  benefits of promotions. When a person junior to him in DRDO  was confirmed  and promoted  to a  higher post, the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellants claimed parity. Having regard to the contentions, the question  that arises  for consideration is: whether the non transfer  of the  appellants to  the DRDO is vitiated by any manifest  error warranting interference? It is seen that initially DRDO  and DGI  were two  separate  operations.  In respect of  the service  in Technical  Committee,  personnel were discharging  the respective duties assigned to them and the personnel therein were transferred to the administrative control of  the Director  General of  Inspection. The entire wing having been transferred, to be in the control of the Director General  of Inspection, necessary consequence would be that  the personnel  working there  would remain  in  the Department. It  is not  the case  of  the  transfer  of  the employees from one Department to other Departments on option basis. Under  these circumstances,  though the  persons have been appointed subsequent to them while they remained within the charge  of  DRDO  Department,  they  cannot  claim  that injustice has  been done to them. Under these circumstances, we think  that there is no illegality in the order passed by the Tribunal warranting interference. The appeal  is accordingly  dismissed. If there are any rights given  to them  and the  personnel similarly situated have given  accelerated, that  would be a different cause of action. The  appellants would  be free to avail of remedy as is available under the law.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal,  Principal Bench  New Delhi made on May 30, 1986 in O.A.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R REPORTABLE CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3939-3941 OF 2002 WITH C.A. NO.3983/2004 These appeals have been preferred by the State against the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court.  By the impugned order, the High Court directed that the respondents be paid the pensionary benefits from the respective date of their retirement under the provisions of Pension Rules 1980. We have heard the parties at length. Briefly stated the facts are as follows. The respondents were Lecturers in private aided college.  The age of superannuation of the respondents was 60 years.  By an amendment of the Education Code in 1993, the age of superannuation of the respondents  has been brought down to ......2. - 2 - 58 years.  In the said amendment it was also provided that the respondents shall be entitled to pension with effect from 1st November 1992. Aggrieved thereby, the respondents preferred writ petition before the High Court. The Division Bench of the High Court, after hearing the parties, was of the view that the cut off date 1/11/1992 fixed by the Government was arbitrary and discriminatory. In a catena of decisions of this Court it has been held that the cut off date is fix ed by the executive authority keeping in view the economic conditions, financial constraints and many other administrative and other attending circumstances.  This Court is also of the view that fixing cut off dates is within the domain of the executive authority and the Court should not normally interfere with the fixation of cut off date by the executive authority unless such order appears to be on the face of it blatantly discriminatory and arbitrary. (See State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Amar Nath Goyal & Ors., (2005) 6 SCC 754). No doubt in D.S. Nakara & Ors.  vs.  Union of India 1983(1) SCC 305 this Court had struck down the cut off date in ......3. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 - 3 - connection with the demand of pension.  However, in subsequent decisions this Court has considerably watered down the rigid view taken in Nakara’s Case (supra), as observed in para 29 of the decision of this Court in State of Punjab & Ors.  vs.  Amar Nath Goyal & Ors. (supra). There may be various considerations in the mind of the executive authorities due to which a particular cut off date has been fixed.  These considerations can be financial, administrative or other considerations.  The Court must exercise judicial restraint and must ordinarily leave it to the executive authorities to fix the cut off date.  The Government must be left with some leeway and free play at the joints in this connection. In fact several decisions of this Court have gone to the extent of saying that the c hoice of a cut off date cannot be dubbed as arbitrary even if no particular reason is given for the same in the counter affidavit filed by the Government, (unless it is shown to be totally capricious or whimsical) vide State of Bihar  vs.  Ramjee Prasad 1990(3) SCC 368, Union of Indian & Anr.  vs.  Sudhir Kumar Jaiswal  1994(4) SCC 212 (vide para 5), Ramrao & Ors.  vs.  All India Backward Class Bank Employees  Welfare Association  &  Ors.  2004 (2) SCC 76 .....4. - 4 - (vide para 31), University Grants Commission  vs.  Sadhana Chaudhary & Ors. 1996(10) SCC 536, etc.  It follows, therefore, that even if no reason has been given in the counter affidavit of the Government or the executive authority as to why a particular cut off date has been chosen, the Court must still not declare that date to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14 unless the said cut off date leads to some blatantly capricious or outrageous result. As has been held by this Court in Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club & Anr.  vs. Chander Hass & Anr. 2008(3) 3 JT 221 and in Government of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. vs.  Smt. P. Laxmi Devi  2008(2) 8 JT 639 the Court must maintain judicial restraint in matters relating to the legislative or executive domain. For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside.  Th e appeals are allowed.",The respondents were Lecturers in private aided college. The age of superannuation of the respondents was 60 years. The cut off date 1/11/1992 fixed by the Government was arbitrary and discriminatory.

" J U D G M E N T MARKANDEY KATJU, J. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment & order of the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 115 of 1996. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. In this case the appellant Bandu had been found guilty under Section 498-A of the India Penal Code and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 2 years and a fine of Rs. 500/- by the trial court.   However, on appeal by the State Government as well as Bandu, the High Court while setting aside the conviction of the appellant under Section 498A, held him guilty under Section 302 IPC and convicted him to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500/-. According to the prosecution case PW6 Shanta Kotangale was married to accused Bandu on 10.5.1985.  After happy cohabitation for initial 12 months, the parties started having differences.  Accused Bandu used to say that he did not like Shanta and that she should go back to her parent’s place.  She conceived, but continued to face ill-treatment.  Eventually, her brother took her to the parental house.  She filed a petition for maintenance before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class Hinganghat, in which a compromise was reached on 2.10.1990, and the parties resumed cohabitation.  Thereafter she gave a birth to a daughter, named Nita, at her parent’s place.  Accused Bandu brought back his wife and daughter to his matrimonial home.  For a few days everything was all right, but thereafter the accused started saying that Nita was not his daughter and, therefore, he prevented Shanta from feeding Nita.  On 1.1.1991 at about 3 A.M., when Shanta and accused Bandu were sleeping with their daughter, the accused killed daughter Nita by pressing her neck and threw Nita from the cot. Shanta  started crying which attracted quite a crowd and Pulgaon Police Station was informed about the incident.  The police came to the spot, took the dead body of 1-1/2 year old Nita and sent it for post mortem examination. After the inquest, the police performed panchanama on the spot, examined the witnesses and registered the offence.  The accused was arrested on completion of the investigation and charge-sheet was sent to the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Pulgaon.  The learned Magistrate committed the case to the Court of Sessions at Wardha. On perusal of the facts, it appears that wife Shanta has deposed that the appellant killed his daughter Nita, who was only 1-1/2 years old, by strangling her.   It has come in evidence that the appellant suspected the fidelity of his wife Shanta and thought that Nita was not his child at all.  There had been differences between the husband and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 wife as a result of which she was made to leave her husband’s house, but Shanta returned to the appellant after giving birth to her daughter Nita.  The accused-appellant  did not allow her to feed her daughter Nita and ultimately on 1.1.1991 killed her by strangling her.  We see no reason to disbelieve Shanta. We have seen the post mortem report.  There are injuries on the neck, cheek and eyes of the child Nita and the doctor has given her evidence that the probable cause of death might be due to asphyxia due to suffocation.   We see no reason to disbelieve the prosecution case as it is consistent with the medical evidence. We have carefully gone through the evidence of Shanta.   She is an eye witness to the incident and thus there is direct evidence in this case.  She has stated that her husband was not allowing her to give milk and feed to her child, Nita and her husband killed the child by pressing her neck.  Her evidence is credible and also stood corroborated by the post mortem report and other evidence on record. Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.","Shanta Kotangale was married to accused Bandu on 10.5.1985.

" Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.B.Pattanaik Nemo for the appellants. S.K. Agnihotri, Adv. for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Though the  legal representatives of the appellant have been brought on record, they did not appear either in person or through  counsel. We  have taken  the assistance  of Shri S.K. Agnihotri, learned counsel for the State. The appellant,  while  working  as  Sub-Inspector,  and being in-charge  of the  Police Station  Pakhanjur, District Jagadalpur, on  receipt of  illegal gratification  failed to prevent  the   running  of  common  gambling  house  of  one N.K.Ghosh.  Consequently,   in  the   departmental   enquiry initiated  against  him,  the  Enquiry  Officer,  after  due enquiry and giving him opportunity, found that the appellant had received  illegal gratification  form the  organiser  of gambling, N.K.Ghosh.  Thereby, misconduct was proved against him, Based  thereon, he  was dismissed from service by order dated July  31,1971. On  appeal, it  was  confirmed  by  the Inspector General  of Police by order dated January 21,1974. The  same   came  to  be  challenged  in  the  Misc.Petition No.204/74. The  Division Bench  of the  High  Court  in  the impugned judgment  dated May  2,1978,  dismissed  the  same. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Two grounds  have been pressed for consideration in the High Court and reiterated in the appeal. The main ground was that the report of the preliminary enquiry conducted against him before initiating departmental enquiry, was not supplied to him  and, therefore,  it is violative of the principle of natural justice.  The High Court has rejected the contention an, in  our view  quite, rightly.  The preliminary report is only to  decide and  assess whether it would be necessary to take any  disciplinary action against the delinquent officer and it does not form any foundation for passing the order of dismissal against the employee. The High Court also found as a fact  that at  the statements of persons that formed basis for report,  recorded during  the preliminary  enquiry  were http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 supplied to  the delinquent  officer. It  was then contended that one  of the  constables, namely,  Palairam  was  a  co- accused who was also charge along with the appellant and his evidence was  taken into  consideration in  deciding against the appellant  which  is  inadmissible  in  evidence.  In  a departmental enquiry,  the  question,  whether  or  not  any delinquent officer  is co-accused with other does not arise. That would arise in a prosecution laid for officer under the IPC or  Prevention of  Corruption Act. The evidence recorded in the departmental enquiry stricto senso is not evidence as per the  provisions of  the  Evidence  Act.  Therefore,  the statement of  Palairam also  formed part of the record which could be  taken into  account in  adjudging  the  misconduct against the  appellant. The  Inspector General of Police had stated  that   even  if  that  evidence  was  excluded  form consideration, there  was other  sufficient evidence to come to the  conclusion that  the  appellant  had  taken  illegal gratification for  the organiser of gambling, Thus, the High Court has  not committed  any error of law in dismissing the writ petition of the appellant. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The appellant,  while working  as  Sub-Inspector,  and being in-charge  of the  Police Station  Pakhanjur, District Jagadalpur, on  receipt of  illegal gratification  failed to prevent  the  running  of  common gambling house of one N.K.Ghosh.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the M.P.  High Court  passed  on  July  14,  1986  in  Civil Miscellaneous Petition  No.3382/85. The  facts are  that the respondent while  working as  Agriculture  Engineer  in  the Directorate of  Agriculture is  alleged  to  have  committed misconduct. Consequently,  after his retirement on attaining the age of superannuation on July 31, 1982, proceedings were sought to  be initiated  against him and notice therefor was issued on July 28, 1984. He filed a writ petition on October 14,  1985  calling  in  question  the  jurisdiction  of  the Government to  initiate proceedings.  The High  Court in the impugned order  held that  the Governor  has  to  personally satisfy himself of the necessity to initiate proceedings and since the  Governor has not passed the order, the Government cannot  go   into  the  question  and  conduct  disciplinary proceedings against the respondent. Hence, the writ petition was allowed. The controversy  is no  longer res  integra as  in C.A. No.11536/95 State  of M.P.  & Ors. vs. Dr. Yashwant Trimbak, to which  one of  us Pattanaik,  J. was a member, this Court elaborately had considered the controversy and had held that the Governor  need not  act on  personal satisfaction. Under Article 166(3)  of the  Constitution, the  Governor has made Business rule  for convenient transaction of the business of the Government  and the question of sanction to prosecute in the case  is dealt  with by  the  Council  of  Ministers  in accordance with the Rules of Business. It is  settled law  that  the  Governor  exercises  the executive power of the Government with the aid and advice of the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  executive  power  of  the Government is  carried on  by Article 162 in accordance with the Rules  of Business  made by  the Governor  under Article 166(3).  The   Business  Rules   and   Instructions   issued http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 thereunder allocate  various subjects  to the  Ministers and cases be appropriately dealt with at different levels of the Government. All the decisions need not be circulated nor the Governor is  saddled with  matters of administrative routine except where  the Constitution  enjoins him  to exercise his personal  discretion.   Since  the   action  was   initiated according to  the Business  Rules the  competent  authority, therefore, is  within its  power to proceed with the enquiry as contemplated  under the  Pension Rules. The enquiry would be conducted according to Rules as expeditiously as possible and orders  would be  passed soon thereafter. It may be done within one year from the date of receipt of the order.

" O R D E R The Union  Public Service  Commission (for  short  ’the Commission’)   issued  and  advertisement  dated  10.10.1987 inviting  applications   for  three   posts   of   Assistant Professors of Medicine. The essential qualifications for the post  were   set  out  in  the  application  .  One  of  the qualifications  was:   at  least   three   years’   teaching experience   in    the    concerned    speciality    as    a lecturer/Tutor/Demonstrator/Senior Resident/Registrar  after obtaining the  requisite post-graduate degree qualification. Note 21  to the  advertisement states  that  the  prescribed essential qualifications were the minimum qualifications and a were  possession of minimum qualification does not entitle the candidates  to be called for interview. where the number of applications  received in response to an advertisement is large and  it will  not be  convenient or  possible for  the commission to  interview all  the candidates, the commission may restrict  the number of candidates to a reasonable limit on the  basis of  qualifications and  experience higher than the minimum  prescribed in the advertisement or by holding a screening test. In the  present case  37 applications were received for the three  posts. The  Commission thereupon  shortlisted the candidates to  be called  for interview  on the  basis of  4 years’ experience  or more.  As a result, 20 candidates were called for  interview. Respondent  No.1 did  not qualify for shortlisting and hence he was not called for interview. He along  with one  Dr. V.S.  Gopalakrishnan  filed  an application  before  the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal, Madras bench(hereinafter referred to as ’the Tribunal’ ) for setting  aside  the  selection  to  the  post  of  Assistant Professor of  Medicine Pursuant to the said advertisement by challenging  shortlisting.   The  Tribunal   held  that  the Commission had not filed a separate reply. Taking note of an averment made  by the  applicants before the Tribunal that a large number  of vacancies  were available,  it remitted the case to  the Commission  for re-processing  all applications including those  of  the  applicants  for  fresh  selection, disapproving of the shortlisting done by the commission. The Tribunal  has clearly erred in doing so. Note 21 to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the advertisement  expressly provides that if a large number of applications  are received  the commission  may shortlist candidates  for   interview   on   the   basis   of   higher qualifications  although  all  applicants  may  possess  the requisite minimum qualifications. In the case of M.P. Public Service Commission  vs. Navnit Kumar Potdar & Anr. JT (1994) 6 SC   302  this court has upheld shortlisting of candidates on some rational and reasonable basis. In that case, for the purpose of  shortlisting, a longer period of experience than the minimum prescribed was used as a criterion by the public service Commission  for calling candidates for an interview. This was  upheld by this Court. In the case of Govt. of A.P. vs. P. Dilip Kumar & Anr. JT (1993) 2 SC 138 also this court said that  it is  always open  to the  recruiting agency  to screen candidates  due for consideration at the threshold of the process  of selection  by prescribing higher eligibility qualification so that the field of selection can be narrowed down with  the ultimate  objective of  promoting  candidates with  higher   qualifications   to   enter   the   zone   of consideration. The  procedure,  therefore,  adopted  in  the present case  by the commission was legitimate. The decision of the  Tribunal is,  therefore, set aside and the appeal is allowed. There will, however, be no order as to costs.","Public Service Commission issued advertisement inviting applications for three posts of Assistant Professors of Medicine. 37 applications were received for the three posts.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) No.6346 of 2006) We have heard learned counsels for the parties. Leave granted. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 19th December, 2005 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Civil Writ Petition No.19680 of 2005 whereby the Division Bench has upheld the Award passed by the Labour Court and found that the respondent has been wrongly terminated in violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  The Labour Court has granted reinstatement with full backwages by the Order dated 16th September, 2005. Aggrieved against this, the appellant challenged the same before the High Court and the High Court affirmed the order of the Tribunal.  Hence the present appeal. A notice was issued by this Court on 17th April, 2006 confined to the question of payment of full back ...2/- -2- wages.  Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondent is not entitled to full back wages as he has to plead and prove that he was not gainfully employed.  There is no such averment made by the workmen either before the Labour Court or in any proceedings that he was not gainfully employed. Learned counsel for the appellant has invited our  attention to the decision of this Court titled Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and another versus S.C.Sharma reported in 2005 (2) SCC 363 wherein this Court has held that the initial burden is on the employee, he has to show that he was not gainfully employed.  It is thereafter that the employer can bring on record the material to rebut the claim of the employee. In that case also the employee has neither  pleaded nor placed on record any material in that regard.  Therefore, this Court has held that the incumbent is not entitled to full back wages. Similarly in present case also there is no such averment made by workman. Learned counsel for respondent invited our attention to the decision of this Court titled U.P. SRTC Ltd. versus Sarada Prasad Misra and another reported in 2006 (4) SCC 733 in which this Court has observed that what should be the backwages depends upon case to case and no hard and fast rule can be laid down. In this case, ...3/- -3- this Court has observed that the incumbent is entitled to 50% of the back wages from the date of the Award till the date of reinstatement. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the ends of justice would be met by giving the respondent 50% of the back wages from the date of the termination till the date of the Award. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Learned counsel for the respondent submits that the incumbent has not been reinstated despite his appearing before the authorities.  For that relief, he can approach the appropriate forum.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned single  of the Allahabad High Court, made on August 10,  1984 dismissing  Writ petition  No.2589/82.  The admitted  position   is  Ram   Het  had  filed  a  suit  for declaration under  Section 6  of the  Urban Land  (Ceiling & Regulation) Act,  1976. The competent authority prepared the draft statement  and issued the notice and after hearing the objections observed  that the declarant was in possession of 1146.0430  sq.  mts.  of  land  in  excess  of  the  ceiling prescribed. Thereon, an appeal was filed before the District Judge. Pending  disposal of  the appeal, the declarent died. The  District   Judge  remitted   the   matter   for   fresh consideration  to   the  competent   authority.  Again   the competent authority  by its  order  dated  August  17,  1981 determined the  excess vacant  land as 1146.0430 sq.mts. The respondents again  filed an appeal before the District Judge who Judge  remitted the  matter to  the competent authority. Against the remand order, the Government filed writ petition which was dismissed. Thus, this appeal. it is contended that the only  question that  requires to  be decided is: whether the legal  representatives can  claim proportionate  shares, after the  demise of the declarant? The High Court has given a  finding   that  the   appropriate  date,   on  which  the entitlement has  to be  considered, is  date  on  which  the declaration under  Section 6  was filed and on that date Ram Het was  the owner and filed the declaration in his capacity as  holder   of  the   vacant  urban   land.   Under   these circmstances,  after   the  demise  of  the  declarant,  the question would  be: whether the lagal representatives of the holder of the urban vacant land could claim any deduction on the basic of their intestate of testamentary succession? The crucial date  is the  sate of  the declaration  filed  under Section  6(1)  before  the  competent  authority.  When  the declaration under  Section 6(1)  was filed,  Ram Het was the holder of the urban vacant land and he accordingly filed the declaration. After  the demise, the question of intestate or the testamentary  succession does  not arise.  The  District Judge, therefore,  was not  right is  remanding  the  matter again for  fresh consideration  and computation;  Thus,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 High Court  is not  correct  in  not  interfering  with  the appellate order  though it  found  that  it  made  a  little difference. Under these  circumstances, the  appeal is allowed. The order of  the High  Court stands  set  aside  and  the  writ petition is  allowed. The  order of  the appellate authority stands quashed  and that  of the  competent authority stands upheld.

Since the appellant had not disclosed the material facts of the manufacture of excis able goods in any manner to the Department with an intent to evade central excise duty, a show cause notice dated 24.4.1998 was issued to the appellant.  After the reply having been filed by the appellant, the Additional Commissioner vide Order in Original No.81/98 dated 24th December 1998 confirmed the demand of central excise duty; imposed penalty besides confiscating the seized goods and ordered redemption of goods on payment of redemption fine of Rs.35,000/- in lieu of confiscation.  The Addl. Commissioner also imposed a penalty of Rs.15,000/- on Sh. Sudhir Kumar, Director of the appellant-company.   The  appellant, being  aggrieved, filed an C.A.No.4549/02 .... (Contd.) - 2 - appeal before the  Commissioner (Appeals) which was rejected vide order dated 12th February 2001. The appellant thereafter filed an appeal before the Tribunal on the grounds, inter a lia, that the activities carried on by the appellant did not amount to manufacture; that the products remained nuts and are not known by any other name in the trade parlance and, therefore, it cannot be held that they were subjected to any preparation which may bring them into the mischief of duty of excise.  The Tribunal negatived the plea raised by the appellant and confirmed the order in original but reduced the amount of penalty. Being dissatisfied by the order of the Tribunal, the appellant has filed the present appeal. This Court entertained the appeal and issued notice only insofar as peanuts, pista, cashewnuts and almonds are concerned.  The appeal was not entertained as regards other items.  This appeal was ordered to be tagged with other connected appeals.  Thus, the appeal was listed along with C.A.No.2215 of 2002 and other appeals involving similar question.  However, since the counsel for the appellant was not present on the date of hearing, the present appeal was de-linked and the connected appeals were disposed of by a judgment dated 07th February 2008 in the case of Commissioner of Customs & Central Excise, Goa v. Phil Corporation Ltd. reported in 2008(2) SCALE 260 = JT 2008(2) SC 239.  By  the  said  judgment,  C.A.No.2215 of 2002 filed by the C.A.No.4549/02 ....

In C.A.No.2215 of 2002, the Tribunal had taken a contrary view than the one taken by the Tribunal in the present case.  In that case it was held by the Tribunal that the similar activities carried on by the assessee did not amount to manufacture.  Hence, the products in question were not chargeable to duty.  This Court, by the aforementioned judgment, has reversed the order of the Tribunal and has held that the activities carried on by the assess ee amounted to ’manufacture’ and that the products in question were classifiable under Chapter 20 of the Central Excise Tariff Act and accordingly set aside the order passed by the Tribunal and allowed the appeal filed by the Revenue.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the order of the High  Court of  Patna, made  in Appeal from the Original Order No.406/86 on July 24, 1996. The  respondent   had  filed   a  suit   for   specific performance on the foot of an agreement alleged to have been executed by the petitioner. The petitioner was served notice but since  she did not contest the suit, ex-parte decree was granted. Subsequently,  the petitioner  filed an application under Order IX, Rule 13, C.P.C. seeking setting aside of the ex-parte decree. Therein, her specific case was that she was not residing  at Garhia  Village and,  therefore, the notice could not  be  deemed  to  have  been  served  on  her.  The endorsement is  not correct.  The question  was gone into by the courts below after recording the evidence of one Laxuman Yadav, Mahendra  Yadav and  process server. It is their case that on  January 15,  1985 when the summons were handed over to Mst.  Bhabia Devi  and when  she was  acquainted with the facts, she  refused to  sign or  put thumb impression on the notice. When  the process server had gone to serve it on her personally on April 2, 1984 to the village and also on April 9, 1984  when the  registered card acknowledgement was sent, she refused to acknowledge it. Under those circumstance, the courts below  have concluded and the High Court has recorded as under: ""Apart from  the aforementioned two modes for  service of  notice, as I have already noticed, there was yet anther  mode   by  way  of  Gazette publication. An  attempt  has  been made on  behalf of the appellant to say that  she being illiterate lady could not  learn about  the Gazette publication."" This is  a finding  of  fact  on  appreciation  of  the evidence. Thereby,  it is  clear that petitioner had refused to accept  the notice. Consequently, she was rightly set ex- parte.

" JUDGMENT 2002 (2) SCR 380 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAJENDRA BABU, J. C.A.No. 3221 of 2000 The respondent brought a suit on the basis of certain instructions issued by the appellant-Board for absorption of daily-wage workers to work-charged establishment who had completed 500 days of service. While the Trial Court did not nave the benefit of the circular, the appellate court did have the benefit of that circular dated 19.9.1991. The Trial Court, however, decreed the suit. In the appeal, the appellate court noticed that the respondent in each of these cases had completed 500 days as daily-wage worker by the cut-off date, which had been extended from time to time. Thus it was found that the respondent in each of the cases was entitled to be absorbed as work-charged worker. But the appellant-Board had not considered his case while passing the order impugned in the suit and, therefore, he was entitled to be absorbed as work-charged worker by conversion from daily wage worker to the work-charged establishment. The matter was carried in second appeal to the High Court. The principal contention put forth before the High Court is that not only the daily wage worker should have 500 days of service by the cut-off date but also must continue to be in the service of the Board on the date of issuance of the circular. The High Court, however, found that mere was no stipulation that such a daily wage worker should be actually in service on the date of issuance of the circular and on that basis dismissed the second appeal. Hence, this appeal by special leave. The relevant portion of the circular dated 19.9.1991 reads as follows: ""The matter regarding conversion of daily wage workers into work-charge has been reviewed by the Board and it has been decided that all daily wage workers who have put in 500 working days in the service of the Board upto thirteenth September eighty eight [30.9.88] and are continuing in service of Board shall be eligible to be converted into work-charge workers. These conversions will be subject to availability of work charge posts and no further appointments will be made on daily wage basis."" The High Court read the circular only upto the cut-off date and not thereafter. The latter part, which clearly states ""and are continuing in service of Board"" in order to become eligible to be converted into work charged employees was lost sight of by the High Court. Therefore, it was held that the sole condition to be fulfilled was that the daily wage worker should have put in 500 working days upto the cut-off date. That interpretation will not be correct in the circumstances of the case, when two conditions had been imposed; firstly that the concerned daily wage http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 worker should not only put in 500 working days in service upto the cut-off date, and secondly, should be in continuous service upto the date of issuance of the circular in order to become eligible to be converted into work charged employees. The second aspect could not have been ignored at all. The appeal is, therefore, allowed, the order made by the High Court is set aside and the matter shall stand remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration on this aspect of the matter with reference to facts arising in the case.

The  incriminating material recovered  from the  from house would indicate that he was  making payments  to certain  persons and  one of the names disclosed  from the  incriminating material was of the respondent. Consequently,  a charge memo imputing misconduct on his  part was  issued to him. The respondent filed O.A in the Administrative  Tribunal challenging the validity of the charge memo  dated September  28, 1991.  The Tribunal in the impugned order dated April 15 1994 set aside the charge memo on the ground that the charges were vague. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It is  settled law by catena of decisions of this Court that if  the charge  memo is  totally  vague  and  does  not disclose any  misconduct for  which the  charges  have  been framed, the  Tribunal or the Court would not be justified at that stage to go into whether the charges are true and could be gone  into, for it would he a matter on production of the evidence for  consideration at  the enquiry  by the  enquiry officer.  At  the  stage  of  framing  of  the  charge,  the statement  of  facts  and  the  charge  sheet  supplied  are required to  be looked  into by the Court or the Tribunal as to the nature of the charges, i.e., whether the statement of facts and  material  in  support  thereof  supplied  to  the delinquent officer  would disclose  the alleged  misconduct. The Tribunal,  therefore, was  totally unjustified  in going into the  charges at that stage. It is not the case that the charge memo  and the  statement of facts do not disclose any misconduct   alleged   against   the   delinquent   officer. Therefore, the  Tribunal was  totally wrong  in quashing the charge memo.  In similar  circumstances, in respect of other persons involved  in the  same transactions,  this Court  in appeals arising  out of  SLP (C) Nos.19453-63 of 1995 had on February 9,  1996 allowed  the appeals,  set aside the order http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 passed by the Tribunal and remitted the matter holding that: ""This is not the stage at which the truth or  otherwise of  the charges ought to  be looked  into.

Notification under Section  4(1) of  the Land  Acquisition Act,  1894 was published on May 25, 1976 acquiring the land in question for the purpose  of establishing  the agricultural  market yard. The award  under Section 11 was made by the Collector on May 10, 1977.  On reference the Additional District Judge by his award and  decree dated  September  15,  1979  enhanced  the compensation to  Rs.10/- per  sq. yd.  with solatium at  15% and interest  at 6%.  On appeal, the High Court enhanced the compensation to  Rs.15/- per  sq. yd.  The High  Court  also enhanced solatium and interest under the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 as well as the additional amount under Section 23(1-A). Thus these appeals by special leave. It is  not necessary  to dilate  upon all the facts but the point  that another  Division  Bench  had  followed  the earlier order  and awarded  common market  value to all tile http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 lands. Though  Shri O.P.  Rana, learned  senior counsel,  is right that  in the  first case  the Division  Bench had  not given cogent reason For enhancement of the market value from Rs.10/- to  Rs.15/sq. yd.,  we find that the reference Court had given  various reasons for confining to the market value at Rs.10/-  per sq.  yd. Though  the basis  under  with  the market value  was determined by the High Court was not after proper appreciation  of evidence,  the principle involved in determining the compensation cannot be faulted Though we are not satisfied  with t  e reasoning of the Division Bench, we are not  inclined to  interfere with  the enhancement of the compensation to  Rs: 15/- per sq. yd. However, the claimants are not  entitled to  the enhanced solatium and interest and also the  additional amount  since the  reference Court  had made the award and decree on September 15, 1979 that is much earlier to  the introduction  of the  Amendment Act 68/1984.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the learned  single Judge  of the  High Court  of  Punjab  & Haryana passed  in Civil Revision Petition No. 1191 of 1995. The appellant-Association  is seeking  preservation  of  the green belt  in Sector  7 marked in the plans prepared by the Faridabad Urban  Development Authority.  The  appellant  had filed a  civil suit  for perpetual injunction refraining the respondents from  converting the  green belt  into a  petrol pump to  be run  by the  first respondent.  The trial Court, pending suit,  though initially  it had  granted  ad-interim injunction, vacated  the same.  The District Judge held that facie case  for granting injunction was made out against the respondents. Accordingly  ad-interim injunction was granted. On revision,  the High  Court has  vacated the  order of the appellate Court  and affirmed  that of the trial Court. Thus this appeal by special leave. After  spending  considerable  time,  in  view  of  the material on  record, we  cannot hold  that the High Court is wholly unjustified  in interfering  with the  order  of  the appellate Court.  However, since  the suit  is  pending,  we decline to go into the merits of the case. Therefore, we are not inclined  to interfere with the order of the High Court. However, the  observations  and  findings  recorded  by  the courts below should not in any way affect the final disposal of the suit. On the facts and circumstances of this case, we think that  the trial  Judge should  dispose of  the suit as expeditiously as  possible within  a period  of four  months from the  date of receipt of this order. Pending disposal of the suit,  the first respondent is at liberty to continue to run the petrol pump, as it exists today, without causing any detriment to  the environment. Any action taken by the first respondent would be subject to the result in the suit. It is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 needless  to  mention  that  the  first  respondent  is  not entitled to  plead any equity at the time of disposal of the suit.

" J U D G M E N T O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) No.303/2002) Leave granted. Plaintiff-appellants filed a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the ’Act’) complaining of their dispossession of immovable property otherwise than in due course of law by the respondents.  The suit was contested.  Evidence, oral and documentary, was adduced.  The trial Court found the plaintiff-appellants entitled to a decree and hence decreed the suit. The defendant-respondents filed a revision under Section 115 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter ’the Code’, for short).  The revision has been allowed and the suit filed by the plaintiff-appellants directed to be dismissed.  Feeling aggrieved, the plaintiffs have come up in appeal by special leave. A suit under Section 6 of the Act is often called a summary suit inasmuch as the enquiry in the suit under Section 6 is confined to finding out the possession and dispossession within a period of six months from the date of the institution of the suit ignoring the question of title.  Sub-Section (3) of Section 6 provides that no appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this Section.  No review of any such order or decree is permitted.  The remedy of a person unsuccessful in a suit under Section 6 of the Act is to file a regular suit establishing his title to the suit property and in the event of his succeeding he will be entitled to recover possession of the property notwithstanding the adverse decision under Section 6 of the Act.  Thus, as against a  decision under Section 6 of the Act, the remedy of unsuccessful party is to file a suit based on title.  The remedy of filing a revision is available but that is only by way of an exception; for the High Court would not interfere with a decree or order under Section 6 of the Act except on a case for interference being made out within the well settled parameters of the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code. A perusal of the order of the High Court shows that the High Court has for the purpose of reversing the decree of the trial Court relied on the oral statements of Natai Sheikh, PW-3 and Ram Sevak Ram, PW-5.  One sentence each from the two depositions has been extracted and set out by the High Court in its order for the purpose of forming an opinion that they are not the plaintiffs but the defendants who were in possession of the suit property before six months from the date of the institution of the suit.  The High Court has not looked http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 into all the material available on record and has also not indicated clearly the availability of any of the grounds within the parameters of Section 115 of the Code so as to exercise revisional jurisdiction calling for reversal of the decision of the trial Court under Section 6 of the Act.  The revision filed before the High Court cannot be said to have been satisfactorily disposed of. The appeal is allowed.  The impugned order of the High Court is set aside.  The civil revision in the High Court shall stand restored to file for hearing and decision afresh in accordance with law.  No order as to the costs in this appeal.

Bhasme for the Petitioners. A.K. Gupta for the Respondents. The Judgment. of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. The High Court of Bombay dismissed PG NO 641 PG NO 642 the  challenge  to the award in question. The  award  is  an unreasoned one. The transactions between the parties started some  time  in  1974. The petitioners  participated  in  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reference  in  1979, without demur. In 1981, the  award  was made. No objection was taken at that time that the award was bad  being  an unreasoned one. The matter is pending  for  a long time. It is not desirable, in the interest of  justice, to  keep this matter pending because some cases are  pending here on the question of the validity of unreasoned award per se. The parties participated in the arbitration. There is no allegation  of  any  violation  of  principles  of   natural justice.   One   of   the   contentions   in   support    of this  application was that relevant documents had  not  been taken into consideration. The High Court has pointed out  on reading  the  award  that  it does  not  indicate  that  all relevant documents had not been taken into consideration. On the facts of this case, from the records and on the face  of the award there is no mistake of law apparent on the face of the  award  or  gross  mistake of  facts  resulting  in  the miscarriage  of  justice or of equity.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. We have  heard the  counsel on  both  sides.  This appeal by  special leave  arises from the orders passed by the  High Court of Himachal Pradesh. In this case in CWP No.722/93  dated 10.9.1993,  the Division  Bench of the High  Court has  disposed of  the  matters  on  the ground  that   the  respondents   were  re-engaged   as Assistant Development  Officers on daily wages pursuant to the  direction by it . It is settled law that having made rules of recruitment to various services under the State or to a class of posts under the State, the State is bound  to follow  the same and to have the selection of the  candidates made  as per  recruitment rules  and appointments shall be made accordingly. From the date of discharging  the duties  attached to  the  post  the incumbent becomes a member of the services. Appointment on daily  wage basis  is not  an appointment  to a post according to the Rules. It  is   seen  that   the  project  in  which  the respondents were  engaged had  come to an end and that, therefore, they  have necessarily  been terminated  for want of  work. The  Court cannot give any directions to re-engage them  in  any  other  work  or  appoint  them against existing  vacancies.  Otherwise,  the  judicial process would  become other mode of recruitment de hors the rules. Mr.  Mahabir   Singh,  learned   counsel  for  the respondents contended  that there  was an  admission in the counter  affidavit filed  in the  High  Court  that there  were   vacancies  and   that,   therefore,   the respondents are entitled to be continued in service. We do not agree with the contention. The vacancies require to be  filled up  in accordance  with the rules and all http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the  candidates   who  would   otherwise  eligible  are entitled to apply for when recruitment is made and seek consideration of their claims on merit according to the Rules  for   direct  recruitment  along  with  all  the eligible candidates.  The appointment  on  daily  wages cannot be a conduct pipe for regular appointments which would  be   a  back-door   entry,  detrimental  to  the efficiency of service and would breed seeds of nepotism and corruption. It is equally settled law that even for Class IV  employees recruitment according to rules is a pre-condition. Only  work-charged employees who perform the duties  of transitory nature are appointed not to a post but are required to perform the work of transitory and urgent  nature so  long as  the  work  exists.  One temporary  employee   cannot  be  replaced  by  another temporary employee. Under these  circumstances, the  view of  the High Court is  not correct.  lt is accordingly set aside. It is mentioned  that the respondents have become overaged by now.  If they  apply for  any regular appointment by which time  if they  become barred  by age the State is directed to  consider necessary relaxation of their age to the extent of their period of service on daily wages and then to consider their cases according to rules, if they are otherwise eligible.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 3342  of 1979. From  the  Judgment  and Order dated  28.4.1978  of  the Allahabad High Court in Second Civil Appeal No. 300 of 1975. O.P. Rana and Raju Ramachandran for the Appellant. Vivek Ghambir and Praveen Kumar for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK,  CJ.  This is a landlord’s  appeal  by  special leave arising out of a suit for ejectment. The respondent’s father B.M. Paul, was the tenant of the premises  in question. On his death he left behind  the  re- spondent,  his mother, brothers and sisters  who  in-herited the  tenancy.  A  notice under s. 106  of  the  Transfer  of Property  Act terminating the tenancy was addressed  to  the respondent  and was served on him. It was not addressed  and served on the other tenants. A suit for ejectment was  filed by the appellant against the respondent. The validity of the notice  to  quit was challenged by the  respondent.  It  was contended that notice should have been addressed to  all-the members of the family and served on them, and in the absence of  notice to all the suit was incompetent. The trial  court upheld the validity of the notice relying upon the  decision of the Allahabad High Court in Shrimati Vishnawati v.  Bhag- wat  Vithu Chowdhry, [1969] A.L.J. 1131 on the footing  that the  defendants were joint tenants and constituted a  single unit  and  therefore  notice to one of  the  defendants  was sufficient  to determine the tenancy. The view proceeded  on the  basis  that the heirs of the original tenant  held  the tenancy as joint tenants. When the matter ultimately came to the  High  Court in second appeal, the High Court  took  the view  that  as heirs of the deceased tenant  they  held  the tenancy  as  tenants  in common and not  as  joint  tenants. Accordingly, the High Court said, notice to quit should have been  served on each one of the successor tenants.  In  that view, the High Court allowed the appeal and 771 dismissed  the suit. The High Court relied on  Ramesh  Chand Bose  v.  Gopeshwar Prasad Sharrna, AIR 1977  ’Allahabad  38 where  it was held that a tenancy was a  heritable  property right  and the heirs of the deceased tenant  became  tenants themselves. In this appeal the entire question is whether the notice addressed to the respondent alone is a valid notice. It is now well settled that on the death of the original tenant,  subject  to any provision to  the  contrary  either negativing  or limiting the succession, the  tenancy  rights devolve  on the heirs of the deceased tenant. The  incidence of the tenancy are the same as those enjoyed by the original tenant. It is a single tenancy which devolves on the  heirs. There is no division of the premises or of the rent  payable therefor.  That is the position as between the landlord  and the heirs of the deceased tenant. In other words, the  heirs succeed to the tenancy as joint tenants. In the present case it  appears that the respondent acted on behalf of the  ten- ants,  that  he paid rent on behalf of all and  he  accepted notice  also  on behalf of all. In  the  circumstances,  the notice served on the respondent was sufficient. It seems  to us  that  the  view taken in Ramesh Chand  Bose  (supra)  is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 erroneous  where the High Court lays down that the heirs  of the  deceased  tenant succeed as tenants in common.  In  our opinion, the notice under s. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act  served  by the appellant on the respondent is  a  valid notice and therefore the suit must succeed. In  the result, the appeal is allowed, the judgment  and decree of the High Court are set aside and the judgment  and decree  of the First Appellate Court are restored. There  is no order as to costs. P.S.S.

This order will govern the  disposal of  Civil Appeals Nos. 2634 of 1969 and 63 of  1970.   These two  appeals  arise out of two writ petitions filed  in  the High  Court  of  Delhi which were disposed of  by  a  common judgment delivered by a learned single Judge on December  5, 1969.  The appeals have been brought on certificate  granted suo  motu by the learned single Judge under Art.  132(1)  of the Constitution of India.  While granting the  certificate, the  learned single Judge observed that at an earlier  stage in  the  case, request was made to him to  refer  these  two petitions  for  decision  to  a  Bench,  because   important questions were involved in them.  At that time, the  learned Judge felt that since there was a Division Bench decision of the  Rajasthan High Court in Jaipur Udyog Ltd. v.  Union  of India  and another(’) there was no need to refer the  matter to a larger Bench.  The learned Judge goes on to say in  the order granting certificate that at the time of the  hearing, he found that several questions arose before him which  were not  covered  by the Rajasthan decision.  He  probably  felt that  as  the  points  which  he  had  to  decide  were  not considered  by this Court in any earlier decision and as  he had  decided  the  case  sitting  singly,  he  should  grant certificate suo motu for appeal to this Court. In our opinion, and we say it respectfully, the learned Judge was in error in not making a reference to a Bench when he found that important questions of law were arising before him.  Even if he did not make any reference, he should  have allowed  the  parties to take an appeal in  the  High  Court itself  under the provisions pertaining to  appeals  against decisions  of a single Judge.  The practice of deciding  the case  sitting  singly and giving a  certificate  under  Art. 132(1)  for  appeal  to  this  Court  although   technically correct,  is an improper practice.  If is the right  of  the party to file an appeal in the High Court itself against the decision  of the single Judge and that right should  not  be short-circuited by passing on the case to the Supreme  Court for decision.  We think we should not endorse this  practice which would create a bad precedent in India.  We accordingly cancel the certificate and leave the parties free to file an appeal in the High Court, it they so desire.  There will  be no order as to cost s. V.P.S.     Certificate Cancelled.

At the time of hearing of this appeal also, no one has appeared before us to contest the appeal. 3.      This appeal is directed against the Judgment and Order dated 5th of December, 2006 passed by a learned Judge (Chief Justice) of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Simla in CMP (M) No. 821 of 2006, by which the High Court had dismissed the appeal on a technical ground that the appeal was not maintainable under Section 30 (1)(a) of the Workmen\022s Compensation Act, 1923 (in short the \023Act\024) as the memorandum of appeal was not accompanied by a Certificate issued by the Commissioner, Workmen\022s Compensation, to show that the appellant had deposited with him the amount payable under the order which was appealed. 4.      We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and examined the relevant provisions made under Section 30 of the Act and other materials on record. After a careful examination, we are of the view that in the absence of any specified form of Certificate indicated in the Act or the Rules, it cannot be said that the Certificate produced by the appellant was not in compliance with Section 30 of the Act.  It is an admitted fact that the appellant had deposited the awarded amount by way of a Demand Draft duly received by the office of the Commissioner.  The Demand Draft was deposited along with a covering letter and the receipt was given on its copy.  The High Court had refused to accept it as a Certificate under the Act and therefore, dismissed the appeal. 5.      In our view, in the absence of any specified form of Certificate, a proof of deposit of compensation would be a substantial compliance of Section 30 of the Act.  Therefore, the appellant could not be thrown out on such a technical ground. 6.      That being the position, we set aside the Judgment of the High Court and request the High Court to decide the appeal filed under Section 30 of the Act in accordance with law and after giving hearing to the parties, dispose of the same after passing a reasoned order within six months from the date of supply of a copy of this order. 7.

Hon’ble R.M. Sahai, J.  had  taken  a  different  view  on  that  matter. However, on  merit both  agreed for shifting of the date for payment of the compensation to the later date of declaration as under : ""Though for  different reasons,  we have come  to the  same conclusions that the  civil  appeals  and  writ petitions  shall  stand  dismissed. But the  appellants and petitioners shall be  paid compensation  on the market rate  prevalent in  the year the   declaration    analogous   to section 6  of the  Land Acquisition Act, 1894  were issued.  In view of the  special   facts  and  peculiar circumstances and  nor as of Law we have adapted this course."" Subsequently, the  question was  considered by  another Bench of this Court in U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Lucknow vs. Lata Awasthi [(1995) 3 SCC 573] wherein it was held that the Amendment  Act has  no application  since  some  of  the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894(1 of 1894) were incorporated  into   the  Adhiniyam.   The  same   view  was reiterated in  Ramesh Chandra  Tiwari &  ors. vs.  U.P. Avas http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Evam Vikas Parishan, Lucknow [CA No.1832/86] decided January 8,1996 by  another   Bench. Under these circumstances, it is now settled  law that  the Land Acquisition Amendment Act 68 of  1894,   has  no   application.  The  notification  under Adhiniyam similar  to section  4 and the declaration similar to Section  6 do  not stand  lapsed after  the expiry of two years from  the date  the Amendment Act has come into force. The High  Court, therefore,  was right  in refusing to grant the relief. The Land  Acquisition Officer  is directed  to pass the award in  accordance with  law within  a period of six weeks from the  date of  the receipt  of this  order. If  the Land Acquisition Officer  does not  pass the  award  within  that period, he should award interest on the amount awarded @ 18% from the  date of  the expiry  of six weeks till the date of the  deposit   with  him   of  the   compensation   by   the requisitioning authority. In any event, if the amount is not deposited with the Land Acquisition Officer within a further period  of   three  months  thereafter,  there  shall  be  a direction to  the State  Government  to  withdraw  from  the acquisition. The appeal is accordingly ordered. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgement and order  of the Division  Bench of the High  Court of Allahabad made on November 1,1995 in W.P. No.30914/95.

No. 436 of 2001 and dated 27.10.2005 in R.A. No.8 of 2005, New India Assurance Company Ltd. through its Regional Manager, New Delhi has filed the above appeal. 3)      Brief facts are as follows: Smt. Kendra Devi, respondent No.1 herein, filed  Claim Petition - M.A.C. No.4 of 1994,  before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Uttarkashi, claiming compensation of Rs.4,67,000/- on account of death of her husband in a motor vehicle accident.  According to respondent No.1 herein, her husband, Prakash Singh Parmar, was the owner and driver of Taxi No. UMX 491.  On 10.11.1993 while her husband was going from Matali to Uttarkashi, he lost control over the vehicle and met with an accident due to which the vehicle rolled into the river Bhagirathi near Barrthi.  Her husband sustained fatal injuries in the accident and succumbed to the injuries at the spot.  According to respondent No.1, at the time of the accident her husband was earning Rs.3000/- per month. 4)      Before the Tribunal, the appellant, New India Assurance Co. Ltd. contended that the vehicle was insured only for five persons whereas it was carrying eight passengers, therefore, the owner and driver of the vehicle violated the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, in view of the same, they are not liable to pay compensation to the claimants.  The Tribunal, based on the materials before it, after finding that the driver of the vehicle had valid licence and taking note of the age of the deceased i.e., 50 years, by applying multiplier of ten, awarded a total compensation of Rs.1,25,000/- along with interest @ 12%.  Aggrieved by the said award, the Insurance Company filed an appeal before the High Court.  The High Court, after finding no infirmity and illegality in the order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, dismissed the appeal and the review application filed by the Insurance Company was also dismissed.  Against the said orders of the High Court, the New India Assurance Company Ltd.  filed the present appeal. 5)      Heard learned counsel appearing for the appellant-New India Assurance Company as well as the respondents- claimants. 6)      The only contention of the learned counsel for the appellant-Insurance Company, is that inasmuch as the insurance policy was issued for \023paid driver\024 and not for \023owner\024 who also happened to drive the vehicle himself at the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 time of the accident.  In support of his contention, learned counsel drew our attention to the Insurance Policy(Annexure P-3).   Perusal of the Schedule of Premium mentioned in the Insurance Policy,  shows that apart from liability to public risk, the owner has paid premium only for  \023paid driver and/or conductor\024.  By contending that in the case on hand, the deceased being the owner-cum-driver and without additional premium/coverage for owner-cum-driver, the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation for death of the deceased who was owner-cum-driver and not paid driver as mentioned in the Schedule of Premium.  In support of his contention, learned counsel for the appellant heavily relied on Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 which speaks about the statutory liabilities and a decision of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Meera Bai & Ors., (2006) 9 SCC 174. 7)      We have carefully considered the above provision as well the decision of this Court.  Taking note of the peculiar fact that the claimants have lost their only breadwinner, we are not inclined to interfere with the concurrent orders of the Tribunal as well as the High Court.  Consequently, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.","Smt. Kendra Devi, respondent No.1 herein, filed  Claim Petition - M.A.C.

As per Section 100 of Code of Civil Procedure, before the High Court admits a second appeal,  it is required to formulate and record the substantial questions of law which require consideration of the Court.

" JUDGMENT 2000 Supp(2) SCR 710 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The petitioner was 10 years old when his mother died, while she was working as a Excise Constable, The petitioner made an application on 2.6.1988, soon after the death of his mother, seeking compassionate appointment. That was rejected on 10.12.1996, as time-barred. A fresh application was filed on 26.12.96 and that was also rejected on 21.4.1997 for the same reason. Against the said order, the petitioner moved the High Court. The learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition on 24.8.99 and the said judgment was affirmed by the Division Bench on 10.3.2000. Against order that this SLP has been preferred. Learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has placed strong reliance on the decision of a learned Single Judge of the Patna High Court in Chandra Bhushan v. State of Bihar, (1997) 1 PUR 626, Learned senior counsel points out that it was held in that case that an applicant’s right cannot be defeated on the ground of delay caused by authorities which was beyond the control of the applicant. Learned senior counsel further points out that instead of following the above judgment, the same learned Judge has now held on 21.4.1997 that the application is time-barred. Learned counsel has placed before us a judgment of this Court in Director of Education & Anr. v, Pushpendra Kumar & Ors,, (1998) 2 PLJR SC 181. He’subnuts that, in this case, a direction was given to create supernumerary posts. We are unable to agree with the submissions of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner. This Court has held in a number of cases that compassionate appointment is intended to enable the family of the deceased employee to tide over sudden crisis resulting due to death of the bread earner who had left the family in penury and without any means of livelihood. In fact such a view has been expressed in the very decision cited by the petitioner in Director of Education & Anr. v. Pushpendra Kumar & Ors. supra. It is also Significant to notice that on the date when the first application was made by the petitioner on 2.6.88, the petitioner was a minor and was not eligible for appointment. This is conceded by the petitioner. There cannot be reservation of a vacancy till such time as the petitioner becomes a major after a number of years, unless there is some specific provisions. The very basis of compas-sionate appointment is to see that the family gets immediate relief. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the view expressed in Chandra Bhushan’s case. For the reasons stated above, we hold that there are no merits in this SLP and the same is accordingly dismissed. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","Petitioner was 10 years old when his mother died, while she was working as a Excise Constable.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.   The facts are telling that the appellant was  appointed in  the  Revenue  Department as  Second  Division  Clerk  in Manglore  on October 8, 1963.  He was sent on deputation  to the  Food and Civil Supplies Department which was then  part of Revenue-Department as Assistant Civil Supplies  Inspector on December 26, 1967 and was promoted as Second Grade  Civil Supplies Inspector on September 11, 1968 which is stated  to be  equivalent  to  Sheristedar.   The  5th  respondent  Mr. R.K.Vasudev  was  appointed as a Second  Division  Clerk  on January  22,  1965 in Food Wing of the  Revenue  Department- Thereafter  he was regularised as Second Division  Clerk  on September 30, 1971 and was promoted as a Sheristedar on June 17, 1982.  From these facts, it is clear that at all  levels of  appointments  and promotions, the appellant  was  always senior  to  5th respondent.  But one fact  that  remains  on record  is that the appellant continued to be on  deputation in the Food Wing of Revenue Department.  When he was  sought to   be   repatriated,  the  appellant   filed   APplication No.6432/86  before the Administrative  Tribunal,  Bangalore. The  Tribunal by its order dated January 28,  1988  directed absorption  of  the  appellant in  the  Food  Department  as indicated in the order which reads thus: ""Since  the applicant is working in  the  Food and Civil Supplies Department since 1966(about 32  years  and  he  has  not  been  given  any proforma  promotion in the Revenue  Department and  there are no valid ground to  reject  his request   for  absorption,  we  are   of   the considered  opinion  that  the  Applicant   is entitled for a direction to the respondents to absorb him in the Department of Food and Civil Supplies  in the post now held by him.  It  is ordered  accordingly after  quashing  Annexure http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A."" Subsequent  thereto it would appear that  the appellant  was absorbed and he was placed above the 5th respondent and also promoted  on  January 1, 1980 as a Assistant  Director.   It would  also appear from the record that the  5th  respondent also  promoted  as Asia Director.  The only question  is  of inter  se  seniority  between the  appellant  and  the  5th- respondent.  Shri Rama Jois, learned senior counsel for  the respondent  contended that the Rules prescribed that on  the deputation  the post should be the post equivalent to  which he  was holding in the parent department and  the  appellant cannot be transferred and deputed in the Food Wing on higher post  than the post hold in the parent  department.   Though there  is force in the contention as per the Rules but  meat of  the matter is that the appellant uninterruptedly  worked in  the  Food  department  till date of  the  order  by  the Tribunal.   Under these circumstances, though  initially  he might  have mistakenly been deputed to hold  higher post  in the  Food & Civil Supplies Department, since  the  appellant had   obviously  discharged  his  duties  and   higher   re- sponsibilities to the satisfaction of all concerned, at this distance  of time, it is highly unjust to send him  back  to hold  the  post  in  the present  department  which  he  was entitled to hold and the Tribunal is not 644 right  to  interfere with action of the  department  in  its absorption  of the appellant as per its own  earlier  order. The  direction given by the Tribunal at the instance of  5th respondent  in  the impugned order dated July  10,  1994  is accordingly  set aside and the order issued in  the  earlier proceedings  stands confirmed.  In consequence the order  of absorption  and the promotion given to the  appellant  stand upheld.  The appeal is allowed.  No costs. 646","Vasudev was sent on deputation to the Food and Civil Supplies Department which was then part of Revenue-Department.

" WITH S.L.P. Nos. 2397, 2620 & 2622 OF 1990 O R D E R The notification  under  Section  4  (1)  of  the  Land Acquisition Act,  1894 (for  short, ‘the  Act’) acquiring  a large extent  of land  for development  of  Delhi  city  was published on  6th April,  1964. The Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation  @ Rs.5,000/- and Rs. 4,500/- per bigha by his  award No.87  of 1980-81.  On  reference,  the  Civil Court, viz.,  the Additional  District Judge, enhanced it by his award  and decree  dated 30th August, 1983 to Rs.7,260/- and Rs.7,000/-  per bigha  respectively. On appeal, the High Court by  the impugned judgment dated 22nd August, 1989 made in R.F.A.  No.52/89 and  batch uniformly enhanced the market value to  Rs.12,000/- per  bigha.  Feeling  aggrieved,  this petition  has   been  filed   for  further   enhancement  to Rs.25,000/ per bigha. The learned  counsel for  the petitioners  states  that these lands  relate to  village Madanpur Khadar. He contends that  for   the  adjacent  lands  in  village  Badarpur  and Molarband, the  Reference Court  and the High Court enhanced the compensation  to Rs.43,000/-  per bigha  etc. Therefore, the High  Court was  not justified  in confining  the market value to Rs.12,000/- per bigha. We have  gone through  the judgments  in  those  cases. Reliance was  placed on the circular, issued obviously under Section 48  of the  Stamp Act,  by  the  Central  Government fixing the  market value  for the purpose of registration at Rs.60/- per  sq. yard.  This Court has considered the entire gamut of  the operation  of the relevant provisions of Stamp Act and  S.23 (1)  of the  Act and held that the fixation by the Government  of the  amount under  Stampt Act  for fiscal purpose bears  no relevance  to determine  the market  value under Section  23 (1)  of the Act. The claimant aliunde need to establish  the prevailing  market value as on the date of the  notification  under  Section  4  (1)  by  adduction  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 evidence to  prove the acquired land and the land covered by sale transactions  bear similar  or same  potentialities  or advantageous features.  The courts below have relied only on the circular  issued by  the Government  for fiscal purpose, viz., for  stamp duty.  The contra  view taken  by the  High Court in  that behalf is clearly illegal and the same cannot form basis  for  further  enhancement.  De  hors  the  above judgment, there  is no  other evidence  to  enhance  further compensation. Learned counsel  for the petitioners also relied on the judgment of  the High  Court in relation to the motification dated 5th July, 1973 in which the compensation was awarded @ Rs.68,000/- per  bigha for village Tughlakabad. That is also founded upon  the circular  issued by the Government on 26th March,  1966   referred  to   earlier  and   relates  to   a notification issued  after about 10 years of the notifiction at hand. So this judgment also renders little assistance. Accordingly, the special leave petitions are dismissed.","Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation @ Rs.5,000/- and Rs. 4,500/- per bigha by his award No.87 of 1980-81.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3615 OF 1997 (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 1670 of 1994) O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. The facts  the in  appeal arising  out of  SLP (C)  No. 1670/94 are that notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act,  1894 was  published  on  August  11,  1971 acquiring 700  acres of  land.

The   appellants   filed   their application under  Section 28-A  on April  30,  1985  within three months  from   the date  of the award of the reference Court. It  was not  decided. Again,  enhancement was made by the High  Court by  judgment dated January 5, 1995 enhancing the compensation to Rs. 650/- per fruit bearing tree in F.A. No. 166/84.  The appellants again made an application on May 23,  1990  before  the  Land  Acquisition  Officer  for  re- determination,  which  was  rejected.  The  High  Court  has dismissed the  writ petitions on April 30, 1993. Thus, these appeals by special leave. In   view of the fact that the appellants had filed the written reference  applications within three months from the date of  the award  enhanced compensation  by the  reference Court in the connected matters, which are admittedly covered under the  same notification  issued under Section 4(1), the appellants are  entitled to  seek a  reference under Section 28-A but  was not  done.

It reads : ""  Provided that the Assistants or, as the case may be, Senior Grade Stenographers, who have completed 15 years of continuous service as on 1-8-1981 are exempted from passing the Higher Accounts Test:"" The question is while reckoning the period of 15 years of continuous service as on 1-8-1981 whether the entire period of service rendered by Assistants or Senior Grade Stenographers is to be counted or only the period as Assistants or Stenographers as the case may be.

The State preferred appeals to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the High Court for enhancement of the sentences.

We  do  not  think  that  we  will  be justified in  issuing a show-cause notice to the respondents when no  attempt has been made to place all the facts before us by filing the necessary documents.

" ORDER 1.Naicker,  respondent in appeal herein, instituted  a  suit for declaration and possession in respect of the property in dispute against Mari, the appellant defendant, before us  in this  appeal.   The suit was dismissed by the  trial  court. The  lower appellate court upheld the findings of the  trial court and dismissed the appeal.  The High Court, however, in second appeal reversed the findings of the two courts  below and decreed the suit. 2.The  facts  in  a  nutshell are  that  Mari  agreed  to purchase  the property in dispute from Kandappa  Gounder  by way  of the agreement dated October 17, 1966.  According  to Mari  he fell short of money and as such approached  Naicker and borrowed a sum of Rs 4000 from him and as a security for the loan he got the sale deed executed in favour of  Naicker on  April  9, 1967 in respect of the  property  in  dispute. Thereafter, Naicker entered into an agreement dated April 9, 1967  with  Mari to sell the same property to  him.   It  is further  not disputed that Mari got the property in  dispute on lease from Naicker by way of a lease deed dated April 12, 1967.  The three last mentioned documents were registered. 3.The case of the respondent-plaintiff was that the  sale deed  dated  April 9, 1967 being registered  was  valid  and genuine and as such he was entitled to have the  declaration and possession of the suit property.  On the other hand, the appellant-defendant claimed that all the three  transactions were sham, he had borrowed a sum of Rs 4000 from Naicker and the documents were entered only to secure the payment of the said  loan.  The trial court, on appreciation  of  evidence, came  to  the  conclusion  that the sale  deed  was  a  sham transaction  and was only entered into to secure  the  loan. As  mentioned  above the lower appellate  court  upheld  the findings of the trial Court. 4.We  are  of  the  view that  the  High  Court  was  not justified  in  reversing the findings of  fact  concurrently reached  by the trial court and the lower  appellate  court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 There  was no question of law, whatsoever, before  the  High Court  in the second appeal.  The High Court went  into  the evidence, re-appreciated the same and reversed the  findings of   the  courts  below.   The  High  Court   exceeded   the jurisdiction vested in it under Section 100 Civil  Procedure Code.   We,  therefore,  allow the  appeal,  set  aside  the judgment  of  the High Court and restore that of  the  trial court  and  dismiss the suit  of  the  respondent-plaintiff. While  allowing  the appeal we are of the view that  in  the facts  and  circumstances  of this  case,  the  interest  of justice  would be squarely met if the appellant is  directed to  pay  a  sum of Rs 25,000 to the  respondent  by  way  of compensation.   We order accordingly.  The  appellant  shall pay  the  SLIM of Rs 25,000 to the respondent  within  three months  from  today.  Failing to pay the amount  within  the said  period it shall earn interest at the rate of  15%  per annum thereafter.  The appeal is allowed and disposed of  in the above terms.

B. P. Singh and L. R. Singh for the Appellants. S. N. Jha and U. P. Singh for the Respondent. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.  We  have  heard  the  arguments  of appellants’ counsel with specific reference to Munni Marandi and Babua  Marandi the  appellants herein. We have also read through the evidence relating to these accused persons aided by counsel  for the  State. The  role  attributed  to  Munni http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Marandi is  that he  was a  member of the crowd which chased the deceased  and in that sense was liable under Section 149 read with  326 I.P.C. We cannot fault the High Court for the conviction rendered, but having due regard to the age of the accused and  to the absence of any overt act on his part, we consider that  a sentence  of two  years’ R.I.  will, in the circumstances of this case, meet the ends of justice. 588 Babua Marandi, a boy aged 15, was also in the crowd. In the excited  chase of  the deceased,  this boy also followed and  when  the  actual  sword  thrust  was  made  by  Ranjit Chaudhry, this  boy held  the deceased.  In this  sense, his part is  different from  that of  Munni Marandi. We are not, therefore, disposed  to interfere with his conviction or the sentence. Nevertheless,  it is  important to  remember  that Babua Marandi  was aged  15 years at time of the offence. It is regrettable-and this Court has pointed this out more than once-that there  is no  Children Act  in Bihar,  and in this International Year  of the  Child we  have to emphasize that the Legislature  is expected  to do its duty by the children of Bihar  by considering  the passing  of a measure like the Children Act  which long  ago had  been  circulated  by  the Central Government  and which exists in some other states in the country.  Be that  as it may, we are unable to deal with Babua Marandi  as a child for the simple reason that absence of  legislation   cannot  be   made  up   for  by   Judicial legislation.  All   that  we   can  do,   in   the   hapless circumstances of  the case  and in the helpless situation of legislative vacuum,  is to  direct  that  Babua  Marandi  be placed either  in an open prison or in a model prison or any other prison  available in  the State  where young offenders are kept  apart from the adult offenders. The special reason which induces  us to make this direction is that, as is well known, adolescents should be separated from adults in prison campuses. The  vices are  obvious and  we, therefore, direct accordingly. V.D.K.                                     Appeal dismissed. 589","Babua Marandi, a boy aged 15, was also in the crowd.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 353 of 1 969. From the  judgment and decree dated the 19th/20th July, 1965 of  the High  Court of  Gujarat at  Ahmedabad in  First Appeal No. 584 of 1960. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 M.N. phadke,  S. C.  Patel  and  R.N.  Poddar  for  the appellant. 552 D.V. Patel,  R.A. Shraff,  Gopal Subramaniam  and  D.P. Mohanty for the respondent. The order of the Court was delivered by KOSHAL, J.  The sole  respondent in this appeal died on the 10th  December,  1978.  He  was  also  arraigned  as  an appellant in  the connected appeal (Civil Appeal No. 2132 of 1977) in  which an application was made on the 20th February 1979 stating  the factum  and the date of the demise. A copy of that application was delivered on the date last mentioned to the  clerk of  learned counsel  for the  appellant State, who, however,  took no step to move the Court for having the legal representatives  of the deceased respondent brought on the record  in the present appeal till the 29th August, ]979 when an  application was  made for that purpose, but without being accompanied  by any  affidavit containing averments as to why the inordinate delay in filing the application should be condoned.  An affidavit  of the  type just  mentioned was filed in Court on 4th March, 198(). It is  common ground  between the  parties that  on the death of  the sole respondent to the appeal the right to sue survived to his legal representatives. No application having been made  within 90 days of the death, the appeal abated on the 11th  March. 1979  and an  application  for  having  the abatement set  aside could  have been made within the period of  60  days  following  that  date.  (Article  121  of  the Limitation Act).  The  application  actually  made  in  that behalf was  thus time-barred  by more  than 3  months and  a half. Mr. Phadke, learned counsel for the appellant does not dispute this  proposition. He urges. however, that the delay in making  the application last mentioned should be condoned and the  abatement of  the appeal  set aside.  No sufficient cause, however, for the condonation of the delay is made out from any material on the record. As pointed out earlier, the clerk of  the learned  counsel for  the appellant was served with a  copy of the application dated 23rd February, 1979 on that date  itself and no reason, good, bad or indifferent is assigned for the failure of that counsel right from the 20th February, 1979  to the  29th August,  1979 to move the Court till the  29th August,  1979 either  for  having  the  legal representatives of the deceased brought on the record or for having the abatement set aside after it had taken place. His knowledge of  the death of the respondent must be attributed to the appellant State 553 also and his negligence in not moving the Court in time must be deemed to be that of the appellant. Mr. Phadke also contended that he had a strong case for the acceptance  of the  appeal on  merits and  that the same should be regarded as a very good reason for the condonation of the  delay. The  contention is  wholly without substance. The abatement stands in the way of the appeal being heard on merits which cannot, therefore, be looked into. No grounds for the condonation of the delay having been made out we refuse to set aside the abatement. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. S.R.

Mishra, Advocates  for the appellant. Mr. N.P.Midha  and Mr.  Bharat  Sangal,  Advocates  for  the respondent. J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: M.K.MUKHERJEE, J. The respondent  was tried  for  and  convicted  of  the offences under  Section 161  of the  Indian Penal  Code an d 5(2) read with 5(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947  by   the  Special  Judge  (Vigilance),  Sambalpur  for accepting a  sum of  Rs. 500/- as illegal gratification from Mohd. Ushaman  (P.W.2), an employee of Rourkela Steel Plant. In  appeal   preferred  by  him  the  High  Court  that  the respondent received  the above  sum as illegal gratification and that  the defence  of the  respondent received the above sum as  illegal gratification  and that  t he defence of the respondent that  the above  amount was paid by P.W.2 as loan was unbelievable.  Inspite thereof  the High Court set aside the convictions  of the respondent solely on the ground that there was  no valid  sanction to  prosecute him.  The  above judgment is under challenge in this appeal. 2.   On perusal  of the  impugned judgment  we find that the High Court’s  attention was  not drawn  to the provisions of Section  465   of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  which expressly  lays   down,  inter   alia,  that  any  error  of irregularity in  any sanction  for the prosecution shall not be a  ground for  reversing an  order of  conviction by  the appellate Court  unless in  the  opinion  of  that  Court  a failure of  justice has in fact been occasioned thereby. The section further  lays down  that in  determining whether any error or  irregularity in  any sanction  for the prosecution has occasioned  a failure  of justice,  the Court shall have regard to  the fact  whether the  objection could and should have been  raised at an earlier stage of the proceedings. In http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 view of  the above provisions the High Court was required to decide, after  recording a finding that there was some error or irregularity  occasioned a failure of justice and further whether  such   objection  regarding  the  validity  of  the sanction was  raised in  the trial  Court.  Admittedly,  the above point was not raised in the trial Court nor do we find anything on  record from which it can be said that the error or irregularity  in the sanction (even if we assume that the finding of  the High  Court in  this regard  is correct) did occasion any  failure of justice. In that view of the matter it must be said that the High Court was not at all justified in acquitting the respondent on the ground that there was no valid  sanction  to  prosecute  him.  Since  on  facts,  the concurrent findings  of the Courts below are based on proper appreciation of evidence and supported by cogent reasons the judgment of the High Court has got to be reversed. 3.   Resultantly,  we  allow  this  appeal,  set  aside  the impugned judgment  and restore  the conviction  and sentence recorded against  t he  respondent by  the trial  Court.

" JUDGMENT S.B. SINHA, J. : 1. The defendant No. 4 in the original suit is the appellant before us. The plaintiff is the first respondent herein. The suit of the original plaintiff was dismissed. The defendant No. 4 did not prefer any appeal thereagainst. 2. Appellant claimed title over the land by adverse possession. The said claim was negatived by the learned Trial Judge. The First Appellate Court, however, opined that both the plaintiff (respondent No. 1 herein) and defendant No. 4 (appellant herein) had not acquired any title to the property. 3. Aggrieved by certain findings arrived at by the First Appellate Court, the appellant preferred a second appeal before the High Court of Madras which was dismissed summarily. The High Court opined that as defendant No. 4 did not file any suit nor the Trial Court having given any relief in that behalf, the appeal was not maintainable. 4. The appellant is before us aggrieved by the said order of the High Court. 5. There cannot be any doubt that the second appeal filed a the instance of the appellant herein was not maintainable as the First Appellate Court had merely arrived at certain findings which might be relevant for the purpose of determination of an issue by and between the appellant and the original plaintiff, but the same were not relevant for determination of an issue amongst the defendants inter se.

Chaitanya Sidharth and R.C.Verma, Advs. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: M. JAGANNADHA RAO, J. Leave granted. This is an appeal by the tenant against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Civil Revision Petition No. 56 of 1994 dated 6.3.1997. By that  judgment,   the  learned  Single  Judge  reversed  the concurrent findings  of the  appellate authority  as well as the Rent  Controller and  ordered the  eviction petition  in favour of the respondent-landlord. The eviction  application was  filed by  the respondent against appellants  in the year 1985 on three grounds namely wilful default, bonafide requirement for self-occupation and sub-letting. The  learned Rent  Controller by  his  judgment dated 31.7.1988 dismissed the eviction application. On appeal by the landlord the appeliate authority again framed three  points for consideration namely with regard to wilful default,  bonafide requirement  and  sub-letting  and came to  the conclusion that none of the grounds was proved. In the  result, the  appeal of the landlord was dismissed on 20.9.1993. The landlord  then filed revision in the High Court. It was merely observed by the High Court as follows: ""Having gone  through the orders of the courts  below, I  feel that the courts that  the petitioner has not made out  his bonafide  requirement and that  his bonafide  requirement is arbitrary.  There is evidence to show that the landlord requires the premises in  question for  starting his business. Hence both the orders under revision  deserve to  be  set http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 aside.  Accordingly  they  are  set aside."" Having held  so, the  learned Judge  granted two  years time i.e. upto 6.3.1989 for vacation. In this  appeal, it is contended by the learned counsel for the  tenant that  the High  Court has not considered and discussed the  relevant evidence  on the  basis of which the Rent Controller  and the  appellate authority  had held that the landlord  had not  established his bonafide requirement. On the  other hand,  it is  contended  for  the  respondent- landlord that this case is not a fit one for interference by this Court. We are  of the view that the High Court while reversing the concurrent  findings of  the appellate authority and the Rent Controller  ought to  have considered and discussed the evidence on  which the said authorities had held against the landlord. It was not sufficient for the High Court merely to sate that  there was  evidence to show that the bonafides of the landlord  was proved.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Challenge in this special leave petition is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Himachal Pradesh High Court dismissing the application filed by the petitioner- State under Section 378(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Code’). Grievance of the petitioner is that the application was dismissed summarily without indicating any reason. It is stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that this Court has in many cases deprecated the practice of such dismissal. The High Court has not given any reasons for refusing to grant leave to file appeal against acquittal, and seems to have been completely oblivious to the fact that by such refusal, a close scrutiny of the order of acquittal, by the appellate forum, has been lost once and for all. The manner in which appeal against acquittal has been dealt with by the High Court leaves much to be desired. Reasons introduce clarity in an order. On plainest consideration of justice, the High Court ought to have set forth its reasons, howsoever brief, in its order indicative of an application of its mind, all the more when its order is amenable to further avenue of challenge. The absence of reasons has rendered the High Court order not sustainable. Similar view was expressed in State of U.P. v. Battan and Ors (2001 (10) SCC 607). About two decades back in State of Maharashtra v. Vithal Rao Pritirao Chawan (AIR 1982 SC 1215) the desirability of a speaking order while dealing with an application for grant of leave was highlighted. The requirement of indicating reasons in such cases has been judicially recognized as imperative. The view was re-iterated in Jawahar Lal Singh v. Naresh Singh and Ors. (1987 (2) SCC 222).  Judicial discipline to abide by declaration of law by this Court, cannot be forsaken, under any pretext by any authority or Court, be it even the Highest Court in a State, oblivious to Article 141 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the ’Constitution’). Even in respect of administrative orders Lord Denning M.R. in Breen v. Amalgamated Engineering Union (1971 (1) All E.R. 1148) observed ""The giving of reasons is one of the fundamentals of good administration"". In Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Crabtree (1974 LCR 120) it was observed: ""Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice"". Reasons are live links between the mind of the decision taker to the controversy in question and the decision or conclusion arrived at"". Reasons substitute subjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis on recording reasons is that if the decision reveals the ""inscrutable face of the sphinx"", it can, by its silence, render it virtually impossible for the Courts to perform their appellate function or exercise the power of judicial review in adjudging the validity of the decision. Right to reason is an indispensable part of a sound judicial system, reasons at least sufficient to indicate an application of mind to the matter before Court. Another rationale is that the affected party can know why the decision has gone against him. One of the salutary requirements of natural justice is spelling out reasons for the order made, in other words, a speaking out. The ""inscrutable face of a sphinx"" is ordinarily incongruous with a judicial or quasi-judicial performance. (See State of Punjab v. Bhag Singh (2004 (1) SCC 547). In the background of what has been stated in Bhag Singh’s case (supra) the grievance of learned counsel for the petitioner-State about the manner in which the petition has been dismissed is unexceptionable.  But we have perused the judgment of the trial Court. Considering the nature of the findings recorded we do not consider this to be a fit case where exercise of jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution is called for. The petition is accordingly dismissed.",The High Court has not given any reasons for refusing to grant leave to file appeal against acquittal.

The Tribunal held that respondents Nos.  1 and 2 were protected tenants of the land and, therefore father of respondent No.  3 and no  right  to sell  it  without  following  the  procedure  prescribed  by Section 48 of the Hyderabad Agricultural Lands  and  Tenancy Act and Rule 31 A of the Rules made under that Act. Appeal  filed  against the order of the Tribunal was dismissed by the Deputy Collector, land Reforms, Latur.  The Maharastra Revenue Tribunal allowed  the  revision  petition and  held  that  the  sale  made  by Balwant Rao’s father in favour of Vishwanath was hit by Section 48 of  the  Act  and was, therefore,  void.    The appellant feeling aggrieved by the said  order  approached  the  High  Court  with  a  writ petition under  Article  227  of the Constitution.  The High Court summarily dismissed the same. Having  gone through the orders passed by Tehsildar, Latur, Deputy Collector, latur, and the Maharashtra  Revenue Tribunal  and the material on record we are of the view that the sale being  void  the  Revenue  Tribunal  was  right  in allowing the revision  application.  Respondents Nos.  1 and 2 were protected tenants  and  therefore  without  complying with the provisions of the Act and the Rules, no sale of the land could  have  been  validly  made.    Admittedly no such procedure was followed.  Therefore, we agree with  the  view taken  by  the  Tribunal  and  hold  that the High Court was justified in dismissing  the  writ  petition  filed  by  the appellant.   As  we  find  no substance in the appeal, it is dismissed.","An Application  filed by  respondents Nos.  1 and 2 for declaring the sate dt.  17.2.76 executed by  the  father of respondent  no.  3-Balwant  Rao in favour of appellant Vishwanath as null  and void was dismissed.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals  by special  leave arise  from the orders passed by  the Division  Bench of  the Allahabad  High Court dated May  14,   1996. It  is not  necessary to traverse the entire controversy. Suffice it to state that pursuant to the orders  passed  by  this  Court  on  July  13,    1987,  the appellants have  been depositing  @ Rs. 25,000/- p.m. on and before 10th  of every month from that date. This was further clarified by  the order  of this  Court dated  July 12, 1988 wherein this Court has stated that : ""We direct  further that as regards the terms  of the  Order dated 13th July  1987   made  by   this  Court directing the petitioner to deposit a sum  of Rs.  25,000/- per  month, the   petitioner  shall  make  such deposit in  a schedule  bank to the credit  of   an  interest   earning account opened  in the  name of the first respondent but it will not be open to  the  first  respondent  to withdraw  any   amount  from   such account without  the prior order of the  Court."" When   a clarification   was  sought for, this Court by order dated  October 7,1996  clarified in  I.A. No.  3/96 as under : ""It is clarified that the amount of Rs. 25,000/-  which is  required to be deposited  by the  petitioner in pursuance   of    the    directions contained in   the order dated July 13, 1987  and July 12, 1988 was not meant to  be the  rent for the part of the  premises in  the occupation of the petitioner and that the said amount is to be adjusted as per the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 final order  that is  passed in the proceedings  arising   out  of  the suit."" In view   of  the direction  issued by  this Court, the respondent would be entitled to withdraw the amount from the account with  the permission  of the orders of the Court but such withdrawal  would be  subject to  adjustment as per the final order  that may  be passed  by the  Civil Court in the pending suit.  the High  Court in  the  impugned  order  has directed  the   respondent  to   withdraw  the   amount   on furnishing bank guarantee as indicated in the order as under : ""Respondent No.11  to 14  shall  be allowed  to   withdraw  the  amount deposited   by    the    plaintiff- appellant in  terms of  the  orders passed by Hon’ble Supreme  Court on 13.7.1987 and  12.7.1988 after they furnish a  bank  guarantee  to  the extent  of   the  amount  lying  in deposit and an additional guarantee to  the   extent  of   10%  of  the aforesaid    amount.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(3) SCR 121 The following Order of the Court was delivered : We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant. In the instant case, according to the prosecution, 5940 gms. of heroin concealed in the bottom of a suitcase alleged to be belonging to the appellant was recovered when he was attempting to transport the same from the International Airport, Chennai to Singapore. The recovery memo was prepared on 5th January, 1987 at 3.00 A.M. and thereafter the appellant was arrested on that day at 2.00 P.M. The trial court acquitted the appellant by holding that mandatory provisions like Section 42 and Section 50 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short ""the NDPS Act"") had not been complied with. In appeal, the High Court reversed the decision of the trial court and convicted the appellant and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 1 lakh and in default to undergo RI for one month. In this appeal, it has been contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the provisions of Section 42 of the NDPS Act have not been complied with. He further states that there was delay in arresting the appellant which had not been explained and further that the provisions of Section 57 of the NDPS Act which are mandatory in nature have not been complied with. In the instant case, according to the documents on record and the evidence of the witnesses, the search and seizure took place at the Airport which is a public place. This being so, it is the provisions of Section 43 of the NDPS Act which would be applicable. Further, as Section 42 of the NDPS Act was not applicable in the present case, the seizure having been effected in a public place, the question of non-compliance, if any, of the provisions of Section 42 of the NDPS Act is wholly irrelevant. Furthermore, in the Mahazar which was prepared, it is clearly stated that the seizure was made by PW-1. The Mahazar was no doubt drawn by one S Jayanth. But, the contention of the learned senior counsel that prosecution version is vulnerable, because Jayanth has not been examined, is of no consequence because it is PW-1 who has conducted the seizure. With regard to the alleged non-compliance of Section 57 of the NDPS Act, the High Court has rightly noted that PW-3 has stated that the arrest of the accused was revealed to his immediate superior officer, namely, the Deputy Director. It was also contended by the learned senior counsel that the ground on which the appellant was arrested was not communicated to him. We find no merit in this because the arrest memo clearly indicates the offence stated to have been committed by the appellant under the NDPS Act. Further, the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 record also shows that copy of the arrest memo Exh. P-20 was received by the appellant. In the instant case, no search or seizure was conducted on the person of the accused and, therefore, the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act were not attracted. The High Court was, therefore, right in coming to the conclusion which it did. We do not find any merit in this appeal which is, accordingly, dismissed.","The trial court acquitted the appellant by holding that mandatory provisions like Section 42 and Section 50 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 had not been complied with.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition has been filed against the judgment and  order of  the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh made  in Second  Appeal No.333/96.  The  admitted position  is   that  the  petitioner  had  entered  Anto  an agreement on  June 14,  1986 for  sale of land admeasuring 6 Kanals 13  marlas for consideration of Rs.85,000/- per killa and received  Rs.6,000/- as earnest money and balance amount was agreed  to be paid on registration. The sale deed was to be executed by July 15, 1987. Since the petitioner failed to execute the  sale deed,  the respondent  filed the  suit for specific performance. All the courts below have concurrently found, as a fact, that respondent had presented a bank draft for the  balance consideration of Rs.64,000/- at the time of registration and  that the petitioner refused to receive the same. Bank  draft is  as good a payment of the consideration as cash.  The petitioner  committed breach of the conditions in the  performance of the contract. Accordingly, the decree for specific  performance was  granted. It  is contended for the petitioner  that payment  by way  of bank  draft is  not payment of  the consideration  by cash  at the  time of  the registration of  sale deed  by Sub-Registrar. Therefore, the petitioner committed  no breach of any part of the contract. On the other hand, the respondent-plaintiff committed breach of contract  in not paying cash consideration at the time of registration in  terms of  the agreement.  The courts  below have committed  manifest error  of law in decreeing the suit for specific  performance of  the contract. We find no force in the  contention. The  payment by  way of bank draft is as good a  payment as  cash-in-hand. Instead  of  bringing  the cash, he  had brought bank draft. Under these circumstances, the demand  for payment  of cash  by the petitioner would be had from the bank who would honour the same on behalf of the respondent. The  petitioner rightly presented the bank draft at the  time of  negotiation which  is legal  tender of cash payment to  the vendor/petitioner. The refusal for receiving http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 bank draft  at the  time of  registration of the petitioner, therefore, is  a breach  of the  covenant in  terms  of  the agreement. The  courts below have not committed any manifest error of  law to  decree the  suit for  specific performance warranting interference. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner had entered an agreement on June 14, 1986 for sale of land admeasuring 6 Kanals 13 marlas for consideration of Rs.85,000 per killa.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated April  15, 1993  of the  Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad made in RP No.5737/87. The appellant was appointed in  1951 as  a Copyist  in  the  Registration  and Stamps Department  in the erstwhile Government of Hyderabad. After formation  of Andhra Pradesh he was allotted to Andhra Pradesh services. By proceedings dated March 16, 1976 he was suspended from service. Though he was initially convicted by the Magistrate,  on appeal in Criminal Appeal No.581 of 1931 the High Court by judgment dated September 1, 1933 set aside the conviction  and acquitted  him of  all  the  charges  on merits. In  the meanwhile,  the appellant was dismissed from service on  July  16,  1981.  Consequently,  he  filed  R.P. NO.840/85. The Tribunal set aside the order and directed the Government to  consider his  case according  to rules. Since the appellant  had not passed the departmental tests, he was not considered  for promotion. He filed writ petition in the High Court in 1986 which directed the Government to consider his case.  He retired on attaining the age of superannuation on December  31, 1984.  Consequently, he  was entitled to be considered for promotion according to rules from the date on which his  immediate junior  was promoted with consequential benefits. It was found that the appellant had not passed the Registration test  and Accounts  test Part  and Part  II for Subordinate Officers  prescribed under  the  Special  Rules. Consequently, he  was not  given promotion.  Again when  the appellant  filed   R.P.  No.5737/87,  the  Tribunal  in  the impugned order  has dismissed the petition. Thus this appeal by special leave. It is  not in  dispute that  the Government have issued orders in  G.O.Ms. No.783 dated September 7, 1971 whereunder the Government  have directed  that first stage promotion be given to all the persons recruited under Hyderabad Cadre and Recruitment  Rules,   without  insisting  upon  passing  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 departmental tests  but gave  double the  time given  to the employees of Andhra Region for passing the tests. The matter was again examined in G.O. Ms. No.818 dated July 21, 1972 in consultation with  the team of Secretaries to the Government of India,  the State  Government reconsidered the matter and decided that  the employees  of the  erstwhile Government of Hyderabad allotted  to  the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  be permanently exempted  from passing the departmental tests on reaching the  age of  45 years for the second and subsequent stages of  promotion after November 1, 1956. The appellant’s date of  birth is October 1, 1928 and he attained the age of 45 years  as on  October 1,  1973.  In  view  of  the  above exemptions under the orders passed by the Government for the first  and   subsequent  promotion  he  is  entitled  to  be considered, without  insisting upon passing the departmental tests, for promotion on par with his immediate junior. Since he had  attained the  age of superannuation as on October 1, 1973,  he  is  entitled  to  be  considered  on  merits  for promotion without  passing  the  Accounts  and  Registration tests. Resultantly,  he was not required to pass any test at any  time   before  he   was  superannuated.   Under   those circumstances, the  view of  the Tribunal  is not correct in law. The order of the Tribunal is, therefore, set aside. The Government is  directed to  consider his  case according  to rules for  promotion without  insisting upon his passing the departmental tests  prescribed under  the Special  Rules  or General Rules and to pass appropriate orders within a period of three  months from  the date of receipt of the order with all consequential benefits. The appeal is allowed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from an order dated April 15, 1993 of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. The  appellant  is  challenging  his  conviction  under Section 7  read with  Section 16  of the  Prevention of Food Adulteration Act,  1955.

The  certificate  issued  by  the Public  Analyst   and  subsequently   by  the  Central  Food Laboratory show  that the  curd was  deficient in respect of milk fat  and milk  solids of  non fat.  We see no reason to differ from  the findings  recorded by both the courts below and, therefore,  the conviction  of the  appellant has to be confirmed. It  was  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant that Rules 4(3) and 4(4) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules were not complied with in this case. This contention has  been dealt with by the High Court and it has found that  they were complied with. Learned counsel was not able to  point out  how Rule 4(3) or Rule 4(4) have not been complied with  in this  case. His  submission that it is not mentioned in the certificate  that the sample was intact and therefore there  was non-compliance  does  not  deserve  any consideration because  there is  no requirement  that in the Certificate of  Analysis itself it should be stated that the sample when  received by  the Central  Food  Laboratory  was found intact. It was  also submitted  by the learned counsel that the offence had  taken place in 1979 and the appellant’s father, who was  the owner  of the shop has now died and, therefore, some leniency  should be shown to him. We cannot accept this submission because  once the  offence is  held  proved,  the minimum sentence has to be imposed. As  we  found  no  substance  in  this  appeal,  it  is dismissed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Admittedly, the  appellant is  handicapped  because  of colour blindness.  He was  admittedly selected by the Public Service Commission  but appointment  could not  be  made  on account of  his handicap.  When the  matter came up on March 27, 1995,  this Court  while issuing  notice passed order as follows:- ""Petitioner should  also give the nature of the duties he has to perform and whether his colour blindness would interfere with the discharge of his duties. Respondents  also would state in this behalf of their stand. If it is needed, they can also send the petitioner for medical examination by an expert Government Ophtholmogist or Board."" Despite the  order, the  Government took  no action  in that behalf.

On a  perusal of  the impugned  judgment  of  the  High Court, referring  to which learned counsel for the appellant pointed out  certain portions,  particularly in paras 13 and 18  including   the  operative  part  in  support  of  their submissions, we find that the judgment does not call for any interference.   We are  satisfied that the distinction drawn by the  High Court  between a ""Bandh"" and a call for general strike or  ""Hartal"" is  well made  out with reference to the effect of  a ""Bandh""  on the  fundamental  rights  of  other citizens.   There cannot  be any  doubt that the fundamental rights of the people as a whole cannot be subservient to the claim of  fundamental right  of a  n individual  or  only  a section of  the  people.    it  is  on  the  basis  of  this distinction that  the High  Court has rightly concluded that there cannot be any right to call or enforce a ""Bandh"" which interferes with  the exercise of the fundamental freedoms of other citizens,  in addition to causing national loss in may ways.   We may also add that the reasoning given by the High Court, particularly  those in  paragraphs 12,  13 and 17 for the ultimate  conclusion and  directions in  paragraph 18 is correct with which we are in agreement.

" O R D E R Leave granted.

No case of contempt arises  against respondents  Nos.1 to 4. Though 6th respondent was  served with  the notice  directing him to be present, he  was not  present. Had  we been  informed at the beginning, we  would have  taken appropriate  steps for  his presence by  non-bailable warrants.  But at  the end  of the arguments, we  were informed  of it. We strongly condemn his conduct as unbecoming of a responsible citizen. However, these  facts which  emerged at the hearing are relevant facts  to be considered for the purpose of disposal of the  writ petition  on merits. Since the writ petition is pending, we  decline to express any opinion on the facts and circumstances  and  on  merits.  The  contempt  petition  is accordingly dismissed. However, the  High Court is requested to dispose of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible preferably within six months from the date of receipt of this order.

" J U D G M E N T (with Criminal Appeal No. 1605 of 2005) MARKANDEY KATJU, J. These appeals have been filed against the impugned judgment and order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 24.10.2002 in Criminal Appeal No. 616-DB of 2001. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The trial court by its judgment dated 18.10.2001 convicted accused Resham Pal Singh and sentenced him to death under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, but the High Court while affirming the conviction has reduced the sentence to life imprisonment.   The High Court has further directed the appellant to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000/- and in default to undergo further RI for a period of one year for the offence under Section 302 IPC. The High Court also maintained the sentence of imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- awarded under Section 307 IPC.  In default of payment of fine the appellant had to undergo further RI for a period of two months.  The amount of fine of Rs. 50,000/-, if realized from the appellant was directed to be paid to Harpreet Singh, who has lost his parents. In these two appeals the prayer was to enhance the punishment to death sentence. We have gone through the evidence and have considered the facts of the case. In our opinion, there is no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court.  The question of sentence has been considered by the High Court in detail in paragraph 36 of its judgment and, therefore, we see no reason to differ from the view taken by the High Court.  Hence, both the appeals are dismissed and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court stands upheld.","The trial court by its judgment dated 18.10.2001 convicted accused Resham Pal Singh and sentenced him to death under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court allowing the writ petition filed by the respondent and dismissing the review petition filed by the present appellant. 2.      The factual scenario need not be referred to in detail.  In a nutshell the position is as follows: Respondent aggrieved by an award of the Labour Court dated 20.2.2003 filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short ’Constitution’).  The dispute which was referred to before the Labour Court for adjudication read as follows: ""Whether termination of services by the employers of their workman Shri Vinod Kumar, S/o Shri Shiv Charan Lal, Mandi Assistant w.e.f. 10.01.1998 is legal and/or valid?  If not, then to what relief or benefit the workman is entitled to get?"" 3.      The Labour Court after issuance of the notice to the parties held that the Subzi Mandi was not an industry and further the workman had been appointed for 89 days on ad hoc basis.  The said award was challenged before the High Court.  The matter was listed on 27.8.2003 for the first time and on that date the judgment was reserved and delivered on 19.12.2003. 4.      According to learned counsel for the appellants the notice was given on 23.8.2003 and the matter was listed on 27.8.2003.  Though the judgment was purportedly delivered on 19.12.2003, same was not in the list.  The parties were not aware of the judgment delivered which is evident from the fact that the counter affidavit was filed by the present appellant on 16.1.2004 and the rejoinder by the present respondent was filed on 29.4.2004.  It is, therefore, submitted that without issuance of the notice, on the first day itself the judgment was reserved and the award of the Labour Court was set aside.

" J U D G M E N T B.P.SINGH, J. We have heard counsel for the State. This appeal has been preferred by the State of Rajasthan against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur in Criminal Appeal No.392 of 1996 dated May 6, 1998. The Respondent who had been found guilty of the offence under Section 8 read with Section 15 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1 lakh by the learned Special Judge, N.D.P.S.Cases, ...2/- -2- Sri Ganganagar in Sessions Case No.15 of 1995. The Respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court which was allowed by the High Court by its impugned judgment and order. We have perused the judgment of the High Court. Apart from other reasons recorded by the High Court, we find that the link evidence adduced by the prosecution was not at all satisfactory. In the first instance, though the seized articles are said to have been kept in the malkhana on 20th May, 1995, the Malkhana register was not produced to prove that it was so kept in the malkhana till it was taken over by PW-6 on June 5, 1995. We further find that no sample of the seal was sent along with the sample to Excise Laboratory, Jodhpur for the purpose of comparing with the seal appearing on the sample bottles. Therefore, there is no evidence to prove satisfactorily that the seals found were in fact the same seals as were put on the sample bottles immediately after seizure of the contraband. These loopholes in the prosecution case have led the High Court to acquit the respondent. ...3/- -3- We find no error in the judgment of the High Court. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.","This appeal has been preferred by the State of Rajasthan against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the learned counsel on both sides. The only  question for  consideration  is:  Doordarshan Kendra, Trivandrum  that he  would not  claim his  seniority held in Salem w.e.f. August 19, 1984. Shri E.M.S.  Anam, learned  counsel for  the  appellant contended that since the transfer had come to be made due to administrative exigencies,  viz., abolition  of the post and creation of  the post  and availability  of the  vacancy  in Tamil Nadu,  the transfer  was not on account of the request made by the appellant and that, therefore, the seniority had to be  reckoned from  the date  of his  initial appointment, i.e.,  September   21,  1983.   We  find  no  force  in  the contention. It is  now settled  legal position that on abolition of the post, the holder of the post has no right to continue on the  post.  Instead  of  retrenching  him  as  surplus,  the Government have  accommodated him  in the  available vacancy and, therefore,  it must be deemed to be a fresh appointment for the  purposes of  seniority. After  joining in  Salem in Tamil Nadu, he made a request for transfer to Trivandrum and it is  at his request that he was transferred. Consequently, on his  undertaking in  the application  that he  would  not claim his  seniority at  Salem  Station,  the  transfer  was effected at  his request.  It is settled legal position that he  would  take  his  seniority  as  junior-most  among  the confirmed employees in the transferee-region. Considered from  this perspective,  we are  of the view that the  Tribunal  has  not  committed  any  error  of  law warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated 22.7.1994  of the  Division  Bench  of  the  Punjab  & Haryana  High  Court  in  Writ  Petition  No.  3843/94.  The admitted facts  are that  Regulation  6  of  the  Chandigarh Housing Board  (Allotment,Management and  Sale of Tenements) Regulations, 1979  (for short,‘the  Regulations’) regulates, among  other  things,  allotment  of  the  buildings/  flats constructed by  the appellant-Board.  A wife/husband and the unmarried children  or other  members of  the  family,  one, among  them,   alone  is   eligible  for  allotment  of  any building/flat. When  the notification was published inviting applications for  allotment of  Category II  flats, the  1st respondent as well as his wife, Mrs. Kuldip Kaur, separately applied for  allotment of two houses. The allotments came to be made  independently,but later  on it  was discovered that both of  them being  wife and  husband, were  not eligible . Consequently, the  allotment made  to the 1st respondent was cancelled and the amount paid by him was forfeited under the Regulations. When he filed the writ petition, the High Court in the impugned order directed the appellant-Board to return the entire  money paid  by the  1st respondent or adjust the same towards  the amount  payable by  his  wife.  Thus  this appeal by special leave. In the  counter-affidavit filed  by the 1st respondent, it is  admitted that  acceptance of  allotment by  both, the wife and  husband was a mistake but there was no prohibition for making  an application  for allotment  at  the  relevant time. Since  the 1st  respondent and his wife were estranged and  were   living  separately,   they  came   to  make  the applications   separately    and   subsequently    due    to reconcilement they  have  been  living  together  and  that, therefore,  there   is  no   illegality  in   their   making applications as none of them was then owing a house and that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the High Court was right in directing to refund the amount. Having considered  the facts and circumstances, we find that  when   the     Regulations   prohibit   allotment   to wife/husband or dependants and if any one has got a house or a flat,  by necessary  implication both  or all  except  one among the  members  of  the  unit  are  ineligible  to  make separate applications.  There need  not be any specific rule prohibiting making  separate application in that behalf.  So long as the couple are tied by marriage bond, both are bound by the Regulations for allotment. Therefore,the cancellation per se  is not  illegal. The  question then  is whether  the entire amount  should be  forfeited. Obviously, the power of forfeiture was  intended to prevent fraud and malpractice in allotment and  in case  of positive  finding in that behalf, courts would  be loath to interfere with the exercise of the power under Regulation 6 (2). On the  facts and  circumstances in this case, we think that the  appellant- Board  would be justified in forfeiting half of  the amount  deposited by the 1st respondent and the balance amount may be adjusted towards the amount payable by his wife,  if not  already paid.  This may  not, however, be treated as a precedent. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the order dated 22.7.1994 of the Division  Bench of the Punjab  & Haryana High Court.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court allowing the second appeal filed by the respondent under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short \021CPC\022).  The respondent no.1 had filed a suit in respect of 3 acres 22 guntas of land in Survey no.393/Aa (Paiki) situated in Yadgir-B, Taluk Yadgir. Plaintiff claimed property to be ancestral property. 2.      The defendants resisted the suit contending that the suit land being shown as \021Sega Local Fund\022 property since 1954, it is the property belonging to the Town Municipal Council, Vadgir as such it has every right to deal with in accordance with the Municipal Laws and that the plaintiff cannot prevent lawful action of the defendants by way of such suit. It was further contended that the plaintiff if not at all in possession of the suit land and that they have issued notification as required under the Municipal Law to provide sites to houseless persons and the plaintiff, winning over the village Accountant, got his name entered in the column of cultivator without any right and, therefore, the suit of the plaintiff is not at all maintainable. With these contentions, the defendants prayed for dismissal of the suit. 3.      The Trial Court framed the issues and came to hold that under Section 284(1) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, (in short the \021Act\022) previous notice for the suits is mandatory and there was no compliance with the said requirement and, therefore, the suit was liable to be dismissed in limine.  It was also pointed out that entry in the Khasra Pahani and R.O.R. right from 1954-55 indicated the suit land as \023Sega Local Fund\024 and the same was not challenged by the plaintiff or his ancestors. 4.      The Trial Court and the First Appellate Court found that there was no merit in the suit and accordingly the suit was dismissed by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court upheld it. The High Court, as noted above, reversed the findings and allowed the second appeal. 5.      At the outset it is to be indicated that the Second Appeal was allowed without framing a question of law which is clearly contrary to the mandate of Section 100. This position has http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 been highlighted in several decisions. (See Gian Dass v. Panchayat, Village Sunner Kalan & Ors.

Bahadur Ram and Ors. (JT 2004 (6) SC 296) and Kanhaiyalal v. Anupkumar (JT 2002 (10) SC 98). 6.      Apart from that it is noted that the judgment of the learned Single Judge is practically non-reasoned. The High Court in second appeal interfered with the findings of facts. Therefore, since the judgment is practically non-reasoned, it is not possible to find out as to what weighed with the High Court to upset the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court.

" Nanavati. J. The appellant has been convicted under Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act by the Designated Court,  Bhiwani  as  he  was  found  in  possession   of   a countrymade 315 bore pistol and a live cartidge. The Designated Court relying upon  the  evidence  of P.W.2  - Ganga Ram held that the allegation made against the appellant was proved and he was infect found  in  possession of a  pistol and a live cartidge.  The Designated Court also relied upon the report of Forensic  Science  Laboratory  and held that the pistol was in a working condition. What  is  contended  by  the learned counsel for the appellant is that the Designated Court failed to  appreciate that the evidence of Ganga Ram was so improbable that it did not deserve to be accepted.  As disclosed by the prosecution evidence,  a  space was registered against the appellant and seven others for the offence of murder on November  1,  1988 at Fatehabad Police Station.  The police was on look out for the appellant.     On  8th  November,  1988,  the  appellant accompanied by his maternal uncle presented  himself  before the Officer  incharge  of the Fatehabad Police Station.  SHO Ganga Ram took him in custody and at that  time  found  from his possession,  a  pistol  and  a cartidge.  No independent witness was kept present at the time of  either  taking  the appellant  into  custody or while seizing the pistol and the cartidge.  The reason given by Ganga Ram in this  behalf  is the  because his maternal uncle was present he did not think it fit to call bay other person to witness  the  seizure  of the weapon  and  the  cartidge.    This  obviously is a lame excuse.  In absence of any independent evidence, seizure  of a  pistol  and  a  cartidge from possession of the appellant becomes doubtful.    It  is  also  highly   improbable   the appellant  had  presented  himself  with  a weapon which was unlicensed.  He had not gone there to make a confession.  He had gone to the police station because he was wanted by  the police in  that  case.  No other witness was examined by the prosecution on the point of  recovery  of  a  pistol  and  a cartidge from  the  possession  of  the  appellant.   As the evidence of Ganga Ram does not appear to  be  truthful,  the conviction of the appellant will have to be set aside.

O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Baba Mungipa  Education Trust,  sought to  establish  a Medical College  in Tripura.   According to the trust, there was no  Medical College  in Tripura  and the  Trust tried to meet a  long felt  need in  that State.  It applied  to  the Central Government  for permission  to set up the College as required by  the Indian  Medical Council  Act, on 1.11.1994. No action  was taken  on this application.  Aggrieved by the inaction of  the Central  Government, the trust took various legal proceedings  Ultimately by  an order  dated 21.7.1995, this  Court   directed  the   Central  Government   to  take expeditious steps  for processing  of  the  application  and disposing it  of in accordance with law in consultation with the Medical Council of India. From  time   to  time,   this  Court  has  given  other directions.  The trust was successful in its effort to get a provisional affiliation  of the College from the University. It has  been stated on behalf of the Trust that they had set up the  College and  admitted students  to  the  first  year class.   But after some time, because of the inaction by the University and  the Central  Government, classes  had to  be suspended. It is not disputed that no classes have been held for several years now. The case of the Trust is that there is no reason not to grant recognition to this college,  Some deficiencies in the facilities to  be provided by the College have been noted by the Medical  Council of  India.  Those defects will be cured once the   College  gets recognition.  If the College is not recognised by  the Medical  Council, the  students who  have already been  admitted will be seriously prejudiced.  It has been prayed  on behalf of the students also that the Medical Council of  India should be directed to grant recognition to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the College set up the Trust. An inspection was carried out by the Medical Council on the direction  given by  this Court  on 28th  July, 1997.  A copy of  the Inspection Report has been filed in this Court. It appears  from the  Report that  the said  inspection  was carried out  by a  team of  doctors deputed  by the  Medical Council of  India on  23rd and  24th September,  1997.   The Report noted  various deficiencies  in the College,  It also noted that  the College  does not have a proper building and has not yet acquired the land to construct the building.  On behalf of  the College  authorities, it has been stated that the land is expected to be given by the Government very soon and construction will start immediately. We are  of the  view that  until and unless the defects pointed out by the Medical council are removed, there cannot be any question of granting recognition to the College.  The College authorities  will be  entitled to  cure the  defects pointed out  in the  Report.  After curing the defects, they may apply  o the  Medical Council  for a further inspection. It is for the Medical Council of India to decide whether the College had  all the facilities for imparting proper medical education.   But on  the facts brought out in the Report, no direction can  be given  to the  Medical Council of India or the Union of India to take any step for granting recognition to the  College.   Admission of  first year  students to the College even  before grant of the recognition by the Medical Council of India or affiliation by the University was a very irresponsible step.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent had submitted before us that they shall hand over two shop rooms,   namely,    Shop No. 6 & 7 Balaji Market, Main Road, Tundla (U.P.)                                 to  the  petitioners within a period of  two                          weeks from this date.

In the event, possession of two shop rooms are not delivered or taken possession of, it will be open to the respondent to execute the decree in accordance with law and this special leave petition shall stand dismissed.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted.  He have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. Admittedly, the  appellant was  appointed as Vaccinator in a  Small Pox  Eradication Programme  on May  6, 1975. The scheme was  disbanded in  1985. Thereafter,  a decision  was taken on  November 14,  1986 to retain 25 per cent of senior officers  and  to  absorb  the  remaining  75  per  cent  in equivalent posts  in regular  cadres. In  consequence, while awaiting his absorption, the appellant filed CWJC No.2412/90 for a  direction to consider his case. Accordingly, the High Court by  order dated  January 22, 1991 directed the Medical Officer to  consider his  case. A representation was made by the appellant  to consider  him for  promotion as  a  clerk. Consequently, the  District Medical  Officer promoted him on May 7, 1991 as a clerk and he joined as such on May 9, 1991. The District  Medical Officer  had stated  in the  letter of appointment that  his promotion  would  be  subject  to  the confirmation by the Director-in-Chief. The Director-in-Chief in his proceedings dated December 10, 1992  cancelled the appointment following the Resolution No.2215 dated  February 11,  1985. It  was stated there that any promotion  made  would  be  subject  to  the  policy  of confirmation  according   to  the  rules  on  the  basis  of seniority-cum-fitness   and    also   observing    rule   of reservation. Since  the appointment of the appellant was not made in  pursuance of  the resolution,  it was observed that the appellant  was not  properly appointed as clerk. When he filed the  CWJC No.13022/92,  by its order dated February 2, 1993 the High Court dismissed the same and a review petition filed subsequently  was also  dismissed on  January 4, 1994. Thus this appeal by special leave. Though the  learned councel for the appellant contended that the District Medical Officer is the competent authority http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to appoint  a clerk, he is required to follow the principles laid down in Resolution No.2215 dated February 11,1985, even if he  be the appointing authority. Indisputably, he did not follow the  procedure. The  appellant was really required to be absorbed in an equivalent post because he was found to be a  surplus  Vaccinator.  The  equivalent  post  is  that  of Vaccinator in  other departments. Therefore, on the basis of his order  in the merit of surplus employees, he is required to be  absorbed. As  soon as  his turn  comes, the competent authority is  directed to  absorb him.  On  his  absorption, according to  the said resolution and the entitlement on per with other  candidates, his  case would  be  considered  for promotion as  clerk. Since  the appellant has already worked from May  8, 1991  till December  10, 1992  as clerk,  he is entitled to  salary attached  to the  post of  clerk for the said period. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed to the above extent but, in the circumstances, without costs.","Admittedly, the appellant was appointed as Vaccinator in a Small Pox  Eradication Programme on May 6, 1975.

" S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Heard parties. L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J This  Appeal is against an Order dated 12th April, 2000, by  which a Detention Order dated 12th August, 1999 has been quashed.  The Detention Order has been quashed on the ground that  there has been non-application of mind on the part  of the  Detaining Authority.  This conclusion was arrived at by holding  that  page  19 of the Recovery  Mahazar  shows  two separate sample bottles each containing 600 mls.  of arrack, whereas  page 45 of the Chemical Examiner’s Report shows 550 mls.   of arrack.  We have been shown and looked at page  19 of  the  Recovery  Mahazar  and  page  45  of  the  Chemical Examiner’s  Report.   They  do not both relate to  the  same case.   Page 19 relates to this case but page 45 relates  to some  other case.  Mr.  Lambat fairly admitted that the  two do  not  relate  to the same case.  From the  above,  it  is apparent  that  the  High  Court  materially  erred  in  not considering these facts before quashing the detention order. In  this  view of the matter, the impugned Order  cannot  be sustained and it is accordingly set aside. However,  the Detention Order was of 1999.  The same had been quashed by the High Court in April 2000.  The period of detention  is  over.  In our view, this is not a case  where the  Detenu  should  be  made to surrender  to  undergo  the remaining period of detention. The  Appeal stands disposed off accordingly.

" JUDGMENT ASHOK BHAN, J. 1. Being aggrieved by the order dated 10 th September 2001 passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (Now known as Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal) [for short ‘the Tribunal] in Appeal No.E-294/2001, the assessee-appellant has filed the present appeal. 2. The appellant purchased ‘Loadall’ from M/s. Escorts JCB Ltd. The cost element of the ‘Loadall’ included excise duty to the tune of Rs.1,79,328/-. The appellant claimed MODVAT credit in respect of the said item under Rule 57Q of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 (for short, ‘the Rules’). 3. Since the said item had been classified by M/s. Escorts JCB Ltd., the manufacturer and supplier, under Heading 84.29 and had paid duty under the said heading, the authority-in-original, viz., Dy. Commissioner disallowed the MODVAT credit to the appellant by observing that the said Heading 84.29 has been specifically ousted from the definition of ""capital goods"" under Rule 57Q of the Rules. The Dy. Commissioner also imposed a penalty of Rs.50,000/- under Rule 173Q(bb) of the Rules. 4. On appeal filed by the appellant, the Commissioner (Appeals) observed that ‘Loadall’ being an improvised version of material handling equipment would properly fall under Heading 84.27 and not under Heading 84.29. It was further observed that forklift truck or crane or similar material handling equipments have been held to be eligible capital goods. On this finding, the Commissioner (Appeals) held that the appellant would be entitled to claim MODVAT credit. 5. Revenue, being aggrieved, filed an appeal before the Tribunal which was accepted by setting aside the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) and restoring that of the authority-in-original. It was held that the ‘Loadall’ having been classified by the Central Excise Officer having jurisdiction over the manufacturer’s factory as falling under Heading 84.29, the appellant, who is the consumer of those goods, could not get the classification of the manufacturer changed from 84.29 to 84.27. 6. The finding recorded by the Tribunal is unexceptionable. We agree with the view taken by the Tribunal that the appellant could not get the classification of ‘Loadall’ changed to Heading 84.27 from 84.29, as declared by the manufacturer. Insofar as the penalty imposed by the authority-in-original is concerned, we are of the view that a case for imposition of penalty is not made out and accordingly the same is set aside and deleted. Rest of the order of the Tribunal restoring the order of the authority-in-original is confirmed. 7. Counsel for the appellant has raised an alternate argument on the interpretation of Rule 57Q of the Rules which had not been raised either in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reply to the show cause notice or before any of the authorities below. Under the circumstances, we do not permit the appellant to raise this alternate submission. 8. The appeal is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.","The appellant claimed MODVAT credit in respect of the said item under Rule 57Q of the Central Excise Rules, 1944.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court while dealing with an application for bail filed by the respondent who was named in the First Information Report (in short the ’FIR’) as an accused alleging commission of offence punishable under Sections 363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’) and Section 3(2) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention  of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (in short the ’SCST Act’). The prayer was for release of the respondent on bail.  Although there was no allegation of any improper investigation, the High Court started monitoring the case at different points of time and passed various orders. Ultimately, it passed the impugned order where serious criticism was leveled against the State Government and police officials. It was stated that the police officials are not doing proper investigation in many cases as they were engaged for other unimportant work. It was noted that many times grievance was made by senior police officers that the Court is too lenient in granting bail to criminals.  It was, however, held that the State Government had failed to check the crime situation in the State and the State Government was warned to take serious action against criminals and to control the crime situation expeditiously.  It was stated that senior officers in the Government of Uttar Pradesh were being repeatedly summoned to cast upon failure to comply with the orders of the High Court efficaciously. Direction was given to recover the missing girl within a stipulated time and to submit periodic report. 2.      Grievance of the appellant is that there was no lapse noticed by the High Court in the investigation.  The general and sweeping observations are uncalled for and are without any foundation.  It is pointed out that the girl was traced out. She is married since 2004. Bail was granted to the respondent on 22.5.2002.  The trial is in progress and the girl’s statement has already been recorded and for recording further evidence the matter is posted on 30th June, 2007.  Learned counsel for the respondent-accused does not dispute this position. 3.      This Court has repeatedly held that observations which are really unnecessary for disposal of a case should not be made.  A bare reading of the High Court’s order shows that general and sweeping observations were made without http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 indicating any basis therefor. When there was no allegation by anybody about any lapse in the investigation and, in fact, the High Court’s judgments does not indicate any infirmity in the investigation, there was no necessity for casting aspersion on the bona fides of the police officials and for making serious criticisms. 4.      This appeal is disposed of directing deletion of the observations and criticisms made by the High Court vis a vis the Government and its officials.  They were really unnecessary.",The appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court while dealing with an application for bail filed by the respondent.

" L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J J U D G M E N T RAJENDRA BABU, J.  : In these matters we are concerned with I.A.  Nos.  7-9 of  1999 in Civil Appeals Nos.  2987-2989 of 1997.  In these applications  common relief sought for by the applicants  is that  they are also covered by the judgment dated 06.12.1996 and the consequent orders made on 11.04.1997 passed in these appeals.   The workmen in respect of whom these applications are   made  are  Sweepers  in   the  Parking  Areas  in  the International  Airport and National Airport.  Civil  Appeals Nos.   2987-2989  of  1997  were disposed  of  on  11.4.1997 holding  that on the abolition of the contract labour system Sweepers  in such Airports are entitled to be regularised in service   as  indicated  therein.    The  cause  for   these applications  is  that  the respondents are  contesting  the entitlement of the applicants for regularisation in service. The  stand  of the respondents is that these applicants  are Sweepers employed in the parking areas of the Airports which does  not  form  part of the building and  the  notification dated  December  9,  1976  does  not  cover  such  employees inasmuch  as the said notification has prohibited employment of  contract  labour  for sweeping,  cleaning,  dusting  and watching of building owned or occupied by the establishment. Further objection to the claim of the applicants is that the Parking  Areas are allotted to different contractors who are obliged  to keep areas clean.  The Sweepers with whom we are concerned  in  these interlocutory applications work in  the car  parks in the Santacruz and Sahar Airports at Mumbai and they  are six in number.  It is difficult to conceive of the airport being functional without a car park and that the car park  is  not a part of the building.  The Airport  includes not only landing and taking off areas for the aircrafts, the run  ways and aircraft maintenance areas, but also passenger facilities.   Passenger  facilities would certainly  include car  parking and it cannot be said that car parking is not a part  of the building.  Building in its ordinary sense would http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 include  appurtenances which form thereof unless it be  that expression  building  is  to be understood as  was  done  by Merchant  of  Venice  with  reference  to  pound  of  flesh. Therefore,   we  cannot  agree  with   the  stand   of   the respondents.   Next objection is that there is an  agreement with  the  contractors who are to maintain the  car  parking areas  and  they  have  an  obligation  to  maintain  proper cleanliness  in the car parking areas and the expenditure in regard  to  the same will have to be borne by the  licensee. Inasmuch  as  the  notification issued  under  the  Contract Labour  (Abolition  &  Regulation)   Act,  1970  covers  the Sweepers  employed in respect of buildings owned or occupied by  the  establishment,  it is unnecessary to  examine  this aspect  of  the matter.  Inevitable conclusion is  that  the judgment  rendered in Civil Appeals Nos.  2987-2989 of  1997 following  the decisions in Air India Statutory  Corporation etc.   v.  United Labour Union & Ors., etc., 1996 (9)  SCALE 70,  and Masih Charan & Ors.  v.  Union of India & Ors.   in Writ Petition (C ) No.  219 of 1995 dated March 10, 1997, is applicable to these workmen also.

Bansal for the Appellants. K.C.  Bajaj, Ms. Kusum Chaudhary and Y.K. Jain  for  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Respondent. The following Order of the Court was delivered: Special leave granted. We  have heard learned counsel for both the parties  and also  considered the order passed by the High Court.  Admit- tedly,  these two appellants were appointed much earlier  to the  appointment of respondent Nos. 3 and 4 in the  post  of Assistant  Sub-Inspector of Police. Their appointment  being on 30.3.71 and 24.4.71 whereas the appointment of respondent Nos. 3 and 4 were on 18.2.83. They were promoted in 1983  as Assistant  Sub-Inspectors  of Police. On  1.1.89  respondent Nos.  3  and 4 and appellant Nos.1 and 2  were  promoted  as Inspectors  of  Police  and a composite  Seniority  List  of appellants,  respondent  Nos. 3 and 4  and  other  similarly appointed  persons was issued by respondent No. 1  in  which appellant No- 1 was shown at serial No. 33, appellant No.  2 at  serial  No. 34 and the respondent Nos. 3 and 4  were  at serial numbers 46 and 47 respectively. On 16.10.89 by  order of  respondent Nos. 1 and 2, State of Haryana  and  Director General of Police respondent No. 3 was promoted out of  turn as  Deputy Superintendent of Police. On 23.10.89  respondent No.  4 was promoted as Deputy Superintendent of Police,  out of turn. It is rather curious that not a single whisper  was there  in the order of promotion why the said, out of  turn, promotion was given. It was tried to be contended by learned counsels  on behalf of respondent Nos. 3 and 4 that  because of  their  gallantry this out of turn promotion  was  given. However,  there  is  no whisper about this  in  the  letters giving  promotion. The appellants, on the other  hand,  were promoted as Deputy Superintendents of Police as on  11.1.90. While  filing the Writ Petition before the High  Court,  the appellants stated that they came to know of this out of turn promotion sometime on 3.8.90. We  have considered the order of the High Court.  It  is really  a  matter of great regret that  inspite  of  several pronouncements  of this Court that the order dismissing  the writ  petition must be a speaking order in order  to  enable the  persons  affected to know what were the  reasons  which weighed with the High Court in dismissing the writ petition.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. Heard learned counsel on both sides. Notification  under   Section  4   (1)  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894  [for  short,  the  ’Act""]  was  last published on April 10, 1989 acquiring a large extent of land admeasuring  8,61,515  sq.mtr.  for  public  purpose,  viz., industrial development;  the land  was at  that time fit for cultivation  but   possessed  of  potential  value  and  was situated in outskirts of Surat. The Land Acquisition Officer in his  award dated  April 15,  1991 awarded  compensation @ Rs.5/- per  sq.mtr. On  reference, the extra Assistant Judge by his  award and  decree dated  April 19, 1994 enhanced the compensation to  Rs.25/- per  sq.mtr. On  appeal by both the claimants as  well  as  the  State,  the  High  Court  while dismissing the  appeals of  the State  further enhanced  the compensation to  Rs.33/- per  sg.mtr. Thus  these appeals by special leave. Though the  land was  waste land but being possessed of potent value  was fit  for building purposes and is situated in outskirts of industrial city, the courts below were right in taking into consideration potential value of the land for determination of  compensation. In awards for lands notified under Section  4(1) published  between December 15, 1986 and December 29,  1989, compensation was awarded in the range of Rs. 4.75 per sq.mtr. to Rs. 7/per sq.mtr. In respect of land situated in lchhapur to a extent of around 908 sq. mtr., the market value  was in  the range of Rs.33 per sq.mtr. Relying upon that, the High Court enhanced the compensation. In view of the fact that the lands are situated at a distance of two kilometers from  the acquired  lands reliance  on sale deed, Ex.22 by the High Court was wholly unjustified in law. It is accordingly excluded.  However, we  agree that the lands are possessed of  potential value,  as found  by all  the courts below. No prudent  purchaser would  purchase large  extent  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 land on  the basis  of sale of a small extent of land in the open market.  The acid test the court should always adopt in determining  market   value  in  the  matter  of  compulsory acquisition would  be to  eschew feats of imagination sit in the arm  chair of  a prudent  willing purchaser,  it  should consider whether  the willing  vendee would  offer the  rate which  the   trial   court   proposes   to   determine   the compensation. Taking  these facts into consideration, we are of the  view that  the reasonable  and adequate compensation for the  lands would  be at net rate of Rs.22/- per sq.mtr., after giving  deduction  of  1/3rd  of  the  amount  towards developmental chargers.  Therefore, the  claimants would  be entitled to the compensation @ Rs. 22/- per sq.mtr. They are also entitled  to the  statutory benefits  on  the  enhanced compensation.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP ) No.13900 of 2003) S. N. VARIAVA, J. Delay condoned. Special leave granted. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not placed in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 2724 in Sector 23/23A (II), Gurgaon, on 11th August 1986.

We are told that possession has already been offered on 17th March 1997 and interest @ 12% has been paid.

" JUDGMENT 2000 Supp(2) SCR 708 The following Order of the Court was delivered : In the order passed by this Court on 17.1.2000 dismissing the SLP by a reasoned order, this Court held that, notwithstanding the fact that a vesting order was passed under the provisions of the (Urban Land Ceiling & Regula-tion) Act, 1976, it would be open to the owner of the land whose land had so vested, to seek exemption under the provisions of the Act. In the facts of that case, the G.O. issued by the Government granting exemption was issued on 31.10.88 subsequent to the order of vesting on 5.10.87 notice for surrender was issued by the Government on 16.4.88 and G.O. Granting exemption was issued on 31.10.1988 Learned Single Judge and the Division Bench held that the G.O. could be taken advantage of by the respondent even though vesting order had been passed. This order was upheld by this Court against the judgment dated 17.1.2000 mentioned above. The present application for clarification has been filed by the State of Andhra Pradesh for clarifying the position as to whether if possession had not been taken, pursuant to the order of vesting, the owner of the land had a right to seek exemption from the provisions of the Act under Section 20 or under Section 10, by virtue of the G.O. issued by the Government. It will be noticed that in order of the Division Bench of the High Court, this position has been clearly explained. The Bench said that ""the question of retrospectivity of the exemption order does not really arise for the reason that in the proceedings under Chapter III of the Act are still pending, may be set the final stage"". The Division Bench further observed that : ""Be that as it may, in the present case, the exemption order which is of general nature is under Section 20(1 )(a), and it was issued after the vesting order under Sec. 10(3) of the Act was published. That the exemption could be granted even after vesting, being the proposition definitely laid down by the Supreme Court and this Court, there is no reason why such exemption shall not have the effect of taking the land out of the purview of the Act so long as the proceedings under the Chapter III have not been concluded in their entirety"". The Division Bench further observed as follows : ""This is yet another consideration, which weighs with the Court to hold that the exemption granted under G.O. 733 will be attracted to any excess land in respect of which at least the proceedings under Chapter III have not yet come to an end."" We fully endorse the view expressed by the Division Bench of the High Court as extracted above. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We are, however, not deciding a situation where possession has been taken over and where third party rights have not intervened. With the above clarification, the I.A. is disposed of.","The State of Andhra Pradesh filed an application for clarification. The application asked if the owner of the land had a right to seek exemption from the provisions of the Act under Section 20 or under Section 10.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1726 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 6984 of 2006) Leave granted. Landlord is in appeal. Respondents-claimants were employed as agricultural labourers  at the rate of Rs.80 per day or one-fifth share with the appellant from 01.05.2002 to 30.04.2003. They filed a claim petition before the Competent Authority under the Minimum Wages Payment Act, 1948 (for short ’the  Act’) alleging that they were paid wages less than Rs.80 per day or one-fifth share in agricultural employment, as agreed upon; that as per the calculati on on the basis of the Act they were entitled to recover  Rs.85,168.32P from the appellant. Appellant filed his written statement wherein it was stated that the provisions of t he Act were not applicable as the respondents were not working as labourers but had taken up the agricultural work on the basis of one-fifth share in crop. On 07.04.2005, the Competent Authority ordered to proceed ex-parte  against  the appellant  since he did not appear before the - 2 - Competent Authority.  On 14.06.2005, the Competent Authority allowed the respondents application and directed the appellant to deposit Rs.85,168/- within 30 days from the date o f the order failing which appellant shall pay one time of this amount as compensation. Appellant filed an application before the Competent Authority for setting aside the order dated 07.04.2005 by which he was proceeded ex-parte and order dated 14.06.2005 by which the award of Rs.85,168/- was passed. The said application was dismissed by the Competent Authority on 28.06.2005. Thereafter, appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh seeking setting aside of the aforesaid orders which has been dismissed by the impugned order. Hence, this appeal by grant of special leave. This court on 28.04.2006, while issuing notice, directed the appellant to deposit Rs.85,168/- before the Competent Authority within a period of two weeks from the date of the order. By order dated 05.09.2007, this court extended the time to deposit the aforesaid amount within a period of four weeks from the said date. This is an admitted position that appellant has deposited the amount which has been withdrawn by the respondents-claimants. Counsel for the appellant states that since the amount of Rs.85,168/- has already be en withdrawn by the respondents-claimants, this appeal has become infructuous and may be dismissed as such. On the other  hand, counsel for the respondents-claimants - 3 - has urged before us that since the appellant had not deposited the aforesaid amount within t http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 he time granted by this Court, claimants are entitled to more compensation. We do not find any substance in the argument raised by the counsel for the claimants. It is made clear that the amount of Rs.85,168/- shall be in full and final settlement of the wages due. No additional amount in default is required to be paid. Delay, if any, in depositing the said amount is condoned. The appeal is dismissed accordingly.","Respondents-claimants were employed as agricultural labourers at the rate of Rs.80 per day or one-fifth share with the appellant from 01.05.2002 to 30.04.2003.

It is stated in the petition that the petitioner’s company is carrying on the business of manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products, having its registered office at Delhi.  It is further alleged that the petitioner’s company sold some of its products to the respondent in connection with which the respondent issued a cheque dated 5.12.2002 in favour of the petitioner.  That cheque was presented by the petitioner to its bank being Punjab National Bank, Connaught Place, New Delhi, but the same was dishonoured.  Hence, a criminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi, which is pending before the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. 4.      It is alleged that subsequently the respondent has filed a private complaint dated 18.8.2004 under Sections 420/465/467/471/468 & 120-B IPC before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhatinda, Punjab against the Managing Director and General Manager (Marketing) of the petitioner’s company, and on that complaint the Bhatinda Court summoned the Managing Director and General Manager (Marketing) of the petitioner’s company vide its order dated 18.5.2006. 5.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Though we are not granting leave, in view of re-iteration of plea taken in this special leave petition in several cases, the petition is being disposed of by a detailed order. Challenge is to the order passed by a  Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the petitioner.  Challenge in the writ petition was to the order dated 28th July, 2006 passed by the Chief Commissioner of Customs, Gujarat Zone, Ahmedabad. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Petitioner had applied for compounding of an offence committed by him under Section 135 (1)(a) of the Customs Act, 1962 (in short the ’Act’).  After considering the application filed by the petitioner, the Compounding Authority allowed the application and imposed compounding amount of Rs. 10,00,000/-. In the writ petition stand taken by the petitioner was that the compounding amount as fixed is beyond the permissible limit.  This plea was rejected by the High Court. In support of the petition, it has been stated that the extent of compounding amount as fixed by the Compounding Authority was beyond the permissible limit.  It is submitted that market value of the goods which had not been declared was Rs. 8,45,176/- and therefore it should have been 20% of the said market value. It is stated that since the purpose of compounding is to prevent unnecessary litigation, if the interpretation given by the High Court  that the quantum has to be upto 20% of the market value of the goods or upto  Rs.10,00,000/- whichever is higher is accepted same would be counter productive. The guidelines for compounding are contained in the Circular No.54/2005-Cus dated 30th December, 2005.  Central Government had brought into force the Customs (Compounding of Offences) Rules 2005 (in short the ’Customs Rules’) and Central Excise (Compounding of Offences) Rules, 2005) (in short the ’Central Excise Rules’) with effect from 30th December, 2005.  The purpose of compounding of offence http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 against payment of compounding amount is to prevent litigation and encourage early settlement of disputes.  The cases where compounding would be rejected are also spelt out in the said circular.  The relevant Rule is Rule 5 of the Customs Rules which so far as relevant reads as follow: Fixation of the Compounding Amount- For the purpose of compounding of offences under the various provisions of the Act, the compounding amount shall be as provided hereinbelow:- (1) \026 (3)   xxx              xxx             xxx (4)     Offence specified under Upto twenty per- Section 135(1) (a) of the       cent of market Act.                                    value of the goods or Rupees ten lakhs whichever is higher. (5) \026 (7)    xxx             xxx             xxx (Underlined for emphasis) The crucial words in the Rule are ""whichever is higher"". According to learned counsel for the petitioner, the word ""up to"" applies to both 20% of the market value of the goods or Rupees Ten Lakhs.  This interpretation as suggested is clearly unacceptable.  If the interpretation suggested is accepted, it would render expression ""whichever is higher"" redundant. The inevitable conclusion is that the petition lacks merit, deserves dismissal, which we direct.","Petitioner had applied for compounding of an offence committed by him under Section 135 (1)(a) of the Customs Act, 1962 (in short the ’Act’).

Pundit, Advs.  for  the appellant Dharam Bir Vohra, Adv. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI, J. In these  two appeals  the  State  is  challenging  the acquittal of  Chandrawati who  was convicted  by  the  trial court for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and Section 307 IPC but acquitted by the High Court. The trial  court had  convicted her  on  the  basis  of evidence of  two eye  witnesses P.W.2, Ram Lalit, aged about 11 years  and P.W.3,  Jagdei, aged  about 7 years.  The High Court on  reappreciation of  their evidence  found that  the witnesses had  made an  improvement in  their evidence  over their initial  version before  the  police  as  regards  the manner in  which P.W.3  Jagdei received the injury which was alleged to have been caused by Chandrawati.  In view of this infirmity in their evidence and also because Chandrawati had taken no  part in  beating deceased  Ranjana the  High Court held that  it was  not proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution that  Chandrawati entertained a common intention with her  husband to  kill Ranjana.  She was convicted under Section 307  for causing  injury to  P.W. 3  Jagdei  but  as pointed out  by the  High  Court  both  the  witnesses  were contradicted on  these points.   We  are, therefore,  of the view that  the High Court was not wrong in giving benefit of doubt to  Chandrawati as  regards the said injury alleged to have been  caused by  her.   The High  Court has  given good reasons for  acquitting her  of both the offences and we see no reason  to interfere  with the  view taken  by  the  High Court.  These appeals are therefore dismissed.","The State is challenging the acquittal of Chandrawati who was convicted by the trial court for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and Section 307 IPC.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati,J. In view  of the  consistent evidence  of PWs 1 and 2 it was not  possible for  the learned counsel for the appellant to  submit  that  the  view  taken  by  the  High  Court  is unreasonable justifying  for  interference  by  this  Court. Moreover, when  leave was  applied  for  by  all  the  three convicted accused  for filing  an appeal, this Court did not grant leave  to two.  The findings recorded against them are now to  be regarded  as final. It would not be proper now to hold that  evidence of  PWs 1  and 2  ought not to have been believed. In  view of this believed, the learned counsel did not seriously  challenge the  findings recorded  by the High Court. Once  the evidence  of PWs  1 and  2 is believed, the conviction of  appellant will  have  to  be  confirmed.  We, therefore, dismiss this appeal.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. The respondent  was appointed  on March  31, 1989 as an Extra-Departmental Branch  Post Master and he had joined the post on  May 16,  1989. His  appointment was  terminated  on February 25,  1991. He filed O.A.No.81/91 in CAT at Cuttack. The Tribunal  by order  dated August  24, 1994 set aside the order of  termination on  the ground that it did not contain any reason  nor any  opportunity is given to the respondent. Therefore,  it   was  violative  of  principles  of  natural justice.  Accordingly,  it  directed  reinstatement  of  the respondent with all consequential benefits. Thus this appeal by special leave. Rule 6  of the  Posts and  Telegraph Extra-Departmental Agents (Conduct and Salaries) Rules, 1964 provides that: ""6. Termination of Services: The service of  an  employee  who  has  not  already rendered   more    than   three    years continuous service  from the date of his appointment   shall    be   liable    to termination by  the appointing authority at any time without notice."" The question is whether the termination of the respondent is in  accordance  with  this  rule.  There  appears  to  be  a complaint laid against the respondent that he had produced a false income  certificate before  seeking appointment.  That was taken  into account  while making the appointment of the respondent as  Extra-Departmental Branch  Post Master. It is settled law  that if  any material adverse to the respondent formed a  foundation for  termination, principles of natural justice may  necessarily require  that prior  opportunity of notice be  given and after considering his reply appropriate order may be passed giving reasons in support thereof. If it is only  a motive  for taking  action, in  terms of  Rule 6, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 since that  rule provides  that such  a termination could be made within  three years  without any notice, there would be no obligation  on the  part of  the appellant  to issue  any notice and to give opportunities before termination. So each case requires to be examined on its own facts. It was  admitted on  behalf of  the appellants  in  the counter affidavit  filed before the Tribunal that the action was initiated on the basis of a report submitted against the respondent that he had produced false income certificate. In other words,  it formed  a foundation  and not  a motive for taking the  impugned  action.  Accordingly,  we  decline  to interfere with  the order  of the Tribunal setting aside the termination. However,  the respondent is not entitled to any backwages. The appeal  is accordingly allowed to the above extent.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Notice was  issued with  a view  to  impress  upon  the parties to  settle the  dispute amicably and learned counsel for the  respondents in  fairness submitted  that he  is not informed about  the settlement  and, therefore, he is unable to impress upon them to enter into any compromise.

We do not want to go into the controversy as to who is in possession  of the  land. It is true that the trial court on prima  facie evidence  found that  the appellant  was  in possession  of   the  land.

" Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice D.P. Wadhwa (Manoj Kumar  Mishra) Adv.  for A.S.  Bhasme,  Adv  for  the appellant P.R. Ramasesh, Adv. for the Respondent O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned Single  Judge of  the Karnataka  High Court, made on July 30, 1984 in Second Appeal No.646 of 1976. The appellant had filed a suit for specific performance of the sale agreement dated August 9, 1959 in respect of the land in Village Linganur for a consideration of Rs.10,200/-. It is  the case  of the  appellant  that  he  paid  as  part consideration a  sum of  Rs. 501/-  on the  said date  and a further sum  of Rs.700/- on March 4, 1960. In the meanwhile, the defendant  filed suit No.9/60 for possession of the said properties. The  suit was  decided in his favour on November 9, 1971.  The appellant,  therefore, issued  notice for  the first time  on August  22,  1972.  Thereon,  the  respondent denied execution  of agreement. Then the appellant filed the suit on  November 5,  1972. Thus, according to the plaintiff the suit  was filed  within limitation.  The respondent  has denied the  execution of  the agreement  of  sale,  but  the courts below have found that it is one of money transaction. It is,  therefore, clear  from Suit  No.9/60 it self that he had asserted  to be  the  owner  of  the  property  and  the property is  unencumbered property.  Therefore, no one has a right to  interfere with  his possession.  Thus, it could be seen that the suit document itself was denied as early as in 1960. As a consequence, mere issuance of notice dated August 22, 1972  does not  stop the  running of  limitation period. Once the  same has  began to  run, it  runs its full course. Therefore, the  suit having been filed after the expiry of 3 years  from  the  dated  of  the  knowledge  of  denial,  by operation of  Article 54  of the  Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963,  the suit is hopelessly barred by limitation. The High Court,  therefore, is  right in  dismissing the suit in the second appeal. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","The appellant had filed a suit for specific performance of the sale agreement dated August 9, 1959 in respect of the land in Village Linganur.

Concurrent findings of  fact   cannot  be   disturbed  save   on   enormity   of improbability which  we are  unable to  see in  the  present case.

" CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 3693  of 1989. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 734 From  the Judgment and Order dated 23.2. 1989  of  Delhi High Court in R.S.A. No. 31 of 1989. K.S. Bindra, R.K. Maheshwari and G.S. Gujananip for  the Appellant. Prem Sunder Jha for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHARMA, J. This appeal by special leave arises out of  a suit filed by the respondent-company against the  appellant, Municipal  Corporation of Delhi, for a mandatory  injunction to restore the supply of electricity discontinued during the pendency  of  the suit. Initially the suit was filed  for  a prohibitory  injunction  from  disconnecting  the   electric connection. The plaint was amended following stoppage of the supply of energy. 2. According to the plaintiff’s case, the suit had to be filed  as  the  Delhi  Electricity  Supply  Undertaking  was threatening  disconnection  without disclosing  any  reason. Subsequently,  some  officers  of the  Undertaking  made  an inspection  of the meters and alleged theft  of  electricity after  tampering  with the seals affixed on  the  meters.  A First Information Report was lodged with the police. 3.  Admittedly no notice was served by the  Delhi  Elec- tricity Supply Undertaking on the plaintiff before  severing the  electric connection. The learned trial court,  however, dismissed  the  suit and the plaintiff appealed.  The  First Additional  District  Judge,  Delhi, who  heard  the  appeal decreed the suit on the sole ground of nonservice of  notice as  required under condition no. 36 in regard to  supply  of electricity by the appellant. The Delhi High Court dismissed the  appellant’s second appeal at the admission stage  by  a reasoned judgment. 4.  The learned counsel for the appellant has  contended that  in  view of the conduct of the plaintiff  in  stealing electricity,  the Court should in its discretion  refuse  to issue a direction for restoration of the electric supply. We are  afraid, it is not possible to agree with the  appellant for more reasons than one. The plaintiff is seriously  deny- ing the allegation of theft and it is not possible to assume the  accusation as correct without a full-fledged  trial  on this  issue. The case of Jagarnath Singh  v.B.S.  Ramaswamy, [1966] 1 SCR 885; relied upon on behalf of 735 the  appellant  is clearly distinguishable inasmuch  as  the consumer  in that case was convicted under the Indian  Penal Code,  and  the conviction was being maintained  in  appeal. Besides, the service of notice is a prerequisite for discon- nection,  and  the appellant can not be allowed to  go  back upon its words and refuse the consumer the benefit of notice as  contemplated by the agreement. The learned  counsel  for the appellant urged that the Delhi Electric Supply Undertak- ing will seriously suffer if this view is upheld. We do  not understand  as to what is the difficulty in the way  of  the appellant  to serve a notice on the consumer before  discon- tinuing the supply. It has to be appreciated that the licen- see Undertaking is performing a public duty and is  governed by  a special statute and the law also contemplates  service of  a notice before disconnection of supply of  electricity. The  courts  below  have made it clear that  they  have  not examined  the  case  on merits. The  question  whether,  the allegations of theft are true or not has to be examined  and decided in an appropriate proceeding, and the appellant will not, therefore, be prejudiced by the present judgment in its claim.  In the result, the appeal is dismissed but,  without costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 P.S.S.

" S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Heard parties. Briefly stated the facts are as follows: The Appellant filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as the cheque dated 6th April, 1993 in a sum of Rs.63720/-, issued by the 1st First Respondent in favour of the Appellant on Central Bank, had been dishonored with the remarks ""Insufficient Funds"".  The Appellant had issued a legal notice dated 28th April, 1993.  Receipt of the said notice is admitted.  A reply dated 21st May, 1993 was sent by the 1st Respondent.  However no payment was made. After trial the Judicial Magistrate-II, Kumbakonam, convicted the 1st First Respondent under Section 138 and directed payment of a fine of Rs.65000/-.  In default the 1st Respondent was to suffer simple imprisonment for one year.  The 1st Respondent challenged the conviction and sentence by filing Criminal Appeal No. 32 of 1995.  The same came to be dismissed by the Sessions Judge on 28th August, 1995. The 1st Respondent then preferred Criminal Revision No. 883 of 1995 before the High Court of Madras.  A learned Single Judge, by the impugned Order dated 20th July, 2000, set aside the conviction and acquitted the 1st Respondent.  The learned Judge acquitted the 1st Respondent on the ground that the Appellant had not proved that the cheque dated 6th April, 1993 had been issued for any debt or liability. In our view the impugned Judgment cannot be sustained at all.  The Judgment erroneously proceeds on the basis that the burden of proving consideration for a dishonored cheque is on the complainant.  It appears that the learned Judge had lost sight of Sections 118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  Under Sections 118, unless the contrary was proved, it is to be presumed that the Negotiable Instrument (including a cheque) had been made or drawn for consideration. Under Section 139 the Court has to presume, unless the contrary was proved, that the holder of the cheque received the cheque for discharge, in whole or in part, of a debt or liability. Thus in complaints under Section 138, the Court has to presume that the cheque had been issued for a debt or liability.  This presumption is rebutable. However the burden of proving that a cheque had not been issued for a debt or liability is on the accused.  This Court in the case of  Hiten P. Dalal vs. Bratindranath Banerjee reported in (2001) 6 S.C.C. 16 has also taken an http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 identical view. In this case admittedly the 1st Respondent has led no evidence except some formal evidence.  The High Court appears to have proceeded on the basis that the denials/averments in his reply dated 21st May, 1993 were sufficient to shift the burden of proof onto the Appellant/Complainant to prove that the cheque was issued for a debt or liability.  This is an entirely erroneous approach.  The 1st Respondent had to prove in the trial, by leading cogent evidence, that there was no debt or liability.  The 1st Respondent not having led any evidence could not be said to have discharged the burden cast on him.  The 1st Respondent not having discharged the burden of proving that the cheque was not issued for a debt or liability, the conviction as awarded by the Magistrate was correct.  The High Court erroneously set aside that conviction. In this view of the matter the impugned Judgment is set aside.  The conviction and sentence as awarded by the Magistrate by his order dated 21st March, 1994, stand.  The 1st Respondent is granted one months’ time to pay the fine.  In default thereof he shall suffer simple imprisonment for 3 months.  The fine, if realised, Rs.60,000/- therefrom shall be paid to the Complainant as compensation. The Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.  There will be no Order as to costs.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NOS.  447-449 OF 1997 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 17287,19671 and 17355/96 O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals  by  special  leave  arise  from  various orders of  the Division  bench of  the Allahabad High Court, made on  February 27,1996 etc. in writ Petition No. 31392/95 etc. The only  controversy is; whether the existing stock of rice on  the intervening  night of  30th September  and  1st October 1995  was liable  to levy  under the  U.P. Rice  and Paddy (Levy and Regulation of Trade) Order, 1985. Exercising the power under Section  3 of the Essential commodities Act, with  the   concurrence  of   the  Central  Government,  the appellant had  issued the  said order  imposing levy on rice effective from  the intervening  night of  September 30,1995 and October 1, 1995. This is in furtherance of clause (3) of the Levy  Order. It  is contended by the learned counsel for the appellant  that since  the levy  was effective  from the aforesaid period within the areas specified under the order, all  the  rice  mills  covered  are  subject  to  the  above notification. The High Court was not right in directing that the Order will be effective from October 1,1995 and that the direction that  the existing  stock as  on  the  intervening night of the said dates is not liable to levy is vitiated by error of law. We find no force in the contention. Clause 24 of the Order gives power to exempt as under: ""(1) With  the concurrence  of  the Central   Government,   the   State Government may-- (a) in the public interest increase or reduce the percentage of levy; (b) in  the public  interest exempt any area  from levy  or reduce  per cent; (c) in  the public  interest reduce the percentage  of  levy  from  any type of rice mill in any area; http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (d) exempt  wholly or  partly  from levy  and   variety  of  paddy  and rice."" It is  seen that the proceedings dated May 31, 1996 the Principal Secretary  to the  Government had  conveyed to all the authorities  concerned the  decision of  the Government, namely, ""  I am  directed to say that levy is lifted in U.P. from rice for rest of the Kharif 1994-95 till 30.9.1995 with immediate effect."" Thus, it  would be  seen that  the rice  stock existing with rice  millers as  on September 30,1995, in other words, all purchases  made/rice produced  by the  rice millers upto that date,  i.e., September  30,1995 stood  exempted.  While issuing the  levy  order,  the  exemption    order  was  not withdrawn. Consequently  levy order  issued in  exercise  of clause (3)  of the  Order  for  the  kharif  Season  1995-96 effective from  midnight of  September 30,1995 including the stock on hand as on that date, is not legal for the stock on hand as  on that date, is not legal for the limited stock on hand,   namely, the  stock existing with the rice millers as on the  intervening night   of September 30,1995 and October 1,1995. To  that extent only the exemption would operate and the levy  order would  become effective  in respect  of  all purchases made/rice  produced on  and from  the day break of October 1, 1995. The appeals are accordingly dispose of No costs.","The High Court was not right in directing that the Order will be effective from October 1,1995 and that the direction that the existing stock as on the intervening night of the said dates is not liable to levy is vitiated by error of law.

" O R D E R The  petitioner  in  the  first  instance  invoked  the jurisdiction of  the civil  Court and obtained an injunction against the respondent from proceeding with the construction said to  be in  violation of  his easement  right of air and light The  respondent filed  a  writ  petition  against  the Municipal Corporation  impleading the petitioner, contending that his  construction was in accordance with the permission accorded by  them and,  therefore, he  may be  permitted  to proceed with  the construction.  Thereafter, an  application came to  be filed  for appointment  of a  Commissioner.  The learned Single Judge passed an order directing the Principal District Munsiff,  Vijayawada to  appoint a Commissioner and after notice  to the parties, the Commissioner would inspect and  submit   a  report   to  the  High  Court  whether  the construction was  in accordance  with the permission granted by the Municipal Corporation or in violation thereof. It is not in dispute that an Advocate Commissioner came to be  appointed and   he  submitted the  report. It appears that before  submitting the  report, the respondent seems to have filed the Civil Revision Petition under section 115 and obtained stay  of Commissioner’s  submitting the report. The Commissioner, in  the  meantime,  completed  inspection  and returned the  warrant to  the Civil  Judge.  The  respondent filed an  appeal against  the  order  of  the  single  Judge appointing the  Commissioner before  the Division Bench. The Division Bench  in the  impugned order  pointed out that the writ petition  was not  maintainable and it would be open to the appellant to amend the plaint in the civil suit and seek appropriate remedy.  Accordingly the  impugned  order  dated June 19,  1996 came to be passed in Writ Appeal No.58/86.

We do not find any force in the  contention. In  views of  the fact  that the  remedy available to  the petitioner  in the  civil suit has already been availed  or, the  high Court  has rightly  declined  to interfere and dismissed the writ petition of the respondent. While disposing  of the writ appeal, the High Court directed the parties  to approach  the civil  Court and  of avail the remedy by  amending the  plaint accordingly.  Therefore,  it would not  be open  to the  petitioner to  have  his  plaint amended suitably and seek appropriate relief on the basis of the report of the Commissioner. The petition  is dismissed accordingly.

Two contentions  have been  raised by  the  respondent, viz., that  the was a civil servant and that he was entitled to an enquiry before termination of his service and since it was not  done the  order was invalid. He also stated that he had gone  on leave  with permission  of the  authorities and that, therefore,  it cannot be said that he absented without authority of  absence. We find that both the contentions are untenable. The Punjab Public Works Department Code would  indicate that the  Code would apply to the Work-charged Establishment of  the   Public  Works   Department,  Roads   and  Building Department.  The   respondent  was   working  in  Irrigation Department.  Rule  1.132  indicates  that  a    work-charged employee is  not entitled  to any pension, leave, travelling allowance etc.  He is liable to be terminated under the Code by giving  10 days’  notice as  it required in clause [7] of Rule 1.129  of the  Code.   Under these circumstances, it is clear that  the respondent  is  not  a  Government  servant. Unless his  services are regularised in accordance with law, his   services remain  to be  of a work-charged employee. He was  terminated  in  accordance  with  the  above  procedure http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 prescribed thereunder. It would  be seen that from May 1986 to August 19, 1986 the respondent remained absent. from duty without any proper sanction of  the competent  authority or grant of leave. The courts have  proceeded on  the premise that he was absent on leave for  a short period of 10 days. In fact, it is not so. The circumstances  indicate that  the courts  below have not applied their minds in correct perspective, to the legal and factual aspects. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  suit  of  the respondent  stands  dismissed,  but  in  the  circumstances, without costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the Order of the High  Court of Punjab & Haryana made on march 9, 1994 in R.S.A.

State  of Punjab &  others and  Nanak Chand  and others  v.  State  of Punjab and others, respectively to this judgment. There is  another problem  which arises  in  these  two cases and  that is  that the  Delhi Administration has put a ceiling on  the total  number of cycle rickshaws permissible to be  plied within its territory perhaps-we do not know for certain-this number  may not  accommodate all the applicants for cycle  rickshaws applying  licencees. We  are told  that apart from  the applicants in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution,  there are  numerous petitioners  who have approached the  High Court of Delhi under Article 226 of the Constitution and  yet others  who have  filed suits in civil courts for  the same relief. All that we can do is to accept the suggestion  made by  the learned  Solicitor-General that the Delhi  Administration  will  effectively  publicize  and notify  applications  for  licencees  for  plying  of  cycle rickshaws and  all those  who apply  will be  considered  on their merits  including length  of service as cycle rickshaw pliers. The  criteria that  the  Delhi  Administration  will adopt must  be reasonable and relevant; otherwise it will be open to  the aggrieved  parties to  challenge the selection. Likewise we  do not  want to  fetter the  rights of  parties aggrieved if  the ceiling upon the total number of rickshaws permissible within the Delhi territory is arbitrary. On  the   basis  of   reasonable  criteria   the  Delhi Administration   will   direct   the   concerned   Municipal authorities to  grant licences  for plying  rickshaws and if the applicants  so chosen  are not owners themselves all the facilities we  have indicated  in the Amritsar order will be extended to  such cycle  rickshaw pliers  fixing  reasonable time  limits.  With  these  directions  we  dispose  of  the applications. Until  fresh licences  are issued by the Delhi Administration and  the Municipal  authorities  the  present petitioners will be allowed to ply their cycle rickshaws.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Having heard  the learned  counsel on  both  sides,  we think that  it is a fit case for our interference under Art, 136. It  would appear  that the  respondent is  representing daily wagers  in class  IV service  working  with  the  U.P. Madhyamik Siksha  Parishad, U.P.  Though the  High Court had found that  they have  been regularly  working for  over  15 years doing  similar work  on par  with the regular Class IV employees and consequentially directed the appellants to pay equal pay  for equal  work and  also regularisation of their services by  creating appropriate  posts, we  thin that  the directions given do not appear to be correct. It is  an administrative  procedure that  creation of a post is  a condition  for filling  up the  post on permanent basis. The exigencies of the administration and the need for the creation  of number  of posts  are matters  of executive policy by  the appropriate  government. It  is stated in the Special Leave  Petition filed  in this court that during the examinations conducted  by the  Board, when  the  exigencies demand for  doing the  manual work  like lifting of bundles, pasting of  envelopes and  shifting of answer books etc. the daily wagers  are engaged  and a  sum of Rs.25/- per day was being paid  as fixed  by the  dist. Magistrates of Allahabad under the  Minimum Wages  Act. Unless the posts are created, they are  not entitled  to be  fitted into any regular post. The performance  of the  manual duty may be like the duty of regular class  IV employees.  However, they are not entitled for the payment of equal wages so long as there are no posts created in  that behalf. We can understand that if there are vacant posts available in Class IV and they are filled up by appointing them to these posts on daily wages performing the same duties  of regular  employees,  perhaps  there  may  be justification for  issuing directions  for regularisation of their services  according to rules and payment of the salary http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to the  post to  which they  are fitted.  But in view of the fact that no posts are created or existing, we cannot uphold the direction issued by the High Court to pay equal wages or to regularise their services. It is  stated in  paragraph 5(h) of the S.L.P. that the Board has been regularising daily wagers in class IV service as and  when the  post is  created or  falls vacant,  on the basis of  length of  engagement  of  the  daily  wagers  and performance of  the work.  The procedure so adopted is fair. Under these  circumstances, we  think that  the  appropriate course would  be that  as and when regular posts are created or posts  fall vacant,  these daily  wage employees,  on the basis of  their seniority, length of service and performance of work,  may be  considered for regularisation according to rules and  rules of  regularisation according  to rules  and rules of  reservation in  vogue. Until  then their  services will be taken as and when exigencies would arise and payment of daily wages made as determined by the District Magistrate from time to time. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.",Daily wagers in class IV service working with the U.P. Madhyamik Siksha  Parishad.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned single  judge, made  on February  29,1996 in R.S.A.  No.   90/1983  by  the  Karnataka  High  Court.  The respondents had  filled  a  suit  in  the  trial  Court  for declaration that he had purchased two plots bearing Nos. 307 and 308  admeasuring 40’x31’  in Hubli town and for recovery of possession  on the  plea that the appellant has no manner of right  whatsoever to  interfere with  his possession. The trial Court  dismissed the  suit, On appeal, it was decreed. In the  second appeal, the learned judge confirmed the same. But in  the Review application, the single judge reheard the matter and  reversed the  decree of  the appellate court and confirmed that  of the  trial Court.  Thus, this  appeal  by special leave. It is  seen that  by an  order passed  by court on 24th November, 1995,  liberty was  given to the appellant, in the event of  the High  Court was  justified  in  reviewing  the earlier  order  and  reversing  the  find  recorded  by  the appellate Court ? It is not in dispute that the sale deed is for a  small sum  of Rs. 300/- and odd and that the property sold commands  good  market  value.  The  questions  arises: whether the  document was a sale deed  or is only a document for collateral purpose? The respondent himself in an earlier suit had  pleaded that  it was an agreement of sale, In view of such  an admission,  the High  Court has wrongly reversed the decree of the appellate court holding the transaction to be a  real sale,  In  the  second  appeal,  the  High  Court confirmed,  in   the  first  instance,  the  decree  of  the appellate Court.  Subsequently, the  High Court has reviewed the  judgment  and  reconsidered  the  matter  holding  that relevant precedents  were not  cited. Since  this court  had given liberty to raise the questions of reviewability of the judgment of  the High court, the question arises whether the High Court  could not  have embarked  upon  appreciation  of evidence and  considered whether there was an error apparent on the   face on record? It was contended before the learned single Judge  that various  decisions were not cited; proper http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 consideration was paid; in fact the sale deed was acted  for valid consideration.  The omission  to cite  an authority of law is  not a ground for reviewing the prier judgment saying that there  is an  error apparent on the face of the record, since the  counsel has committed an error in not bringing to the notice  of the  Court the  relevant precedents. In fact, since the  respondent had claimed that it is not a sale deed but was  executed for  collateral purpose,  it was  for  the respondent  to   establish  that   the  sale  was  for  real consideration and  he had a valid sale deed duly executed by the appellant.  The High  Court wrongly placed Burden on the appellant and  reviewed the  order and  heard the  matter on merits. The  entire approach  of the learned single judge is not correct in law. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The impugned order of the  High Court  stands  set  aside  and  decree  of  the appellate Court, as confirmed by the High Court in the first instance,  is  upheld.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. The appellant was married to the respondent in the year 1971. She  filed an  application under  Section 125, Code of Criminal  Procedure,   1973  [for  short,  ""the  Code""]  for maintenance on  July 21,  1988. The  learned  Magistrate  by order dated  February 28, 1990 granted a sum of Rs.100/- per month, i.e.,  Rs.200/- to the wife and Rs.100/- to his minor son with effect from the date of the order. On revision, the learned Additional  Sessions Judge, Kapurthala held that the wife  was  not  entitled  to  the  maintenance  and  granted Rs.100/- per  month only  in favour of the son. By its order dated July 2, 1991, the High Court confirmed the same on the ground that  the appellant was residing separately by mutual consent and  that, therefore,  she is  not entitled  to  the maintenance. The  maintenance to  the son  was  enhanced  to Rs.150/- per month. Thus this appeal by special leave. We have  seen  the  agreement  for  divorce  by  mutual consent under  which the  parties have  settled their terms. The  parties   have  not  challenged  the  validity  of  the agreement of  divorce. Therefore,  we proceed on the premise that it  is a  valid agreement  and the appellant has stated thereunder that due to irrecoverable differences between her and her husband, she has no objection to the divorce and she has no  claim or  any demand  from him.  She has also stated that the  respondent is  at liberty  to marry  anyone of his choice. He accordingly married another lady. Section 125 [4] of the Code provides as under: ""No  wife   shall  be  entitled  to receive an  allowance from  her  husband under this  Section if  she is living in adultery, or  if, without any sufficient reason, she  refuses to  live  with  her husband,   or   if   they   are   living http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 separately by mutual consent."" The concept of living separately by mutual consent arises so long as  the marriage subsists and the parties agree to live separately  by   consent.  In   other  words,   during   the subsistance of the marriage, no party is entitled to lay any claim for maintenance from the other party. In  view   of  the   divorce  agreement   referred   to hereinabove, the  marital relations have come to a terminus. By virtue thereof, the respondent had already contracted the second marriage. In other words, the first marriage has been put to  an end.  The appellant  thereby became  entitled  to claim maintenance and will continue to do so, so long as she remains unmarried and she is unable to maintain herself. It is contended that the appellant is having two kanals of land and that, therefore, she is not totally dependent on the respondent.  This aspect of the matter was considered by the learned  Magistrate  and  after  due  consideration,  he awarded the  sum of  Rs.200/-  towards  maintenance  to  the appellant and Rs.100/- to the minor son. Therefore, the mere fact that  she is  having  two  kanals  of  land  is  not  a sufficient ground to disentitle her to receive maintenance. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  orders of the Additional Sessions  Judge and  the High Court to the extent of maintenance  to the  appellant are  set aside and that of the Magistrate  is confirmed.  In other words, the appellant and her  minor son are entitled to Rs.200/- and Rs.150/- per month respectively  in terms  of the  order of  the  learned Magistrate and the High Court for maintenance of the son.","The appellant was married to the respondent in the year 1971.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R This appeal is directed against the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court dated 28.04.2005 whereby the Division Bench has confirmed the award given by the Labour Court. The respondent was serving as a Beldar in PWD ( B & R) and his services were terminated on 25.12.1999. A dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter to be referred to as the ’Act’) was raised and the matter was referred to Labour Court and the Labour Court after hearing both the parties found that there is a breach of Sections 25-G and 25-H of the Act.  It was held that person junior to the respondent is still working whereas the services of the respondent had been terminated. Therefore, the Labour Court allowed the claim of the respondent and granted reinstatement with continuity of service with 50% back wages from the date of demand notice i.e. from 1.2.2000.  Aggrieved against that order a writ petition was filed before the High Court and  the High Court affirmed the order of the Labour Court. Hence, the present appeal. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the appellant has failed to substantiate that no person junior to the respondent had been retained in the Department. It is a clear finding of the Tribunal that a person like Krishan s/o Dharam Singh who is junior to the respondent is still working with the Management whereas the services of the respondent had been terminated. It is also alleged that  another person named Mahabir who is also junior to the respondent is still working with the Management.  Therefore, the Tribunal has found violation of Sections 25-G & 25-H of the Act. This finding of fact has not been controverted by the management and there is no reason to take a different view from the view taken by the Tribunal which was affirmed by the High Court. Hence, we find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed. The respondent shall be reinstated but looking into the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, he will not be entitled to any back wages. The appellant shall issue order of appointment of the respondent within one month from the date of receipt of this order.

" Shivaraj V. Patil,J. Leave granted. This appeal is by the defendants in the suit filed for recovery of Rs. 3,84,455.44 with future interest @ 24% per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realization of the amount.  Suit summons were not personally served on the defendants.  However, the trial court, on the basis of newspaper publication, held that service of summons on defendants was sufficient.  In the absence of the defendants, the suit was decreed ex parte as prayed for by the plaintiff.  On coming to know the ex parte decree, passed against them, the defendants filed a petition under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The trial court dismissed the said petition. Aggrieved by the same, the defendants filed Miscellaneous Appeal before the High Court. The High Court allowed the Miscellaneous Appeal and set aside the ex-parte decree subject to the terms (i) the defendants shall, within a period of two months, deposit a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- with the trial court, (ii) shall furnish bank guarantee for the remaining sum claimed in the suit within the  said period of  two months and (iii) the amount so deposited shall be liable to be disbursed in accordance with the final order that may be passed in the suit.  It is to be noted that the plaintiff has not challenged the order setting aside ex parte decree. The only grievance of the appellants is that the terms, upon which ex parte decree is set aside, are onerous and not reasonable. On behalf of the respondents submission was made supporting the said terms as justified. Ordinarily, a money decree is not stayed unconditionally and the judgment-debtor would be put on terms.  Even so, such conditions must be reasonable having regard to all relevant factors. Although ex parte decree was passed against the appellants, once it is set aside on the ground of non-service of suit summons the money decree did not exist for execution.  It is no doubt true that in restoring a case the court may impose conditions to deposit costs or http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the decretal amount or some portion thereof or to ask the defendant to give security but such conditions should be reasonable and not harshly excessive.  In the impugned order the appellants are put on terms to deposit a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- and to furnish a bank guarantee for the remaining suit claim within a period of two months. In our view these terms are onerous, harsh and unreasonable in the facts and circumstances of the case and that too even before the trial of the suit on merits. On 29.10.2001, the learned counsel for the appellants stated that within two weeks, a sum of Rs. 50,000/- shall be deposited in the trial court and notice was issued on that day.  During the course of hearing the learned counsel informed that a sum of Rs. 50,000/- is already deposited in the trial court. We are of the view that it would be just and appropriate to direct the appellants to deposit a further sum of Rs.50,000/- in the trial court within a period of four weeks from today.  The terms to deposit Rs.2,00,000/- and to furnish a bank guarantee for the remaining suit claim shall stand modified as indicated above.  The impugned order shall remain undisturbed in all other respects. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R (ARISING OUT OF S.L.P. (C) NO.10392 OF 2004) Heard counsel for the parties. Leave granted. The High Court by its impugned judgment and order issued a writ of certiorari quashing the order dated January 17, 2003 whereby the contract of the respondent herein had been cancelled, and the order dated March 30, 2003 by which the District Magistrate, Kapurthala was directed to recover the amount of Rs.3,43,138/- from the account of the respondent herein at Kapurthala.  The High Court also issued a writ of mandamus directing the appellant herein to permit the petitioner \026 respondent to continue to work in pursuance of the contract awarded to the respondent on October 5, 2002. The contract was for a term of two years which has expired on October 4, 2004. The grievance of the appellant is that the High Court ought not to have gone into seriously disputed questions of fact in its writ jurisdiction.  The writ petitioner (respondent herein) challenged the action of the appellant contending that he was prevented by the appellant from working the contract.  This was disputed by the appellant.  It was submitted before us by reference to the record of an earlier petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. filed by the respondent wherein his case was that he was prevented from working the contract by the Truckers’ Union acting at the behest of the earlier contractor. In any event, since the facts were seriously disputed by the appellant, and no factual finding could be recorded without consideration of evidence adduced by the parties, it was not an appropriate case in which the High Court ought to have exercised its writ jurisdiction. The parties could have approached a civil court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. We agree with the appellant.  Having regard to the fact that the term of the contract has run out while dismissing the writ petition, we direct that in case any dispute arises in future concerning the said contract, and a court is called upon to adjudicate the matter, it shall while recording its findings and decision act on the basis of evidence adduced before it, uninfluenced by any observation made by the High Court in the impugned judgment. The interim order stands dissolved.  We observe that any claim relating to the period during which the interim order was in force, may also be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with law, if required to do so, in any dispute in future between the parties relating to the subject matter of this petition. This appeal is accordingly allowed.  No order as to the costs.","The High Court by its impugned judgment and order issued a writ of certiorari quashing the order dated January 17, 2003 whereby the contract of the respondent herein had been cancelled.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dismissing the First Appeal No. 681/2003 and upholding the order passed by learned Additional District Judge in Suit No.54 of 2001. Detailed reference to the factual  aspects would be unnecessary except noting the vital aspects. Suit No.54/2001 was filed in the Court of District Judge, Delhi. The same was for possession, recovery of  damages and mesne profit and rent  @ Rs.70,664/- p.m. i.e. On 26.2.2002 the learned Additional District Judge framed issues and the case was adjourned to 13.5.2002 for the evidence of the plaintiff. On 13.5.2002 the Presiding Officer was on leave and the case was adjourned to 29.5.2002 for the plaintiff’s evidence. On 29.5.2002 none appeared for the defendant and the matter was adjourned to be taken up on 31.5.2002 for final arguments and the matter was directed to be placed for orders after lunch.  Finally, the suit was decreed. The appeal filed by the defendants was dismissed. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the course adopted by the trial Court has no sanctity in law. The matter was listed on 13.5.2002 for plaintiff’s evidence and was subsequently adjourned to 29.5.2002. Even if the defendants were not present the order could have been at the most to set the defendants ex parte and another date should have been fixed. Interestingly, the matter was taken up that very day and a long judgment  running into several pages was delivered. It was submitted that the reason for non-appearance was indicated to be wrong noting of the date by learned counsel appearing for the defendants. The High Court did not discuss any of the pleas and the submissions and by a cryptic order dismissed the appeal. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 submitted that the appellants have not come with clean hands, and they have given a wrong and distorted picture. We find that the High Court has disposed of the First Appeal practically by a non-reasoned order. It did not even consider the plea of the defendants as to why there was non- appearance.  Be that as it may, the course adopted by the trial Court appears  to be unusual. Therefore, we deem it proper to remit the matter to the trial Court for fresh adjudication. Since the matter is pending the trial Court shall dispose of the matter within three months from the date of receipt of our order. It is also proper that the appellants should pay cost to the respondent. Even if the reason for non-appearance is accepted to be correct, the plaintiff was certainly prejudiced. Merely because the learned counsel appearing for the defendants did not take proper care and caution that cannot be a ground to loose sight of the prejudice caused to the plaintiff-respondent. The same has to be meted out by costs which we fix at Rs.20,000/-.  The amount shall be paid within 10 days from today. A receipt shall be filed before the trial Court immediately thereafter so that our directions for disposal within three months can be duly complied with. Parties are permitted to place copy of our order before the trial Court so that necessary directions can be issued. The appeal is disposed of.","Suit No.54/2001 was filed in the Court of District Judge, Delhi. The same was for possession, recovery of  damages and mesne profit and rent.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Allahabad High Court made on August 31, 1995 in Writ Petition 6727/93.  For the recruitment in the year 1980, the Regional Manager of the appellant-corporation had prepared a waiting list  of 414  candidates to be recruited during peak season or  during   suspension of  any conductors or against leave vacancy for 15 days or one month. It would appear that the list  continued for  1980-81, 1981-82  and 1982-83.  The appointments were  to be  made during  the  peak  season  by notification in the newspapers and whoever would come within 7 days would be given appointment. Thereafter, in respect of absentees, seniority  was not  being adhered  to and juniors were given appointments. It would appear that the respondent is one of the candidates placed in the seniority list. Since he had  not received  the intimation, he did not join during the  peak   seasons.  He  filed  a  writ  petition  in  1993 challenging his  non-appoint, hetook  the  plea  that  those juniors to  him were already appointed and some of them were even regularised. The High Court has accepted the contention and given  the direction  to appoint  him  to  the  post  of conductor  since   some  of  his  juniors  had  come  to  be appointed. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Shri   Pradeep   Misra,   learned   counsel   for   the Corporation, has  contended that the Corporation has evolved the principle  of wait list to meet the contingencies during peak season  etc. The  wait-list, for  the year 1980 in fact was cancelled  in July  19, 1980;  the writ  petitions which came to  be filed  against the  cancellation were dismissed; the respondent  filed  the writ petition  for the first time in 1983; from 1988 onwards, the wait-list procedure has been dispensed with  and,  therefore,  the  High  Court  was  not justified  in   giving  the  direction.  Shri  Bhattacharya, learned counsel for the respondent, contended that since the newspaper had  no circulation  in the region in which he was living, he could not appear and join the post; but since his juniors came  to be  appointed and  some  of  them  benefit. Though we find force in the contention of Shri Pradeep Misra http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that the candidates have no right to the post since they are in  the    wait-list,  since  the  Corporation  has  already appointed some  of the  juniors who  are in the waiting list necessarily, before  following that  procedure, they  should have given intimation to those candidates who were placed in the waiting  list; if even then they do not turn up, then it could  be   taken  that   they  have  waived  the  right  of appointment. But  in this case, it might be that a candidate who was  in the  waiting list was under the expectation that he would get an order of appointment from the Corporation as and   when the  vacancy arises  and may be he could not read the newspaper,  though published. Under these circumstances, we think  that  after  the  cancellation  of  the  wait-list procedure, though  no one has a right; those who were on the wait list need to be considered in accordance with the rules in view  of the  fact that their juniors had got appointment and were  even regularised.  Therefore,  the  appellant  are directed to consider the case of the respondent as a special case and make appointment according to the procedure. Any other  persons who  had  not  approached  or  would approach the  Court belatedly,  would not be entitled to any relief. The appeal is accordingly disposed of No. costs.","This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment of the Allahabad High Court made on August 31, 1995 in Writ Petition 6727/93.

" THE 23RD DAY OF APRIL, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice B.L.Hansaria Hon’ble Mr. Justice S.B.Majmudar R.C.Pathak, Ravinder Bagai, R.K.Gupta, Ms.Prerna  Tandon   and  Ms.Naresh  Bakshi,  Advs.  for  the appellant R.P.Bansal, Sr.  Adv., Pramod  Dayal, Ajay K.Jain and Shashi Bhushan, Advs., with him for the Respondent O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: This appeal  arises against  to the  order of the Delhi High Court  made 26.5.1995 in Election Petition No.6/94. The appellant is  an unsuccessful candidate in respect of one of the Assembly  Constituency known  as No.64,  Sadar Bazar, to the  National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi  Assembly.  The elections were  held on  6th November,  1993. The respondent secured 27216 votes while the appellant secured 25786 votes. The latter  filed an  election petition  on diverse  grounds including  corrupt   practices  under  Section  123  of  the Representation of  the People  Act,  1951.  The  High  Court dismissed his  election petition under Section 86 of the Act on its  findings on  four issues  framed in that case. While upholding the  findings in favour of the appellant on issued Nos.1 to 3, it held that the requisite number of true copies of  the   election,  petition   were  not  supplied  to  the respondent in  compliance with  Section 81(3)  of  the  Act. Reasons in support thereof are some grave mistakes including omission to  supply full  text of page No.18 of the election petition. Another  contention raised  by the  respondent was that the  affidavit is  not a  true of copy of the affidavit which was  filed  in  the  Court  along  with  the  election petition. Though it was rejected by the High Court as one of the grounds  against the rejection of the election petition, the respondent has filed cross objections. It is  not necessary  for us  to go into the grounds on which the election petition was dismissed by the High Court. Suffice it  to state  that  the  objections  raised  by  the respondent regarding  non-supply of  the true  copy  of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 affidavit is a formidable objections which merits acceptance in view  of the  recent judgment of this Court in Dr. (Smt.) Shipra etc.etc. vs. Shantilal Khoiwal etc. etc. [JI 1996 (4) SC 67].  Therein the  copy of  the affidavit supplied to the respondent was  not attested  by the Oath Commissioner. This Court, after  considering the entire case law, held that the affirmation before the prescribed authority in the affidavit and the  supply of  its true  copy is  mandatory so that the returned candidates could not be misled in his understanding that imputation  of the  corrupt  practices  ere  prescribed authority. For  that purposes, Form 25 prescribed by Section 83 requires  verification before  prescribed authority.  The concept of substantial compliance has no application in such a case.  It is  seen that the copy of the affidavit supplied to the  respondent does  not contain  the affirmation by the Oath Commissioner.  Under these circumstances, the defect is not a  curable  defect.  Therefore,  the  dismissal  of  the election petition on this ground is sustainable in law. Learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on an order of  this Court  C.A. No.  925 of 1995 (boots Singh vs. Sher Singh  & Ors.)  decided on March, 13, 1996. It would be seen that  a Bench  of two  Judges of  this  Court  has  not expressed any  conclusive opinion on the controversy. On the other hand, this Court remitted the matter to the High Court for reconsideration  in accordance  with  law.  Under  these circumstances, the  ratio therein is of no assistance to the appellant. The appeal  is dismissed.  But, in  the  circumstances, without costs.","This appeal  arises against the order of the Delhi High Court made 26.5.1995 in Election Petition No.6/94.

" RAJENDRA BABU, J.: L.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J Pipal  Singh, appellant in Criminal Appeal No.  432 of 1999  and  Mukhtiar Singh, appellant in Criminal Appeal  No. 433  of  1999,  were accused along with several  others  for having  caused  the  death of Sardara Ram  and  injuries  to Sukhdev  Raj  when they were entering their own  land.   The learned  Sessions Judge sentenced the appellants along  with certain  others  to undergo life imprisonment and to  pay  a fine of Rs.  5000/- each or in default of payment of fine to further  undergo  rigorous imprisonment for one  year  under Section  302  IPC  read with Section 34 IPC for  murder  and further  sentence  to undergo rigorous imprisonment for  six months  for  simple  hurt under Section 323  IPC  read  with Section  34 IPC and both the sentences to run  concurrently. On  appeal  the High Court reappraised the evidence  adduced before  the trial court and came to the conclusion that  the appellants  had  a common cause and had come  together  duly armed  at  a place which was in possession of  the  deceased with  the common intention to commit the crime and they left the  scene  of  the  occurrence  also  together  with  their respective  weapons.   The  High   Court  recorded  the  two injuries  found on the dead body of the deceased, viz.,  (i) T-shaped incised wound 15 cms x 2 cms by 10 x 2 cms on right parietal  region, underlying bone, scalp and brain were cut, and  (ii) incised wound 5 x 1.5 cms, 5 cms behind injury No. 1  and  that injury No.  (ii) was bone deep and  the  doctor opined  that  injuries Nos.  (i) and (ii) were fatal in  the ordinary  course  of nature.  The evidence put forth  before the  court  was  that  while Pipal Singh  caused  the  first injury,  injury  No.   2  was said to have  been  caused  by Mukhtiar Singh.  That evidence had been believed by the High Court. The  learned counsel for the appellants put forth  two contentions,  namely,  (1) the effect of acquittal of  other accused  in the case on sentencing accused under Section 302 IPC  by  involving  Section 34 IPC, and (2) as  regards  the offence stated to have been committed by each of them. Even  where some out of several accused are  acquitted http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 it  is  open  to  the court to  consider  whether  remaining accused  were  guilty of an offence by involving Section  34 IPC  by  reason of having committed the offence  along  with others  acquitted.   With  a view to  determine  the  common intention,  the  nature  of   injuries,  background  of  the incident and the nature of weapon used to cause the injuries besides other factors are needed to be considered.  There is no principle in law which prevents from adopting that course set  out  above by us.  In the circumstances arising in  the case  the  High  Court has done the  necessary  exercise  in finding out whether the accused needed to be convicted under Section  302  IPC  read  with Section 34 IPC.   We  find  no infirmity in the same. So  far as the evidence alleged against the accused is concerned  and  the manner in which they have committed  the same,  it is clear that Section 304 Part II would not  arise as  rightly  held  by  the High Court.  So  neither  of  the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellants can survive close scrutiny and stand rejected. The appeals are dismissed.",Pipal Singh and Mukhtiar Singh were accused of killing Sardara Ram and injuring Sukhdev Raj. They were sentenced to life in prison and a fine of Rs. 5000 each.

" J U D G E M E N T Nanavati ,  J. The two  respondents were  convicted under  section 302 read with  Section 34  IPC for  causing death of Shanku. The trial court  based their conviction upon the evidence of PWs 1,2,3 and  4. The  High  court  after  reappreciating  their evidence  set   aside  the   conviction  and  acquitted  the respondents. The High  Court in its judgement has observed that upto a certain  point, the  prosecution version  and the  defence version are  the same  and, therefore, the only question was whether the  deceased and  PWs 1  and 3 were the aggressors. After taking  into consideration  the fact  that all the eye witnesses were close relatives of the deceased and that they had not explained the injury on accused No.1, the High court came  to the conclusion that it was not proved  by the prosecution that  the respondents  were the  aggressors. The High Court  further   observed that out of the two versions, the version of the defence was more probable. Thus accepting the defence  versions, the High Court allowed the appeal and acquitted the respondents. After scrutinising  the evidence,  we do  not find that the view  taken by  the High Court is unreasonable and calls for any  interference by  this court. However, we would like to say that the observation made by the High Court that even if the  prosecution evidence was believed, the accused could have been convicted only under Section 323 IPC and not under Section 302, does not appear to be correct.

" O R D E R Though the respondent is served, no one appears for the respondent. Leave granted. The appellant is the wife, against whom her husband had obtained an  ex-parte decree of divorce. After obtaining the decree, the  husband died. The wife on coming to know of the ex-parte decree,  applied for  setting aside  the decree  of divorce under  Order  IX  Rule  13  of  the  Code  af  Civil Procedure. The  Trial Court  dismissed the  said application observing that  since the  divorce is  a personal remedy, it cannot be pursued after the death of the husband. On appeal, the Trial  Court’s view  was  reversed.  But  the  Appellate Court’s view has in turn been reversed by the High Court. We are  of the  opinion that  the wife should be and is competent to  maintain the  application under  Order IX Rule 13. Even though the husband is dead, yet the decree obtained by him  is effective in law and determines the status of the appellant. If  the appellant  says that  it is  an  ex-parte decree and  ought to be set aside, her application has to be heard on merits. The decree of divorce determines her status as  a   wife  apart  from  determining  her  rights  in  the properties  of   her  deceased   husband.  This   gives  her sufficient locus  standi and  right to  contest the  divorce proceedings even after the death of her busband.

Speaking generally, Courts cannot enforce law and order by  issuing general  directions without  reference  to specific instances.  The Government  has to  assess, in  the context of  the prevailing  conditions, the  impact  of  the steps taken  to enforce  law  and  order.  And,  it  is  the executive which has to take a policy decision as regards the steps to be taken in a given situation, after 903 taking into account the demands of the prevailing situation. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We do  not commend  or suggest  that the  police  should  be silent spectators  to wanton  destruction  of  life  but  we cannot, as  men of  some little  experience of law and life, commend  that  the  police  must  enter  places  of  worship forcibly.

" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot of land on 9th March, 1989 in the Govindpuram Plot Scheme.  He deposited the entire amount, but no plot was allotted to him. He thus filed a complaint.   It appears that during the pendency of the complaint before the District Forum possession was delivered to the Respondent on 29th September, 1995.  The District Forum held that as possession has been given belatedly compensation should be paid to the Respondent by way of interest at the rate of 18% on the amounts deposited by him from 1st January, 1992 till the possession was given. The District Forum also directed payment of Rs. 1,000/- for mental agony.   The State Forum dismissed the Appeal.  The National Forum confirmed the payment of interest at the rate of 18% per annum. We are told that interest at the rate of 18% has been paid, but some amount has been deducted as TDS.   We were shown Orders of the State Forum and the National Forum holding that on interest amounts no TDS can be deducted.  It could not be shown to us that these Orders have been stayed by this Court and/or that there is any contrary Order of this Court.  We are not going into the merits of such an Order but once there is such an Order the Appellants have to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 comply with that Order.    They therefore cannot deduct TDS. The Appellants have already paid interest at the rate of 18% per annum.  On the basis of the ratio laid down by us in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) the Appellants cannot claim any refund.  The Appellants shall now pay, within 4 weeks from today, the amount deducted as TDS with interest at the rate of 18% per annum thereon till the date of payment. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter having been passed on account of the special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases. This Appeal stands disposed off accordingly.",A large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition has been filed against the order of  the Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad dated March 28, 1995  made in  O.A. No.81344/90.  It is  the case of the petitioner that  he  had  the  requisite  qualification  for promotion as  a Senior Scientific Officer. But he was unduly denied of  his right  for consideration  for promotion  from Junior  Scientific   Officer.  Mr.  L.N.  Rao,  the  learned counsel, contends  that Rule  4(b) of  the A.P. Institute of Preventive Medicine  Service Ad  hoc Rules  to the  post  of Chief Public Analyst, Senior and Junior Scientific Officers, issued in  G.O.Ms. No.219  Health Medical  & Family Welfare, dated March  26, 1987  is ultra vires of the power. Once the petitioner   acquired   post-graduate   qualification,   the insistence of  S years  service after the acquisition of the post-graduation is  not warranted.  In support  thereof,  he placed reliance  on a  judgment of  this Court  in  Sheshrao Janglujibagde vs. Bhaiyya [(1991) Supp. 1 SCC 367]. Rule 4 (b) reads thus: ""Must have  not less  than S  years experience as  Post-Graduate in the analysis of  Food under the control of Chief  Public analyst/Government Analyst who  is appointed under the prevention  of   Food  Adulteration Act, 1954."" In view  of that mandatory rule that the candidate must have not  less than  S years  experience as post-graduate in the analysis  of the  food, the  intendment of  the rule  is manifested that  after acquiring  post-graduation, one  must necessarily have  not less  than S  years experience  in the analysis of  food. It would be relevant to mention that when the analysis  of food  for adulteration  is to  be made  the senior Scientific  Officer is  required to  counter test the report of  the analyst sent in that behalf, the Rule appears to have  intended that  he must  have expert knowledge after http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 acquiring post  graduation and  minimum period  of not  less than S  years experience  has been  prescribed and  insisted under the  rule. The  words ""not  less than""  furnishes  the legislative intention of mandatory character S years minimum experience after  getting post-graduate. Therefore, it being the legislative  policy, it  cannot be said that the rule is ultra vires or arbitrary. It is true that in the above-cited judgment, this Court has stated thus: ""Normally,  when   we  talk  of  an experience,  unless   the   context otherwise  demands,  it  should  be taken as experience after acquiring the minimum qualifications required and,  therefore,  necessarily  will have  to   be  posterior   to   the acquisition of  the  qualification. However, in the case of a promotion the same  interpretation may not be just or warranted."" But later  this Court  also  explained  that  it  would depend upon  the relevant  provisions as also the particular type of  experience which  is required. In that case, on the basis of the language contained in the rules, this Court had held that  the insistence  10 years  experience after  post- graduate was  not required.  In view  of the above mandatory language, we  cannot say  that the rule made was not correct in law. It is then contended that the Government have done away with the  minimum experience  after  postgraduation  in  the subsequent rules  and that,  therefore,  the  petitioner  is entitled to  be considered.  We have  no doubt that his case will be considered according to rules. The SLP is accordingly dismissed.",Petitioner had the requisite qualification for promotion as a Senior Scientific Officer.

" S. N. VARIAVA, J. Leave granted. Heard parties. L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J This  Appeal is against a Judgment dated 4th July, 2000. Briefly stated the facts are as follows: The  Respondents  had  issued an  advertisement  in  the newspaper  for filling up vacancies in various categories of services in Schools run by them.  The Appellants had applied for  the posts pursuant to the said advertisement.  They had appeared  in  written test as well as personality  test.   A panel  was  then prepared.  Appellants No.  1, 3 and 4  were empanelled.  Appellant No.  2 was not empanelled at all. As appointment letters were not issued to the Appellants they  filed a Writ Petition in the Calcutta High Court which was  allowed by a single Judge by Order dated 22nd December, 1999.   However,  in Appeal the Division Bench has,  by  the impugned  order dated 4th July, 2000, set aside the Order of the  single  Judge  and dismissed the Writ Petition  on  the ground  that  the vacancies which had been  advertised  were tentative.   The Division Bench has held that there were  no vacancies  and, therefore, no direction could be issued  for filling up the vacancies. Appellant No.  2 was not empanelled and, as such, has no right  to  make any claim to be appointed.   Therefore,  the Appeal  so  far  as  Appellant No.  2  is  concerned  stands dismissed. The  Appellants  No.  1, 3 and 4 were  empanelled.   Mr. Ghosh  appearing for the Respondents states that the life of panel,  so  far as General Category is concerned,  has  been extended  to  2nd February, 2002.  He states that there  are vacancies  and  Appellants  No.  3 and 4 will  be  appointed against  those  vacancies.   In view of this  statement  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Order  of the High Court, so far as Appellants No.  3 and  4 are concerned, is set aside. Appellant  No.   1  belongs to the  OBC  Category.   For reasons  best known to the Respondents, even though the life of  the panel for General Category has been extended to  2nd February,  2002, the same has not been done for the panel of the OBC Category.  It has been pointed out to us that in the OBC  Category there were vacancies, yet Appellant No.  1 was not  appointed  and the panel allowed to lapse.  We  see  no justification  for  not  appointing Appellant  No.   1  when vacancies  were available.  We also see no justification for not  extending  the  panel life of the  OBC  Category.   We, therefore,  direct  that Appellant No.  1 will be  appointed against  the  vacancies  which  are  available  in  the  OBC Category. With  the above directions, the Appeal of Appellants No. 1,  3  and  4 is allowed.  To that extent the Order  of  the Division  Bench stands set aside.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the Administrative Tribunal, Jabalpur M.P. Public Health and Family Welfare  Department Non-ministerial  (Related to  the Directorate Health  Services) Class-III Services Recruitment Rules, 1989  (for short  ’the Rules’), made under proviso to Article 309  of the  Constitution, prescribed  qualification for the  appointment of  Auxilliary Nurse-cum-Midwife (ANM), viz.,  10+2   with  Physics,   Chemistry  and   Biology   as qualitative subjects.  Admittedly, the  respondents had  not possessed that  qualification. It  would be  seen  that  the District Medical  Officer, therefore,  wrongly selected  the respondents and  sent them  to  the  training.  After  their successful completion  of the  training, he made appointment as A.N.M. in the pay scale of Rs.950-1350/-. The respondents were served  with notice dated 31st January, 1994 intimating that their  selection for  training was  illegal  and  their services would  be terminated  with effect from February 23, 1994. The  respondents challenged  the cancellation of their appointment. The Tribunal  in the  impugned order  had held that the respondents having  been selected and undergone the training and the  competent authority  having  duly  appointed  them, cancellation of their appointment without any opportunity is violative of  the  principles  of  natural  justice  and  it accordingly  set   aside  the   order  and   directed  their reinstatement  with  consequential  benefits.  Hence,  these appeals by special leave. It is  now an  admitted fact  across the  Bar that  the respondents   had    not   possessed    the    pre-requisite qualification, namely,  10+2  with  Physics,  Chemistry  and Biology as  subjects. The  Rules specifically  provide  that qualification as  a condition for appointment to the post of ANM. Since prescribed qualifications had not been satisfied, the initial selection to undergo training is per se illegal. Later appointments thereof are in violation of the statutory rules. The  Tribunal, therefore,  was not right in directing the reinstatement  of respondents. The question or violation http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the  principles of  natural justice  does not  arise. The ratio of Shrawan Kumar Jha and Others vs. State of Bihar and others (AIR  1991  SC  309),  strongly  relied  on,  has  no application to the facts of this case. That was a case where appellants possessed initial qualifications but they did not undergo the training. Since the appointment was set aside on the ground  of want of training, this Court interfered with; directed the  Government to  reinstate them into service and further directed  them to  send the  appellants therein  for training. The appeals  are allowed  and O.As. stand dismissed. No costs.","Appeals by special leave arise from the order of the Administrative Tribunal, Jabalpur M.P.

The admitted position  is that  the renewal of the insurance was effected as under: Address; Jal Apartment,  .......Pd. Vile Parle (N) Bombay 5. It is  hereby understood and agreed that the  renewal  premium  of  Rs. 1307/-  only   under  this   Policy having been  paid on 25.10.1983 and not within  the renewal  date  viz. 14.10.1983 the  Insurance  by  this Policy is suspended from 14.10.1983 (4 p.m) to 24.10.1983. Further, it  is declared and agreed that the cover under this Policy is reinstated  and   renewed   for   a further  period  of  twelve  months from 25.10.1983  to 24.10.1984 at a premium of Rs.1307/-. The Tribunal  also had  recorded, as  a fact,  that  on October 25,  1983 at  4.00 p.m., the contract of renewal had come into  force and  it would be operative upto October 24, 1984. The  Tribunal also  recorded,  as  a  fact,  that  the accident had  occurred on  October 25,  1983 at  11.14 a.m., that is  , before  the renewal  of the contract. Under these circumstances, it  would be  clear  that  the  accident  had occurred when the renewal had not taken effect. This Court  in New  India Assurance  Co. vs.  Ram Dayal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 [(1990) 2  SCR 570]  had held  that in  the absence  of  any specific time  mentioned in that behalf, that contract would be operative  from the  mid-night of the day be operation of provisions of  the General  Clauses Act.  But in view of the special contract  mentioned in the insurance policy, namely, it would be operative from 4.00 p.m. on October 25, 1983 and the accident  had occurred  earlier thereto,  the  insurance coverage would  not enable  the claimant to seek recovery of the amount from the appellant-Company.

These  appeals by  special leave are directed  against the  Judgment of  the  High  Court  of Bombay (Panaji  Bench) dated  2.11.1982 whereby  a  Division Bench of  the High  Court allowed  a batch of Writ Petitions filed by  some students who had appeared in the XII standard examination conducted  by the  Goa, Daman  and Diu  Board of Secondary and  Higher Secondary  Education and  declared the provisions of  clauses (1)  and (2)  of Rule 37 of the rules framed by the Administrator of Goa, Daman and Diu under Goa, Daman and Diu Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board Act as  ultra vires  and invalid  insofar as  they  prohibit inspection and/or  revaluation of  answer books. In reaching the said  conclusion on  the validity  of the impugned rules the High  Court followed  its earlier  Judgment in  Paritosh Bhupesh Kumarsheth  and others v.

" J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH,J. In this appeal by special leave the appellant has challenged  his conviction under Section 307 IPC.    The trial court sentenced him to undergo  4 years rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- and in default to undergo two months rigorous imprisonment.   The High Court by its impugned judgment and order of 11th November, 1988 in Criminal Appeal No.311 of 1991 upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to 2 years rigorous imprisonme nt. It maintained the sentence of fine. With the assistance of counsel appearing for the parties, we have gone through the evidence on record. The case of the prosecution is that on 20th May, 1990 at about 4.00 P.M. an altercation took place between PWS 2 and 3 on the one hand, and the appellant on the other. That altercation was followed by  PW2 slapping the appellant.   This occurrence took place a t 4.00 p.m.  Later  at 9.00 P.M. when PWs 2 and 3 closed their shop and left for their house o n a scooter driven by PW2, the appellant along with one Ravindra Swamy accosted them on the way. Ravindra Swamy hit the scooter with an iron rod as a result of which  PW2 and PW3 fell down, whereafter the appellant is said to have stabbed PW2 with knife in his abdomen.    PW2 was taken to the hospital.  On the basis of the report lodged by PW3 the case was investigated a nd ultimately the appellant along with Ravindra Swamy was put up for trial before the Additiona l Sessions Judge, Pune being Sessions Case No.317 of 1990. At the trial the prosecution relied upon the evidence of PWS 2 and 3.   It also reli ed upon the recovery of weapon of offence, namely, a knife at the instance of the appellant. On chemical examination, it was found that the knife had human blood on it of ’AB’ group which was the blood group of the injured.   Relying upon the aforesaid evidence, the trial court convicted the appellant of the offence under Section 307 IPC.    It, however, gave benefit o f doubt to the co-accused Ravindera Swamy since his name did not find mention in the First Informati on Report and, therefore, his complicity in the occurrence appeared to the trial court to be do ubtful. On appeal preferred by the appellant, the High Court affirmed the order of conviction but reduced the sentence as earlier noticed. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant had also received injuries in the course of the said occurrence which remained unexplained by the prosecution. We have examined the evidence on record.    This submission has no force because in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the first instance, there is no evidence on record to prove that the appellant had received any injury.  Moreover, there is no suggestion made to PWS 2 and 3 that they had assaulted him as a result of which he had suffered any injury.   In the absence of any such suggestion to the prosecution witnesses, the argument which is not supported by any evidence on record, cannot be accepted.   While it is true that burden is heavy on the prosecution to prove every ingre dient of the offence,  while the defence   has only to probabalise the defence taken, there must b e some material on record to support the defence plea and probabalise its case.   We find that comp letely lacking in this case.   Moreover, PW2 is an injured witness who was the victim of the assaul t and PW3 was accompanying him.    Two courts below have concurrently found their evidence to be acceptable, and we find no reason to take a different view. The appeal is dismissed. The appellant was released on bail by this Court pending the appeal.   His bail bond s are cancelled and he is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaind er of the sentence, having regard to the provisions of Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedu re.","In this appeal by special leave the appellant has challenged his conviction under Section 307 IPC.

The  exemption  so claimed was on the basis that ayurvedic herds are taxable at the point  of last  purchase in the State by a dealer who is liable to  pay tax.  The Ayurvedic  College being  the  last purchaser, the appellant obtained valuation certificate from the College  for quantity  of herds  purchased by  them  and furnished  the  same  before  the  Sales  Tax  Officer.

This  view taken by the High Court has been  challenged in  this appeal.  It was urged that the valuation certificate  obtained from  the party  to whom the goods  had   been  sold   was  substantial   compliance   of requirement of sub-rule (14) of Rule 32 of the Rules, having regard to  the fact  that party,  being a  government  body, could not fulfil all the requirements of Form-25. Having heard the matter and perused the record, we find the crucial  question that arises in the present appeals is, as to  whether the  Government Ayurvedic College, Trivandrum comes within  the expression""  State"" occurring  in  Section 2(viii) of  the Act  which defines  ""dealer"".  Further,  the second question  that arises  for consideration  is,  as  to whether the  certificate issued  by  the    Govt.  Ayurvedic http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 College substantially satisfied the requirements of sub-rule (14) of  Rule 32  and Form-25.  But,  these  questions  have neither been  dealt with by the Sales Tax Authorities nor by High Court.  Initially, we thought to decide these questions here. But,  in the absence of material facts, it is not safe to  decide   these  questions   in  this   appeal.  In  such circumstances, we  set aside  the order  and judgment of the High Court  of Kerala dated 3.9.1989 in TRC Nos. 106,107 and 108 of  1989, send  these cases  back to  the High Court for deciding the  questions referred  to above.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  dated May 24, 1995 of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeal  No.401/92. The  appellant was  working as  a Hindi Pandit in the L.T. Grade. The Bazpur Cooperative Sugar Factory  Inter   College,  Bazpur,   District  Nainital  was upgraded from High School. Four posts, including the post of a  Hindu   Pandit,  were  sanctioned  for  recruitment.  The appellant is  an M.A.,  Ph.D. in  Hindi. He staked his claim for  promotion   to  that  post.  It  was  not  acceded  to. Consequently, he  filed the writ petition in the High Court. The learned  single Judge  as well  as the Division Bench of the High Court have negatived his claim. Thus this appeal by special leave. The only question involved in this case is: whether the appellant is  eligible for  appointment as a Hindu Pandit in the  intermediate   college.  Shri  Pramod  Swarup,  learned counsel for the appellant contended that since one Smt. Lila Singh was  already working  in  the  school  as  a  Sanskrit teacher, insisting  upon his  having B.A. degree in Sanskrit is contrary  to the statutory rules and that, therefore, the High Court  was not  right in rejecting his abovesaid claim. We find  no force  in the  contention. It  is seen that Smt. Lila Singh is working as Sanskrit teacher in the High School but not  in the  college. As a consequence, when the vacancy had arisen  for Hindi Pandit in the college, admittedly, the qualification prescribed  is  M.A.  in  Hindi  and  B.A.  in Sanskrit, apart  from B.Ed.,  since both  Hindi and Sanskrit are to  be taught  by  the  same  teacher  in  the  college. Admittedly, the  appellant did  not possess  B.A. degree  in Sanskrit. Under  those circumstances, rejection of his claim cannot be  said to  be vitiated  by any  error  of  law.  In addition, the  High Court  has also  pointed  out  that  the Management had  stated in  their counter-affidavit  filed in the High  Court that  the said  post was  reserved  for  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Scheduled Caste  and was  notified  by  the  U.P.  Secondary Education Service Commission, His claim was rejected on that ground also. Under these circumstances, we do not think that it is a case warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment and order  dated May 24, 1995 of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeal  No.401/92.

This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated May  7, 1993  of the Administrative Tribunal of Madhya Pradesh made  in M.A.No. 7/92. The admitted position is that while the  respondent was working as Upper Division Teacher, he claimed the status as a Lecturer. That request came to be recognized by  proceedings  dated  March  3,  1962  but  was decided therein  that he  was not  entitled to the salary on the principle of "" no work, no pay"". After his retirement in 1983, after a considerable delay, the respondent had filed a writ petition in the High Court claiming all the arrears for the period  from 1962  to the  date of the order of notional promotion, viz.,  January 21,1983.  The  writ  petition  was transferred to  the Administrative  Tribunal after  its  re- constitution. Initially, the Tribunal had dismissed the writ petition by order dated December 27, 1991 on the ground that the  claim  was  belated.  Subsequently,  the  above  review petition came  to be filed which was allowed on merits. Thus this appeal by special leave. In view  of the fact that the claim was not adjudicated on merits in the first instance, it would appear that if the Tribunal found  that the earlier order was not correct, then it would  have gone into the merits by giving opportunity to the State  on  the  questions  whether  the  respondent  was entitled to the arrears, as directed by it on consideration, whether he  had discharged the same duties and whether other cases also  would be  applicable to  the  respondent.  Since these questions  were not addressed after hearing the appeal and in proper perspective, we think that the Tribunal has to go in  the matter  afresh.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2516 OF 2002 Respondent-assessee, hereinafter referred to as the ’assessee’, was a job worker and was engaged in the processing of fabrics falling under Chapter heading 54 & 55 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (for short ’the tariff Act’).  Assessee had accepted the declaration filed by the merchant manufacturers who was supplying fabrics to the assessee and gave an undertaking that it would comply with all the requirements and discharge all the liabilities under the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short ’the Act’). As per notification No.254/87 as amended by Notification No.57/89 dated 1.3.1989, benefit of concessional rate of duty is available to a man made fabrics containing polyster below seventy percent.

(contd.) - 2 - Collector, Central Excise believing that the statement of the assessee given in the classification lists was true and correct. Samples were collected from the assessee-company and they were got chemically tested which indicated that   they were having polyster above 70% and thus would attract higher rate of duty and the assessee company had mis- declared the contents of the fabrics at the time of filing the classification lists with deliberate intention to evade payment of excise duty. Consequently, a show cause notice dated 4.3.1993 invoking the extended period of limitation under Section 11A was issued to the assessee for the period 04.03.1989 to 16.01.1990 demanding differential duty of Rs.14,80,269.25 and also asking them as to why a penalty should not be imposed under the Central Excise Rules, 1944. The assessee had replied to the show cause notice vide its letter dated 7.9.1993 stating that the declarations given by merchants were relied upon and submitted to the department as prescribed by Notification No.305/77 and that the charge of mis-declaration was not tenable and therefore the demand was time barred.

" D E RL.....I.........T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J This  appeal  has been filed against the judgment  and order  dated  30th  June, 1998 passed by the High  Court  of Punjab  &  Haryana  at Chandigarh  dismissing  the  Criminal Appeal  No.502 DB of 1997 filed by the present appellant and confirming  the judgment and order passed by the  Additional Sessions  Judge,  Bhiwani  in  NDPS Act  Case  No.15/96  and Sessions  Trial  No.49/96 on 17th/21st March, 1997,  whereby the  appellant Jagar Singh and another person Sukhdev  Singh were convicted and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 20 years and to pay a fine of Rs.2 lakhs each and in default of payment  of fine to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for a  period  of  5 years.  The High Court allowed  the  appeal filed  by Sukhdev Singh but confirmed the conviction of  the appellant Jagar Singh.  However, the High Court modified the sentence  and reduced it to 12 years rigorous  imprisonment. The  Court also reduced the fine from Rs.two lakhs to Rs.one lakh  and in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for  a further period of one year. At  the time of hearing of this appeal, Mr.  Rajiv  K. Nanda,  learned  Amicus  Curiae  has taken  us  through  the material evidence on record.  The case of the prosecution is that  the  appellant was the driver of a truck  bearing  No. HR-24/2851,  which  was  stopped  because  of  nakabandi  on Singhani  Chowk on Loharu  Dighawa road, district  Bhiwani. After the truck was stopped, one person opened the door from the  side  normally occupied by conductor and ran away  from the   truck.   The  driver  of   the  truck  was,   however, apprehended  and  questioned as the police  party  suspected that  some narcotic material was in the truck and the choice was  given to the driver Jagar Singh as to whether he  would like  to be searched by a gazetted officer.  After obtaining his  reply  in  affirmative,  Raj  Gopal,  DSP,  Loharu  was summoned  on  the  spot  by a wireless  message.   After  he arrived,  the truck was searched and 90 bags of  poppy-husk, each   bag  containing  40   kg.   poppy-husk,  were  found. Besides, 125 bags of salt were also found.  After completing necessary  formalities,  seizing  of  articles  and  drawing samples,   the   accused-appellant   was  arrested.    After http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 completing  the investigation, the accused was challaned and thereafter  tried  by  the Additional  Sessions  Judge,  who convicted and sentenced him as stated above. For connecting the accused with the crime, prosecution mainly  relied upon the evidence of PW3 Rajgopal DSP and PW4 Med Singh, SI of Police Station City Jind, district Bhiwani. In  the  statement  under Section 313 Cr.P.C.,  the  accused apart  from denying the prosecution version has stated  that police party stopped his truck by stating that they want the truck  for begar.  As he refused to oblige them, they took him  to  the  police  station,  gave  beatings  and  falsely implicated in this case. In  our view, the High Court as well as the Additional Sessions  Judge have rightly relied upon the evidence of the aforesaid  two witnesses.  There was no reason to disbelieve PW3  Rajgopal  DSP  who  went at the  spot  after  receiving wireless  message.   The  statement made under  Section  313 Cr.P.C.   is  without any substance because neither  of  the prosecution  witnesses were asked a question that the police wanted  to use the truck and as the accused refused to  hand over  the  said truck, he was falsely  implicated.

An Order of the Education Tribunal was challenged before the learned Single Judge and the same was set aside and hence this appeal by way of special leave. The respondent was employed as a teacher in a school owned and managed by the appellant.  An order was passed against the respondent terminating his service w.e.f. 21.8.1981.  According to the appellant, the respondent was then working on probation, though the respondent alleged that his probation period was already over.  The appellant had also contended that the respondent teacher had offered his resignation voluntarily and his resignation was accepted.      The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the termination of the services of the respondent, without there being a valid inquiry was not proper and therefore, the termination of service of the respondent was set aside and he was ordered to be reinstated to the post of ’Teacher’ with full back wages from the date of his termination. The learned Single Judge before whom the matter came up for consideration held that once the Tribunal had come to a conclusion that no proper inquiry had been conducted in accordance with law, the matter should have been remitted back to an Inquiry Committee to decide the issue.  The learned Single Judge, therefore, framed certain issues and appointed a District Judge(Retd.) as Chairman of the Inquiry Committee.  One representative each from the appellant side and the respondent side were directed to be included in the Inquiry Committee and the Committee was directed to complete the inquiry within a period of six months. It was also directed that dismissal should be treated as suspension and suspension allowance shall be paid in accordance with law. The order of the learned Single Judge is challenged before us.

" SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI,J. Leave  is  granted.   The  appellant  and  the  second respondent  were  partners of partnership firm,  M/s.Jupiter Industries.   A complaint was lodged against the second  and third  respondents, FIR No.193, under Sections 405, 406  and 408, IPC at the Police Station, Mujessar, District Faridabad on  July  19,  1996.  A Civil Suit is  pending  between  the parties   for  dissolution  of   the  partnership  firm  and rendition  of accounts.  The said respondents filed Criminal Misc.Petition  24679-M  of  1997 before the  High  Court  of Punjab  & Haryana praying to quash the FIR.  The High  Court by  its  order dated April 17, 1998, having noticed  that  a Civil  Suit is pending between the parties and investigation on  the  complaint  of  the appellant by the  police  is  in progress,  stayed  the  filing  of the  final  report  under Section 173, Cr.P.C.  by the police.  It is from that order, this appeal has arisen. Heard the learned counsel for the parties. The relevant portion of the impugned order of the High Court reads as follows : ""In  view of the facts and circumstances of the  case, it  appears  to  be reasonable, if the filing of  the  final report  under  Section  173,  Cr.P.C.  is  stayed  till  the decision of the suit.  Ordered accordingly."" It  is now well-settled that the width of power of the High  Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C., in principle, is very expansive  but  in  practice  the   power  is  exercised  in exceptional  cases.  The inherent power of the Court is  not an unrestricted power to make any order which the High Court desires to pass.  The power is meant to be exercised to give effect  to  any order under Cr.P.C.  or to prevent abuse  of the  process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.   By passing the impugned order, the High Court did not  achieve any of the purposes for which the power exists. It does no good to anybody.  It is of utmost importance that criminal  cases be disposed of expeditiously as right of  an accused  to  have speedy trial is a right which  flows  from http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Article  21  of the Constitution.  Far from ensuring  speedy trial  the High Court placed embargo at the pre-trial  stage by  staying  the filing of final report by the police  under Section  173 Cr.P.C.  It is a well- known fact that disposal of a civil suit takes fairly long time, so no useful purpose will  be achieved by staying the filing of the final  report under  Section 173 Cr.P.C.  by the police till the  disposal of  the suit.  The impugned order serves no useful  purpose, nay,  it is wholly extraneous to the purposes for which  the power  is preserved.  In our view, it is most  inappropriate to  stay the filing of the final report by the police  under Section  173 Cr.P.C.  after the police has investigated  the case.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant.  The appellant faced trial for alleged commission of offence punishable under Section 376 , 324 read with Section 34 and 342 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short ’IPC’).    While the appellant was sentenced to undergo RI for 7 years, one year and six months respectively for the three offences, other accused persons were sentenced to undergo one year and six months for each of the offence i.e. Section 324 read with Section 34 and Section 342 read with Section 34 IPC. 3.      They preferred appeal before the High Court which was numbered as Criminal Appeal no.553 of 2001.  By the impugned order the conviction and sentence so far as the present appellant is concerned was confirmed while the sentences were reduced so far as the accused persons are concerned, but the fine amount was enhanced. 4.      The High Court by a practically non-reasoned order dismissed the appeal.  The only conclusion fathomable from the impugned judgment is as follows: ""3.     In fact the prosecution and the trial Court both have overlooked the fact that A1 had committed the acts of rape on two occasions which are distinct offences.  A1 should have been prosecuted separately for both the incidents of rape by filing separate charge sheet.  In respect of second incident of rape, the prosecution has adduced evidence to prove the guilt.  Accordingly, the trial Court rightly convicted the accused U/s. 376 IPC."" 5.      Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court while dealing with the appeal has not even analysed the evidence and has also not recorded any findings on various submission on behalf of the appellants. 6.      In response, learned counsel for the respondent-State http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 submitted that though the judgment of the High Court does not indicate the reasons, but the evidence on record justifies the ultimate conclusion that the appeal was to be dismissed. 7.      The manner in which the appeal has been dealt with is not a correct way to deal with the appeal.  No attempt appears to have been done by the High Court to appreciate the rival stand and to analyse the evidence in its proper perspective. 8.      Above being the position, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh disposal in accordance with law. 9.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Application for impleadment allowed. These appeals by special leave, arise from the judgment and orders  of the  Division Bench  of  the  Allahabad  High Court, made  on February  27, 1997 and March 2, 1997 in C.M. Application No.1255(w)/97  in Writ  Petition No.775(MB)  /97 and Writ Petition No.775/MB/97. It is  not  necessary  to  reiterate  all  the  factual details. Sufficer  it to  state that  the appellant had used the sugarcane  supplied by  the cane growers individually or through the  societies. As  a consequence,  we are informed, around Rs.29  crores are in arrears for payment to the cane- growers. The  Collector exercising  the  power  of  recovery proceedings has  attached the  sugar stock-in-hand;  against that, the  appellant filed  a writ  petition.  Pending  writ petition, the  High Court  has granted  certain  directions, which ultimately  could not  be complied with. Consequently, the interim directions stood vacated. Thus, these appeals by special leave. Having heard  the learned  counsel on  both  sides,  we think that the following order would meet the situation: (1)  The District  Collector, Bulandshahar  is  directed  to assess as  to what is the quantum of the Sugar stock-in-hand would be  sufficient to  meet the  payment of  price of  the sugarcane together  with interest  to all  the cane  growers towards the  sugarcane supplied by them for all the crushing seasons as  also the  Societies’ commission.  It would  be a first charge  and recordable  against the stock of sugar. On so assessing,  he would  permit the  appellant to  sell that quantum of  stock of  sugar. The sale proceeds thereof, when received from  the appellant, are directed to be credited to an account  to be  opened by the Collector in a nationalised Bank towards  this amount.  the  Collector  is  directed  to depute a  responsible officer  of  his  collectorate  to  be present at  the time  of sale. The officer would ensure that the sale  would be made only of the permitted stock and that the sale  proceeds are credited to the said account directed to be  opened in  that behalf.  On the amount directed to be opened in that behalf. On the amount being so deposited, the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 entire amount due shall Be paid to the cane growers. (2)  After the sale thus is effected and payment made to the cane growers,  it would  be open to the appellant to file an application before  the Collector  stating as to what amount it is liable to pay towards Excise Duty and arrears of wages to the employees etc. On the statement so made, the District Collector is directed to assess as to what quantity of sugar from  the  remaining  stock-in-hand  would  meet  the  above requirements; he would accordingly allow the release of that part  the  stock-in-hand  for  sale  by  the  appellant  for liquidation of Excise Duty, arrears of wages etc. The above exercise would be done within a period of two months from  the date of receipt of this order. In the event of  the   appellant  succeeding   in  the   writ   petition, appropriate directions may be given by the High Court in the main writ  petition for  mutual  adjustment  of  any  amount repayable by the cane growers. The order of attachment would stand lifted  after compliance of these directions. If there is any  difficulty in  the  implementation  of  this  order, liberty is  given to  the appellant  to approach this Court. Pending implementation of this order, we hope and trust that no further coercive steps will be taken and no officers, who are members  of the appellant-company or shareholders of the company, would be detained.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP)No.19385 of 2006) O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal by special leave is directed against the order dated     25th of September, 2006 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.M.No.9803 of 2006, by which the High Court had allowed an application filed under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking transfer of Civil Suit No.498 of 2004 (titled as Pritam Kaur vs. Iqbaljit Singh & Anr.) pending in the Court of Additional Civil Judge, (Senior Division), Faridabad, Haryana to the Civil Court at Chandigarh or Panchkula. Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the High Court, the present special leave petition has been filed in respect of which leave has already been granted. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the application under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the objections filed therein and other materials on record, we are of the view that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the reasons offered for transfer at the instance of the respondent could not be taken as a good ground for transferring the suit from Faridabad to Chandigarh. The suit, being No. 9803 of 2006, has been filed by Smt. Pritam Kaur, the respondent herein, before the Additional Court of the Civil Judge, (Senior Division) at Faridabad, Haryana in the year 2004. In the application for transfer, the ground for transferring the suit was that the respondent, being an old lady, was not in a position to pursue the case at Faridabad and, therefore, the suit be disposed of by the court at Chandigarh and not by the Court at Faridabad. It is true that the plaintiff-respondent is a resident of Chandigarh and aged about 75 years, even then, we are of the view that no ground has been made out for transfer of the suit from Faridabad to Chandigarh. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff-respondent herself had instituted the suit for declaration and injunction in the Faridabad Court and prosecuted the same for almost two years and only after the expiry of two years, the application was filed seeking transfer. In our view, the order of transfer passed by the High Court in the exercise of its power under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be sustained. It was the plaintiff-respondent, as noted herein above, who had filed the suit at Faridabad having jurisdiction to try the same and who had prosecuted the suit for about two years and then asked for transfer. Only because of the old age of the respondent, the suit could not have been transferred to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Chandigarh. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order and direct the trial court at Faridabad to decide the suit, positively within four months, without granting any unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties. Parties are directed to co-operate and we fix 7th of January, 2008 for appearance of the parties before the trial court at Faridabad either in person or through their counsel. It will be open to the parties to mention before us for further direction, if the suit is not disposed of within the time specified herein above. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. There will be no order as to costs.","This appeal by special leave is directed against the order dated    25th of September, 2006 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.M.No.9803 of 2006.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment and decree  dated October  22, 1993  of the  High  Court  of Himachal Pradesh  in RSA  No.261/92. Admitted facts are that when Om Dass, a Government servant died in harness, a prayer was made  to rehabilitate  one of the dependents. His widow, the appellant  herein laid  the claim  for appointment  as a Class IV  employee and  was so appointed . When her services were terminated  , she filed Suit No.6/88 filed in the court of Subordinate Judge, Mandi, H.P. and the Chief Judge by the judgment and  decree dated  November 30,  1989  decreed  the suit. On appeal, it was confirmed. But in the second appeal, the High  Court reversed  the decree primarily on the ground that in  the  enquiry  conducted  by  the  respondent  Board revealed that  the appellant  had married  Chandermani,  the brother of Om Dass, and she concealed the factum of marriage and the  birth of  a daughter. Therefore, she is not a widow of Om  Dass, the  deceased employee.  It was also found that she  gave  a  false  affidavit.  Consequently,  she  is  not entitled to the benefit of rehabilitation scheme. The question is whether the appellant had made any false statement. It  is clear  from the written statement filed by the respondent  in the  trial Court,  enclosing the  enquiry report submitted  by S.D.O.(c)  Chachiot ,that the appellant and her  husband Om Dass were living as members of the Hindu joint family with Chandermani, her brother-in-law, and other members. On enquiry , it was also revealed that the marriage between Chandermani and the appellant was not solemnised and a child was born to the latter. Under these circumstances, three crucial facts emerge. One,Chandermani, Om  Dass, the  appellant and  other members were living  together as  members of the Hindu joint family. Second, Om  Dass, the  Government servant , died in harness. Third, it  would appear  that after  the demise,  though the appellant was living with Chandermani, no legally solemnised http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 marriage took  place.  In  other  words,  they  were  living together as  man and woman and woman and a child was born to them. The question  which, therefore, emerges is whether the appellant made any false statement and whether she ceased to be widow  of Om  Dass. In  view of  the fact that no legally solemnised marriage  exists, she is not incorrect in stating that she  is the  widow of Om Dass. It is also revealed that since  they  are  the  members  of  the  joint  family,  her statement about  the dependence  is not  false. If these two facts are  excluded, there  is no other ground to disentitle her to  claim for  the benefit  of appointment  as  per  the rehabilitation scheme.  Accordingly, we  hold that  the High Court was  not right  in reversing  the decree  of the trial Court and the appellate Court and dismissing the suit. The appeal is allowed . The decree of the trial court is restored. However, the appellant will be entitled to back wages from  30.11.1989 only,  the date on which the suit was decreed.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. OF 1995 7871 OF 1995 [Arising out of SLP [C] No. 8589 of 1989 ] O R D E R Leave granted. The Court  of Civil  Judge in L.A.C. Nos. 263 and batch by award  and decree  dated 14th December, 1981 enhanced the compensation determined by the Land Acquisition Officer from Rs. 3,000/-  per acre  to Rs.  15,000/- per acre. On appeal, under Section  54 of  the Land  Acquisition Act  [for short, ’the Act’]  the IInd  Additional District  Judge, Belgaum by his common  judgment dated  24th August,  1983 confirmed the same. The  High Court  by  the  impugned  order  dated  29th January, 1988  in Miscellaneous Second Appeal No. 44 of 1985 and batch held that in determining compensation on the basis of the annual yield application of 15 years multiplier would be illegal,  as held  in Special  Land Acquisition  Officer, Davangere vs.  P. Veerabhadarappa etc. etc. [AIR 1984 SC 774 ]. As  for this decision, appropriate multiplier is 10. This view was reiterated in a number of decisions. However, the  learned Judge  declined to interfere with the order  on the  ground that  the land  in  acquisition in this case  was only  of an  extent of  38 gunthas and it was held that   ""it  is hardly appropriate to interfere with the award notwithstanding the discernible blemish pointed out by the learned  Government Pleader"".  The  learned  Judge  also applied the  provisions of  Sections 23 (1-A); 23 [2] and 28 of the  Act as  amended by  Amendment Act 68 of 1984 holding that it  would be subject to the result in Bhag Singh & Ors. vs. Union Territory of Chandigarh [(1985) 2 SCC 737 ]. Since on  merits, the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere with the determination of compensation applying 15 years multiplier,  the land in question being a small extent of land,  on facts of this case, we are also not inclined to upset the  wrong application  of law.  However, it would not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 operate as  a precedent  to any  future case  or other cases arising from  the same  notification. All  cases need  to be decided applying  only 10  years  multiplier.  However,  the claimants  are  not  entitled  to  the  benefits  under  the Amendment Act  68 of  1984. It  is settled  law that  if the claim is  pending before  the reference  Court on  or  after coming into force of the Amendment Act., viz., September 24, 1984, the  Amendment Act  gets attracted  for pending claims during that  interregnum. Since  the award  of the Reference Court is  of December 14, 1981, i.e., much prior to the date when the Land Acquisition Amendment Bill was introduced, the claimants are  not entitled  to 30  per cent solatium on the enhanced compensation,  additional amount  @ 12 per cent per annum of the enhanced compensation from the date of award or taking over  possession whichever is earlier and interest as provided in  the proviso to Section 28 of the Act as amended under Act  68 of  1984, i.e., 9 per cent for one year and 15 per cent  thereafter from the date of taking over possession till date  of deposit  or payment  whichever is earlier. But the  respondent-claimants   are  entitled  to  15  per  cent solatium  on  the  enhanced  compensation  and  5  per  cent interest per  annum on  the enhanced compensation as amended by the  local Act,  from the  date of taking over possession till the date of deposit or payment, whichever is earlier.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2976 OF 2008 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.6024/2007) Leave granted. This Civil Appeal is filed by the Department against the judgment and Order dated 17th October, 2005 passed by the Gujarat High Court in Tax Appeals Nos.240/2003 and 261/2003. We are  concerned  with the  block period 1-4-1988  to 24-2-1999.  The main contention advanced on behalf of the Department is that for allowance of deduction for depreciation, the asset must not only be owned by the assessee but it must also be used for the purposes of business or profession of the assessee.  It is the case of the Department that the word ""used"" in Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 refers to actual use of the asset.  It is the case of the Department that having regard to the scheme of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and, particularly, after the introduction of the concept of ""block of assets"", actual use is the only requirement apart from ownership for allowance of depreciation under Section 32.  It is the case of the Department that important question of law arose for determination before the High Court.  That, the High Court has failed to examine the said question and that it had erred in dismissing the Tax Appeals only on the ground that no substantial question of law had arisen. In the present case, the Tribunal has examined the statements of certain witnesses and after analysing the material on record, it has come to the conclusion on facts that there is nothing to show that the machinery, namely, expellers remained idle for the entire block period 1-4-1988 to 24-2-1999.  Having examined the record ourselves, we agree with the view expressed by the Tribunal on the facts of the present case.  Hence, it is not necessary for us to go into the larger question of law regarding the connotation of the word ""used"" appearing in Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. For the afore-stated reasons, Civil Appeal filed by the Department stands dismissed.  Question of law is kept open.

Notice to respondents 2 to 8 is accordingly dispensed with. 4. This appeal arises from an interim order of the order of the High Court. The Appellant herein has filed an appeal against the final decree in a suit for partition. In the said appeal, he sought stay of execution of the final decree, which required division of a commercial building which is in the occupation of the Appellant who is running a lodge therein. The High Court, considered the application for stay filed by the Appellant and made an order dated 1.9.2006 directing that the appeal itself should be listed for final hearing after Dassara Vacation and till then, the building shall not be demolished. 5. The said order is under challenge. The learned counsel for Appellant submits that he is in possession of the suit premises and his prayer was for interim stay of dispossession as he is running a lodge and an order of stay of demolition will not, therefore, protect his rights, pending appeal. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the first Respondent submitted that the Appellant has been enjoying the suit premises and though the first Respondent is entitled to two third share therein, he has been kept out of possession and he is also not receiving any income therefrom.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  is preferred  against the  judgment of the Bombay High  Court allowing  the writ  petition filed by the respondent. The writ petition was directed against the order of the  Assistant  Collector,  Customs  rejecting  a  refund application filed by the respondent. The respondent  had  imported  P.V.C.  resin  which  is liable to  payment of duty under tariff item No. 39.01/96 of the First  Schedule to  the Customs  Tariff Act,  1975.  The Central  Government   had,  however,   issued  an  exemption notification  providing  that  P.V.C.  resin  falling  under Chapter 39 when imported into India shall be exempt from the whole of  the  duty  of  customs  leviable  thereupon.  This notification dated  March 15,  1979  stated  that  it  shall remain in  operation till  March 31,  1981. On  October  16, 1980, however, the said notification was modified by another notification limiting the exemption to the duty in excess of forty percent  ad valorem.  The respondent,  it  is  not  in dispute, opened  the letters  of credit only on November 20, 1980, i.e.,  after the  issuance of  the notification  dated October 16,  1980. The  import was much later. Even so, they contended that they should get the benefit of full exemption of duty  as provided  by the  first notification dated March 15, 1979  and that  the notification  dated October 16, 1980 cannot be  applied to  him. This  contention was rejected by the Assistant Collector but the High court has upheld the same. An identical  dispute has  been pronounced upon by this Court in  Kasinka Trading  & Anr. etc. v. Union India & Anr. [J.T.1994 (7)  362]. The said decision deals with these very notifications. Indeed,  that was  a case where the appellant had placed  orders for the import of P.V.C. resin before the issuance of notification dated October 16, 1980. Even so, it was held that he cannot plead promissory estoppel nor can he claim full exemption under notification dated March 15, 1979 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ignoring the  later notification.  The case  before us  is a clearer one  in the  sense that  the opening  of letters  of credit and  the  transaction  was  entered  into  after  the issuance  of   the  notification  dated  October  16,  1980. Following the  said decision - and also having regard to the aforementioned factual  position -  this appeal  is allowed. The judgment of the High Court is set aside.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO 1904 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.7777/2006) Leave granted. Respondent, (hereinafter referred to as ’the workman’), was engaged on 05.05.1999 as Chowkidar  in the Department of District Food and Supplies Controller, Fatehabad (Haryana).  His services according to the appellant-management, (hereinafter referred to as ’the Management’), were terminated  on 29.02.2000 whereas according to the workman his services were terminated on 16.04.2000 as he continued to discharge his duties till 15.4.200 0. He served a demand notice under Section 2-A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short ’the Act’) demanding reinstatement in service with continuity of the service and full back wages.  Conciliation efforts were made but as they did not succeed, a reference was made by the Management to the labour Court for adjudication of the following dispute: ""Whether the termination of services of Madan Lal is justified and valid?  If not, alongwith reinstatement, to what amount of back wages, he is entitled to?"" On the pleadings of the parties, the following five issues were framed: ""1.As per terms of reference? 2.      Whether the reference is bad for misjoinder and non-joinder of necessary parties? 3.      Whether the petitioner has no locus-standi? 4.      Whether Respondent Department is not ’industry’? 5.      Relief."" During the course of arguments, issues Nos. 1 & 3 were only pressed.  Issue Nos. 2 & 4 were not pressed. According to the workman, he had worked for 240 days and his services had been termi nated without complying with the mandatory provisions of Section 25F of the Act. As against this, the case put forth by the Management was that the workman had worked only for 220 days i.e. from 8.5.1999 to 29.02.2000 whereas according to the workman he had worked up to 15.4.2000.  The workman produced a copy of the duty roster as exhibit W4 running into 23 pages.  As per this document, the workman had worked up to 15.04.2000.  MW1 Bir Singh, District Food & Supply Controller, Fatehabad in his cross-examination  admitted that the department was maintaing t http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 he duty roster in respect of chowkidars.  In spite of being asked to produce the original duty roster, Management did not produce the original duty roster. The labour court drew an adverse inference against the management and held that the workman had worked for more than 240 days and his services had been terminated without complying wit h the mandatory provisions of Section 25F of the Act.  Accordingly, the labour court answered the reference in favour of the workman and against the management and directed reinstatement wit h continuity and all other consequential service benefits along with 50% back wages. Management, being aggrieved, filed writ petiion in the High Court which has been dis missed by the impugned order. The High Court has passed a detailed order affirming the findings record ed by the labour court.  The findings recorded by the courts below are findings of fact which d o not call for interference.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Application for impleadment is rejected. We  have  heard  Shri  Venugopals  learned  senior counsel    for  the  appellant  and  also  the  learned counsel,  Shri   Vaidyanathan,   on   behalf   of   the intervenor-said to  be devotee.  The Division  Bench of the Kerala  High Court in the impugned order has stated that on  November 2,  1995, the Court had chalked out a programme to  conduct the  examinations and  interviews for  selection  of  the  candidates  to  the  posts  of lower/upper division  clerks in Guruvayoor Dewaswom and the C.M.P.  has been filed for direction to entrust the duty of setting out and printing of the question papers for the  written test.  After hearing  the counsel, the Court was  of the  view that  the  said  responsibility could safely  be  entrusted  to  the  Administrator  or Guruvayoor Devaswom.  Accordingly the Administrator was directed to  get the  question paper  set by  competent persons with  utmost secrecy.  The Court  also directed the Administrator  to get them printed for distribution only at  the examination  center on  the  date  of  the written test.  Subsequently, on  November  2,  1995  it directed the  conduct  of  interviews  by  a  committee consisting of  the Chairman,  the Administrator and Mr. M. Gopalan,  member  of  Guruvayoor  Devaswom  Managing Committee and  a practicing advocate of the High Court. The Director of Training, High Court was directed to be as observer  in the  interview In  the  impugned  order dated 2.11.1995, the High Court has replaced Gopalan as member of  the committee  and ordered that the Director should be  one of  the members  of the  Committee. This later order is now impugned in this appeal. When the  matter had  come  up  on  12.1.1996  for admission, the devotee sought to intervene. We directed him to  file an  affidavit whether any allegations have http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 been made  against Mr.  Gopalan in  the High  Court for being replaced with the Director and accordingly he had taken time.  Today, we  are  informed  that  though  an affidavit has  been prepared, that is not reflective of correct facts and counsel had some contra coral instructions. We deprecate this tendency to file an affidavit and to give oral contra instructions.Party must state  true and correct facts in the affidavit and should stand  by them  and take  orders from the Court. Obviously, Shri  Vaidyanathan has  correctly taken  the responsibility in  not filing  that affidavit  which is inconsistent with  the oral  instructions. The  devotee does not  have the  courage to make allegations against Gopalan. Under  these circumstances,  we proceed on the footing that  no allegations  have  been  made  against Gopalan for  his being  replaced with  the Director,  a Judicial offence. Shri Venugopal is right in his contention  that it would  be  salutary  to  leave  the  selection  to  the Selection committee  constituted to conduct the written test  and  interview  of  the  candidates  without  any involvement or active participation by the judicial arm of the  Court in  the process  of selection.  It is not proper for  the Court to associate itself with the said process of  conducting the  examinations by  nominating its judicial  officer  in  the  process  of  selection. Otherwise, the  Court itself  would come into criticism for associating  its officers  with  selection  of  the candidates, in  the event  of allegations  made against the  said  selections.  We  find  great  force  in  the contention   of    Shri    Venugopal.    Under    those circumstances, associating  a judicial officer with the selection is  not conducive  and proper. In the absence of any allegation against Gopalan and any indication to that effect  in the  order of  the High Court, we think that the  High Court  was not justified in removing him from the Committee. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed,  but  in  the circumstances. without costs.","The Division  Bench of the Kerala High Court in the impugned order has stated that on  November 2, 1995, the Court had chalked out a programme to conduct the examinations and interviews for  selection  of  the  posts of lower/upper division clerks in Guruvayoor Dewaswom.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(4) SCR 292 The following Order of the Court was delivered : This appeal arises from the judgement of a Division Bench of the High Court at Bombay passed in Sales Tax Reference No. i of 1995 dated 22nd February, 1995. the Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal referred the following question Under Section 61(1) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 (for short, ’the Act’) to the High Court: ""Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and on a true and correct interpretation of the provision of Section 2(17) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, was the Tribunal justified in holding that crushing of boulders resulting in metal of different sizes ordinarily Known as ’Gitti’ does not amount to manufacture?"" The facts, insofar as they are relevant for our purpose are as follows: The assessee purchases big sized stones-boulders from registered dealers and crushes them into small sizes, Known as ’Gitti’. It approached the Commissioner of Sales Tax for determination of the question whether converting bigger size boulders into ’gitti’ would amount to manufacture. The Deputy Commissioner held that the process of conversion amounts to ’manufacture’ within the meaning of Section 2(17) of the Act, Against the order of the Deputy Commissioner, the assessee went in appeal before the Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal. The contention of the assessee that converting boulders into ’gitti’ does not involve any manufacturing process within the meaning of the Act, was accepted by the Tribunal, From that order, the afore-mentioned question was referred to the High Court at Bombay. Following the judgements of this Court in Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax v, Pio Food Packers, (46 S.T.C. 63). Chowgule & Co. Pvt. ltd. and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors., (47 S.T.C, 124) and Sterling Foods v. Stale of Karnataka and Ors., (63 S.T.C. 239), the High Court held that the conversion of boulders into,’ gitti did not amount to manufacture’. It is this view of the High Court that is assailed in this appeal by the Revenue. Section 2(17) of the Act defines the term ’manufacture’ and it reads thus: ""Manufacture with al! the grammatical variations and cognate expressions means producing, making, extracting, alternating ornamenting, finishing or otherwise processing, treating or adapting any goods but does not include such manufacture or manufacturing processes as may be prescribed."" From a perusal of the definition, extracted above, it is clear that the processes of producing, making, extracting, alternating ornamenting, finishing or otherwise processing, treating or adapting of any goods fall within the meaning of the term ’manufacture’.. But it may be pointed out that every type of variation of the goods or finishing of goods would not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 amount to manufacture unless it results in emergence of new commercial commodity, In the instant case, the very nature of the activity does not result in manufacture because no new commercial commodity comes into existence. This Court in Commissioner of Sales Tax, Uttar Pradesh v. Lal Kunwa Stone Crusher (P.) Ltd., [2000] 3 SCC 525, on an identical question, expressed the view that when stone boulders were crushed into stone chips, gitti and stone ballast, the process could not be termed as ’manufacture’. That case arose under the Uttar Pradesh Sates Tax Act, 1948 (for short, ’the Act’), The definition of manufacture’ in Section 2(e-l) of the U.P. Act appears to be similar to the definition under consideration. In view of the judgement of this Court in Lal Kunwa Stone Crasher (P.) Ltd (supra), with which we are in respectful agreement, we find no illegality in the impugned judgment of the High Court. In the view that we have taken, the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Kher Stone Crusher v, General Manager, District Industries Centre, Jabalpur and Am., (79 S.T.C. 149) cannot be treated as good law. The Civil appeal is, therefore, dismissed, No costs.","High Court of India dismisses Revenue's appeal against Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS.2204-2205  OF 2002 We have heard, Ms. Madhusmita Bora, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. T. Harish Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent at length. The appellant, a boy when aged about 20 years met with a fatal vehicle accident on 26.06.1997. He  sustained the following bodily injuries : i.      Amputation of the right leg leaving 10cms. from the hip. ii.     Multiple compound fracture in the left leg knee and in the ankle. iii.    Severe injury to the head leading to a          state of unconsciousness. iv.     Severe injury in the left hand palm v.      Skin grafting done in the left leg vi.     Severe internal injuries. : 2 : Doctor certified that he sustained 100% permanent physical disability. It is not disputed that at the time of accident the appellant was working as a mason and he was earning Rs.3,000/- per month. The Tribunal by its order awarded Rs.75,000/- for loss of marital alliance. The Tribunal also awarded Rs.25,000/- towards inability to participate in family and social functions. The Tribunal also awarded Rs. 75,000/- towards pain and suffering due to fracture in his left leg and amputation of his right leg. The Tribunal further awarded Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for loss of earning power as against the claim of Rs.11,00,000/-.  All together the Tribunal has awarded Rs.5,25,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum. On appeal being preferred by the appellant the High Court has enhanced to Rs.5,29,948/-. However, the High Court has reduced the rate of interest from 12% per annum to 9% per annum. Admittedly, the claimant had suffered grievous injuries out of the motor accident and amputation of the right leg leaving 10 cms. from the hip. It is also in the evidence on record that the claimant also suffered multiple compound fracture in the left leg knee and in the ankle amongst other injuries.  He has been totally incapacitated for future earning power.  His dream of having a married life has been shattered. : 3 : Considering the aforesaid circumstances we add Rs.1,00,000/- more under the head of loss of earning power. Under that heading we enhance from Rs.1,00,000/- awarded by the Tribunal to Rs.2,00,000/-. The other sum awarded by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court is not disturbed. With the aforesaid enhancement the appeals are partly allowed.","The appellant, a boy when aged about 20 years met with a fatal vehicle accident on 26.06.1997.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.3389 OF 2002 1.      This appeal by special leave arises out of an order of the High Court of Gujrat at Ahmedabad wherein the issue was of vacation of order of injunction after notice which was granted by the trial court at the ex parte stage relating to trade mark/name and passing of the medicine of the appellant ""ATORVA"" by the medicine of the respondent ""ATOR"" for the same treatment. 2.      Initially, an interim order was granted by the trial court against which the appeal was taken. The appeal was, however, admitted by the appellate authority but it refused to grant any interim order during the pendency of the appeal. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant before us filed an appeal before the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad which by the impugned order refused to grant any interim order to the appellant, but direction was made to proceed with the suit and dispose of the same at an early date. It is this order of the High Court which was challenged in this Court by way of a special leave petition. While issuing notice on 15th of March, 2008, this Court passed the following order:- ""Exemption allowed. Issue notice. In the meantime, we pass an ad-interim injunction n in terms of para 17(a) of  the application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, filed  before  the Ahmedabad City Civil Court which reads as follows: (a) restrain by an order of ad-interim injunction the defendants, their servants, agents, stockists, or others directly or indirectly  involved from in any manner using in relation to any medicinal or  pharmaceutical preparation in manufacturing or marketing the pharmaceutical product bearing  the   trademark  ATOR  or  any other trade mark which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s trademark."" 3.      The interim order granted by this Court was made absolute on 6th of May, 2002 and at the same time leave was also granted. This is how the matter has come up for hearing before us for final disposal. 4.      Mr.C.A.Sundaram, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits on instruction that the respondents are now using the name http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of their medicine as ""ATORIL"" and not ""ATOR"" in respect of which this court in the year 2002 had granted injunction restraining the respondent from using the said name till the disposal of the appeal which is still now continuing. Since the interim order granted by this Court is still continuing for the last six years and considering the other facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the appeal which was filed and still pending before the  appellate  court  practically  has  now become infructuous. Accordingly, the appeal before the appellate court is disposed of as infructuous. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct the trial court to decide the suit as early as possible preferably within a period of one year from the date of communication of this order. It is needless to say that the interim order granted by this Court shall continue till the disposal of the suit.  We make it clear that we have not gone into the merits as to whether the appellant was or is at all entitled to an order of injunction in the application for injunction. 5.      Accordingly, this appeal is disposed of with the above direction. There will be no order as to costs.","An interim order was granted by the trial court against which the appeal was taken.

The writ  petitioners in  the High Court as well as the State have come up in these appeals. It is not necessary for us  to  elaborate  all  the  material  facts  and  also  the contentions advanced  in the High Court. Suffice it to state that the  High Court  of Patna  in the  impugned order dated November 21,  1995 in CWJC Nos. 2093/89 and 3072/90 directed the Government  to identify  the vacancies  existing  as  on December 31,1987  and available  for appointment  from among the candidates  in the  waiting list  as recommended  by the Public  Service   Commission  to   the  Assistant  Engineers (Civil). The  High Court  also  found  that  the  200  posts earmarked by  the Government  in their resolution dated June 16, 1987  were intended  for Engineers  in Rural Engineering Organization but  the writ  petitioners have  no right to be appointed up to those posts from the wait listed candidates. Shri  Gopal   Subramaniam,   learned   senior   counsel appearing for  the writ petitioners contended that since the Public Service  Commission had  rejected the  request of the State Government  to regularize  the employees holding these 200 posts  in the Government Resolution dated June 16, 1987, those posts  should be] made available to the candidates who are wait  listed. We  find no force in the contention. It is seen that those 200 posts are meant to the Rural Engineering Organization and  not  for  Road/Building  Construction  and Public Works  Department.  Under  those  circumstances,  the necessary consequence  would be  that those 200 posts should be made  available for direct recruitment through the Public Service Commission  and the  eligible candidates would apply for and get the selection according to rules for appointment http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to those  posts. It  would be  open to the employees also to apply for direct recruitment and seek selection according to rules. With regard to the direction given by the High Court to identify the  existing vacancies  as on  December 31 1987 as per the  Resolution of the Government for being filled up by the wait  listed candidates,  we find  no exception  to  the direction given  by the High Court, on the peculiar facts in this case.  It is  true that the court cannot give direction to fill  up vacancies  from the waiting list after the lapse of one  year. But  in this  case, the  High Court  had given exception to  the  principle.  An  interim  direction  given earlier to keep the waiting list alive was in operation till the disposal  of the  writ petition. The High Court has also found that  on the  basis of  the material on record, it was not possible  for the  court to record any finding as to the number of  vacancies existing  as on December 31, 1987 so as to give direction to fill up those posts from the candidates available in the waiting list. It is  then contended  for the  State that  a  positive stand taken  and the  material placed  before the High Court was that the vacancies meant for the general candidates have already been  filled up  and that  there were  no  vacancies existing as  on that  date. It  is true  that the  State has taken that  stand. But the High Court did not feel satisfied to accept  the Government’s  contention that  no posts  were available for  appointment. Under  those  circumstances,  it would be  for the  Government to  make  afresh  exercise  to identify whether  there exist  vacancies  meant  either  for general candidates  or for  the reserved  candidates and, if so, how  many of  them  do  exist  so  as  to  fill  up  the vacancies, if  so identified, from among the candidates from waiting list  If the  Government finds  that  there  are  no vacancies existing,  the Government  would place a report in this behalf before the High Court accordingly. The appeals  are dismissed with the above observations. No costs.","The High Court of Patna in the impugned order dated November 21, 1995 in CWJC Nos. 2093/89 and 3072/90 directed the Government to identify the vacancies.

" O R D E R Substitution allowed. This Court while disposing of the matter by order dated July 20,  1988 directed  that depending upon the decision of the Constitution  Bench in Union of India vs. Raghubir Singh [(1989) 3 SCR 316], the payment of the interest and solatium would be  determined. Since there the Constitution Bench had concluded that  the  claimants  would  be  entitled  to  the statutory benefits  under Amendments  Act 60  of 1984 if the proceedings are  pending before the Land Acquisition Officer or Civil  Court between  April  30,  1984,  i.e.,  when  the Amendment Act  68 of 1984 was introduced on the floor of the Parliament and  the date  when the  Act came  into force  in September 24, 1984. Admittedly, the award came to be made on August 30,  1982 and  the supplementary award with regard to the trees etc., came to be made on December 27, 1982. Under these  circumstances, the  petitioners  would  be entitled to  payment of  solatium under Section 23 [2] @ 30% per annum  on enhanced  compensation. As regards the payment of interest  under Section  28 of  the Land  Acquisition At, 1894 and  the additional  amount under  Section 23  [1-A] of that Act, admittedly, the petitioners remained in possession of the  acquired land.  Under Sections  34, 28  and 23 [1-A] payment of  interest and  additional amount  was intended to mitigate the  hardship caused to the owner by deprivation of enjoyment of  their property,  after possession  was  taken.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. This appeal by  special leave  arises from  the order dated March 18, 1994  made by  the  learned  single  Judge  in  Revision Petition No.604  of 1993.  The appellants had terminated the service of the respondent on December 7, 1983. On appeal, it was confirmed. When a suit was filed, the District Munsif by decree dated  November 12,  1990, declared that the order of termination as  well as the order of the appellate authority were illegal,  void and  against the  principle  of  natural Justice. The respondent had filed Execution Petition No.2/91 for  reinstatement.   The  executing   Court  dismissed  the Execution Application  on December 4, 1992 holding that suit of the  plaintiff against the respondent is for declaration. Therefore, he  is not  entitled  to  the  back-wages.  On  a revision filed,  the High Court relying upon the decision of the High  Court in  Rajasthan State  Road Transport Corpn. & Ors. vs.  Sohan Lal  [S.B.C.R. No.623/93]  decided  on  26th October, 1993 set aside the order of the executive Court and directed payment  of the  back-wages. Thus  this  appeal  by special leave. It is  not in  dispute that the decree does not contain payment of  back-wages. Only  declaratory  relief  has  been granted. Shri  Gaur, the  learned counsel  appearing for the respondent contended  that when the batch was disposed of by this Court  on December  16, 1994,  this Court  had directed payment  of   40%  of  the  back-wages.  The  respondent  is accordingly entitled  to the  same relief.  We find from the order of  this Court  that there  as no  such indication. It would appear  that in some cases, there was a declaration to grant consequential monetary reliefs. In the batch when this Court had  disposed of  the matters  obviously the relief of back-wages related  to those cases. Consequently, this Court limited payment  of back-wages  to the  extent of 40%. It is settled law  that  executing  Court  cannot  go  behind  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 decree. In view of the fact that the decree contained only a declaratory relief  without  any  consequential  payment  of monetary benefits, the executing Court was right in refusing to grant  the relief. The High Court was, therefore, clearly in error in directing payment of back-wages. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","The appellants terminated the service of the respondent on December 7, 1983. On appeal, it was confirmed. When a suit was filed, the District Munsif by decree dated November 12, 1990, declared that the order of termination as well as the order  were illegal,  void and against the principle  of natural Justice.

Sharma,  Mrs.  Shobha Dikshit, R.C.  Gubrela, K.R.  Gupta and  R.K. Sharma for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J.  The appellant has questioned in this appeal by  special leave the constitutional validity of sub- section (4)  of section  6 of  the U.P. Industrial Disputes, Act, 1947  (hereinafter referred  to as  ’the Act’) and also the validity  of the  Order dated December 5, 1984 passed by the Government of Uttar Pradesh remitting an award passed by the Labour Court, Meerut for reconsideration by it. The appellant  was an  employee of the Management, M/s. Electra (India)  Ltd., Meerut-Respondent  No. 5 in the above appeal. The services of the appellant were terminated by the Management by  its Order  dated April  4, 1977  and the said termination  led   to  an   industrial  dispute.  The  State Government by its Order dated May 5, 1979 made under section 4-K of the Act referred the said dispute for adjudication to the Labour Court, Meerut. The question which was referred to the Labour Court read as follows: ""Whether the termination/removal from work of the employee  Shri B.P. Rajwanshi by the employers by their  Order dated 4.4.1977 is justified and/or legal? If not, to 474 what benefits/damages  is the  concerned  employee entitled to and with what other details?"" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 5 On the basis of the pleadings filed by the parties, the following issues were framed by the Labour Court: 1. Was  Shri  B.B.  Rajwanshi  not  a  workman  as defined in  the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act? If so has this court jurisdiction to try this case? 2. Did  Shri B.B.  Rajwanshi not  make efforts  to minimise the losses due to unemployment? 3. To  what relief, if any, is Shri B.B. Rajwanshi entitled? 4. Has Shri B.B. Rajwanshi been retrenched? If so, how does it affect the case? After recording the evidence adduced by the parties and hearing the  arguments the  Labour Court  held, (i) that the appellant was a workman as defined in the Act, (ii) that the termination of the services of the appellant was illegal and (iii) that  the appellant  was entitled  to be reinstated in his post  with continuity of service and also to the payment of  backwages   and  other   benefits.  The   Labour   Court accordingly passed  an award on August 2, 1984 and forwarded it to  the State Government. Instead of publishing the award in the  Official Gazette,  as required by sub-section (3) of section 6  of the  Act, the State Government passed an Order dated December  5, 1984  under section 6(4) of the Act which read as follows: ""GOVERNMENT OF UTTAR PRADESH","The appellant was an employee of the Management, M/s.

" O R D E R The appeal  upon certificate  impugns a  judgment of  a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court. The respondent had imported miniauthorised switches for use in  electronic hearing  aids which  it manufactured.  lt appears that  there are  two types  ot  such  switches,  the conventional one  then being  wafer switches  and the other, newly innovated, being reed switches. It was the latter type of switch  which was  imported. The Customs authorities took the view  that the respondents’ import licence did not cover reed switches and they were not entitled to the concessional rate of  import duty.  The stand  of the Customs authorities was, ultimately,  assailed in the writ petition filed by the respondent before  the High  Court. The  Writ  petition  was allowed. An  appeal was  preferred and it is the Judgment in appeal which is under challenge before us. The High  Court in  the impugned  order noted  that the stand  of   the  Customs  authorities  was  that  the  words ""switches, miniauthorised""  as component  parts  of  hearing aids should  be understood  to  mean  only  those  types  of switches which  were generally  used in  the manufacture  of hearinq aids at the time of publication of the Import Policy for the  relevant year,  namely 1977,  and that  these words could not  be said  to include any other type of switch even if  such   other  type  of  switch  could  be  used  in  the manufacture of hearing aids. The Division Bench observed, in our view,  very rightly,  that such  an interpretation over- looked that  industry was  not static  and  that  there  was continuous technical progress therein. New processes and new methods developed  from time  to time  and new  material and components or  types of components superseded others. lt was unreasonable to  give a  static interpretation to words used in a tariff schedule ignoring the rapid march of technology. Having regard  to the  technical opinion  that reed swithces would improve  the performance  of hearing  aids,  the  Hiqh http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court held  that reed  switches were  covered by  the tariff entry. The High Court also noted that it was not the case of the Customs  authorities that  the respondent  was trying to divert the  imported reed  switches from  the manufacture of hearing aids to another purpose. We do  not think  that we  can put  it better. Progress cannot be  stifled by an over-rigid interpretation of lmport Policy or Customs tariff. Both must be read as they stand on the date  of importation  and whatever is reasonably covered thereby must  be allowed  to be  imported regardless  of the fact that  it was not in existence or even contemplated when the policy or tariff was formulated. The appeal  is dismissed.  The bank  guarantee given by the respondent  pursuant to  the order  of this  Court dated 25.3.83 shall  stand discharged.  There shall be no order as to costs.",The appeal  upon certificate impugns a judgment of  a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      A two judge Bench doubted the correctness of some of the observations made in Moreshwar Balkrishna Pandare & Ors. v. Vithal Vyanku Chavan and Ors. [2001(5) SCC 551] and therefore referred the matter to a larger Bench and that is how the matter was posted before us.  The essence of the judgment in Moreshwar\022s case (supra) was that once an action in Section 31-B is taken, Section 88C of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (in short the \021Act\022) has no relevance. 2.      In the instant case, the original owner had expired. Undoubtedly, the certificate had been issued to him under Section 88-C with reference to the qualification possessed by the landlord as on 1st April, 1957. The question which fell for consideration before the High Court was the effect of the death of the original landlord who had either applied for issuance of certificate under Section 88-C, which is pending, or was the certificate already granted in his favour.  In Paragraph 27 of Moreshwar\022s case (supra) it is held that once certificate under Section 88-C is issued and the landlord has issued notice in exercise of the rights under Section 33-B of the Act and proceeds to file an application for possession under Section 33- B read with Section 29 of the Act, the relief under Section 88-C gets exhausted. Moreshwar\022s case (supra) related to rights under Section 88D of the Act. The question which may arise is that when death has taken place whether the income or the extent of land of the legal heirs have to be reckoned. 3.      Sections 33-B and 88-C operate in different fields. Bona fide requirement and personal cultivation concepts are applicable only under Section 88-C because it refers to Section 33-B. Section 33-B refers to bona fide requirement and personal cultivation. Section 88D(iv) comes into operation when the annual income exceeds the limit fixed and/or economic holdings exceeded. There are two separate stages. The tenant can, in a given case, oppose the application in terms of Section 33-B on the ground that there is no bona fide requirement and/or personal cultivation. It deals with enforcement of the certificate. With the death of the original landlord, the question of economic holding and the income also becomes relevant. In Section 33-B income and/or economic holding concept is not there. 4.      The decision in Moreshwar\022s case (supra) is accordingly clarified.  We remit the matter to the High Court to hear the writ http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 petitions afresh in the light of the position of law delineated above. 5.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court upholding the conviction of appellants as done by learned Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No.25/1984 for offence punishable under Sections 342, 365 and 330 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’). Learned Single Judge observed that conviction was not questioned and what was submitted related to quantum of sentence.  The High Court noted that he required learned counsel appearing for the appellants to address the Court on question of conviction, which was denied.  Only quantum of sentence aspect was highlighted.  The High Court felt that in view of the concessions made relating to the conviction, the sentence cannot be held to be disproportionate keeping in view the nature of the offence. 2.      Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that there appears to be some confusion because there was never any instruction given by the appellants not to question the conviction as recorded. In fact, according to them, the conviction was without any material and basis. 3.      Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted that having conceded before the High Court that the conviction was in order, the present appeal is mis- conceived. 4.      If really there was no concession, the only course open to the appellants was to move the High Court in line with what has been said in State of Maharashtra v. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak and Anr (1982 (2) SCC 463). In  Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill Pvt. Ltd. and Ors (2002 AIR SCW 4939) the view in the said case was reiterated by observing that statements of fact as to what transpired at the hearing, recorded in the judgment of the Court, are conclusive of the facts so stated and no one can contradict such statements by affidavit or other evidence. If a party thinks that the happenings in Court have been wrongly recorded in a judgment, it is incumbent upon the party, while the matter is still fresh in the minds of the Judges, to call the attention of the very Judge who has made the record. That is the only way to have the record corrected. If no such step is taken, the matter must necessarily end there. It is not open to the appellants to contend before this Court to the contrary. 5.      We, therefore, decline to interfere in the matter. However, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 we make it clear that if any motion is made before the High Court as to the claim that no concession was made, the same shall be considered in the proper perspective in accordance with law. 6.      The appeal is accordingly dismissed.","The appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court upholding the conviction of appellants.

" CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No.  20 of 1977. Appeal  by Special Leave from the Judgment   and   Order dated  28-2-75 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in  Crl.  A. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 No. 462 of 1973. S.C. Agarwala and A.P. Gupta for the Appellants. P.P. Rao, G.N. Rao and T.V.S.N. Chari for the Respondent. ’The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KHANNA,  J. This appeal by special leave is against  the judgment  of  the Andhra Pradesh High Court  dismissing  the appeal filed by the appellants. The appellants were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge Visakhapatnam for offences under sections 147, 148 and 352  Indian  Penal Code.  Some of the appellants  were  also convicted  for  offences under section 5  of  the  Explosive Substances Act and section 25 of the Indian Arms Act.   They were  sentenced  to various terms of  imprisonment  and  the sentences  were  ordered  to run  concurrently.   The  total sentence  of  imprisonment to be undergone by  some  of  the appellants was 600 two  years while in the case of the other appellants it  was one year. The appellants went up in appeal to the High Court against  the  judgment of the trial court.  The  High  Court referred to the fact that the appellants had been in custody during  the course of the investigation, inquiry and  trial, for about two years. The appellants were held entitled under section  428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to  set off  the period of detention against the sentence of impris- onment  imposed  upon them.  The High Court in view  of  the above  dismissed  the  appeal after observing  that  it  was unnecessary to go into the matter as it would be only of  an academic interest. We  have heard Mr. Agarwala on behalf of the  appellants and  Mr. Rao on behalf of the State, and are of the  opinion that  the  judgment of the High Court in so far  as  it  has refrained  from going into the merits of the  conviction  of the  appellants, cannot be sustained;  The fact that a  con- victed  person  has  already undergone the  sentence  or  is otherwise  entitled  to  be set at liberty  because  of  the length  of the period during which he has been under  deten- tion  during the course of investigation, inquiry and  trial cannot prevent the said person from challenging his  convic- tion in appeal.   Conviction for an offence entails  certain consequences.  Conviction also carries with it a stigma  for the convicted person. A convicted person in challenging  his conviction. in appeal not only seeks to avoid undergoing the punishment  imposed upon him as a result of the  conviction, he also wants that other evil consequences flowing from  the conviction  should not visit him and that the  stigma  which attaches  to him because of the conviction should be’  wiped out. In case the convicted person undergoes the sentence  of imprisonment imposed upon him or he is otherwise entitled to be set at liberty by the time his appeal against  conviction comes up for hearing in view of the length of the period  he was in detention during the course of investigation, inquiry or trial, such a person would still be entitled to challenge his  conviction.   The fact that he is set  at  liberty  and would not have to undergo any further sentence of  imprison- ment  would not debar him from questioning the  validity  of his  conviction.  The object of such a challenge to  convic- tion is to avoid the other consequences flowing from convic- tion and also to erase the stigma resulting from the convic- tion..  The High Court, in our view, was in error in so  far as it declined to go into the validity of the conviction  of the appellants. We,  therefore,  remand the case to the High  Court  for disposing of the appeal of the appellants on merit. S.R.                  Appeal allowed and case remanded. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 601","Appellants were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge Visakhapatnam for offences under sections 147, 148 and 352 of the Indian Penal Code.

" J U D G M E N T B.P. SINGH,J. Heard counsel for the parties. This appeal is against an interim order of the High Court whereby in a pending Second Appeal the High Court directed the respondent to deposit the rent at the rate of Rs.1250/- per month from 1.5.1993 and at the rate of Rs.2000/- per month with effect from January 1, 1999 till the disposal of the Second Appeal. The grievance of the appellant is that the land which was leased out in the year 1973 for a period of 20 years for setting up a Petrol Station  is being utilised by the respondent for parking of vehicles which gives to the respondent an earning of Rs.1000/- per day.   Therefore, the appellant prayed before the High Court that during the pendency of the appeal respondent should be directed to deposit by way of rent a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the order of the Central  Administrative Tribunal,   Bhubaneshwar  Bench, made on  June 17,  1996 in  QA No.875/94.  Applications were invited for  recruitment to  the post of Senior Auditor. The petitioner who  at the  relevant time  was working on ad hoc also  applied  for  selection  to  the  said  post.  In  the selection,  three  candidates,  viz.,  S.  Sahu  With  Post- Graduation  in   Commerce  Rao   with   graduation   Honours Commerces and  the petitioner  With graduation  in commerce. Sahu secured  in viva   voce 17 marks; minimum qualification would secured 2 marks whereas post-graduation would secure 5 marks out  of the total 24 marks. Rao secured 15-1/2 in viva voce, 2  marks for  graduation, 3  marks for  graduation  in Hononours amounting to total of 20-1/2 marks. The petitioner secured  18   marks  in  viva  voce,  2  marks  in  commerce graduation amount to the total of 20 marks. Thus Sahu having secured highest  marks came  to be  selected. Impugning  the selection, the  petitioner filed  OA in  the  Tribunal.  The Tribunal  rejected  the  same  holding  that  the  procedure adopted was valid in law and no interference is called for. Shri H.K.  Puri, learned  counsel for  the  petitioner, contended that  Rule 6  of Schedule I to the Orissa Auditors Service Method  of  Recruitment  &  Conditions  of  Service) Rules, 1987 provides that no extra weightage should be given to the marks for academic qualification and that, therefore, the award  of the  marks to Sahu and Rao for post-graduation in Commerce  and Commerce  Hononours is  illegal. We find no force in  the contention.  Clause (6)  of Schedule  I to the abovesaid Rules reads as under: "" 6.  Academic qualification  - The marks  secured   from  High  School Certificate examination  to  degree examination shall  be the basis for awarding  the  marks  for  academic qualification. No  weightage  shall be  given  to  higher  examinations http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 which  the   candidate  might  have passed. The  marks  obtained  by  a candidate    in     the    academic qualification test  shall be  added to the marks obtained by him in the test and  the aggregate so obtained shall determine  his position inter se  in   the  select   list  to  be prepared by the Selection Board."" A reading  of it would indicate that the marks  secured from  High  School  Certificate  examination  to      degree examination shall  be the  basis for awarding the  marks for academic qualification.  No weightage  has   been given  for higher examination  which the candidate   might have passed. However,  the  second  clause    indicates  that  the  marks obtained by  a candidate in the  academic qualification test shall be  added to the marks  obtained by him in the written examination as  well as  viva voce test and the aggregate so obtained shall   determine  his inter  se  position  in  the select list to  be prepared by the Selection Board. It would thus be   seen that the second part of the Rules gives power to   the Selection  Board to  award appropriate marks to the academic qualification  without giving  weightage for   post graduation or  Honours graduation  since marks   obtained by such candidates  for those qualification are  to be added to the marks  obtained by  him in  the written   examination as well as  viva voce  test and the aggregate  of all should be the basis to determine inter se  position in the select list to be prepared by the Selection Board. Thus, we  hold that  the process  for selection  of the candidates adopted by the Selection Board is consistent with clause (6)  of  Schedule  I  to  the  Rules.  The  Tribunal, therefore,  has   not   committed   any   error   warranting interference. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","S.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati. J. This appeal  is filed by the father of Rajeeva, who was married to  respondent No.1,  in the month May, 1987 and who committed suicide  within four  months. This appeal is filed against three  respondents who  were tried  for the offences punishable under  Sections 306,  Part B  and  498A  IPC  and acquitted  by   the  trial  court  and  whose  acquittal  is confirmed by the High court. The fact  that marriage of Rajeeva with respondent No.1 took place  on 18.5.87  is not in dispute. It is also not in dispute that she committed suicide on 4.9.87. It was  the prosecution  case that  she  had  committed suicide as a result of cruelty practiced by the respondents. It was alleged that respondent No.1 - the husband was having an affair  with another  woman and  for that  reason he also used to  beat her often. It was also alleged that respondent Nos. 2  and 3  were demanding  dowry from her and her father and as  the articles  demanded were not given they were ill- treating her.  In order  to prove  its case, the prosecution examined the Parents of Rajeeva, her sister and her friend. The trial  court after  appreciating that evidence came to the conclusion that their evidence was not consistent and it did  not inspire  any confidence as regards the demand of dowry and  ill-treatment. The trial court also held that the act of coming late at night by the husband did not amount to an act  of cruelty, It, therefore, accredited the accused of all the charges levelled against them. The  High   court  after  reappreciating  the  evidence confirmed those  findings. The  High Court has held that the whole story  regarding demand  of dowry  was  unnatural  and improbable in  view of  the fact that Rajeeva was married to respondent No.1  at the  instance of respondent Nos. 2 and 3 that before or at the time of marriage they had not demanded any dowry  and that  they also knew that financial condition of the  father of  Rajeeva was  not such  that he could have given a  scooter, a  fridge, and almirah, a water filter and cash of Rs.2000/-. On going  through the  judgments of both the courts and the evidence,  We find  that the  reasons given  by the  two http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 courts for  not placing  reliance  upon  the  aforesaid  two witnesses are not at all improper, PW l - father of Rajeeva, happened to  be a  friend of  respondent Nos.  2 and  3. His daughter was  married to respondent No. 1 at the instance of respondent Nos.2  and 3. It was also not disputed that while fixing the  marriage, no  demand for dowry was made. In view of these  facts and circumstances, it is not believable that within seven  days of  the marriage, they would have started demanding such articles. Even in the letter, Ex.P.4 produced by the  friend of  Rajeeva -  PW 5,  there is  no mention of demand of dowry or ill-treatment, by any of respondents. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. The bail bonds are ordered to be concealed.","The father of Rajeeva, who was married to  respondent No.1,  in the month May, 1987 and who committed suicide within four  months.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard  learned  counsel  on  both  sides.  The notification under  Section 4  [1] of  the Land  Acquisition Act, 1894  [for short, the ""Act""] was published in the State Gazette on  October 9,  1980 acquiring  large extent of land admeasuring  105   acres  for  defence  purposes.  The  Land Acquisition Officer [LAO] awarded compensation @ Rs.30/- per square yard  by his award dated July 16, 1982. On reference, the civil  Court enhanced  the compensation by its award and decree dated  March 31, 1986 to a sum of Rs.108/- per square yard. Being  dissatisfied with  the  award,  the  respondent filed the  appeal. The  claimants  also  filed  their  cross objections. the  High Court  in the  impugned  judgment  and order dated  March 31.  1992 made  in CCCA Nos.60-64 of 1986 reduced the compensation after the deductions to Rs.65/- per square yard in respect of 1 and abutting road and Rs.60/-per square yard  in respect  of other  land. Thereby, it allowed the appeal  of  the  respondent  and  dismissed  the  cross- objections against the order of the High Court  reducing the compensation, these  appeals by  special leave    have  been filed. Shri Mukul Mudgal, l earned counsel for the appellants, firstly contended that the High Court has committed an error in relying  upon another  judgment reducing the compensation to Rs.60/- per square yard wherein the High Court had relied upon  a  sale  deed  Ex.A3.  The  lands  of  the  appellants admeasure 17  acres and  17 gunthas, while the lands covered in that appeal were of the extent of 21 acres and 18 gunthas but all  the lands  are covered  by the common notification. Under these  circumstances, the  High Court  with a  view to maintain consistency  has rel  Red upon  a sale  deed  Ex.A3 produced therein  which was  accepted in CCCA No.11/1985 and finally reduced  the compensation to Rs.60;- per square yard We need  not go  into the  correctness of  the High  Court’s http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 relying  upon  a  single  sale  deed  Ex.A3  in  determining compensation at uniform rate since the State did not come in appeal, Suffice  it to state that Rs.60/- per square yard is just and adequate. It is  further contended  by Shri  Mudgal that value of the land  does not  get pegged  down on  account of the land being in  occupation of  a tenant  and the  circumstances in this behalf  taken  into  account  by  the  High  Court,  is irrelevant. We  find no  force in the contention. A freehold land and  one burdened  with  encumbrances  do  make  a  big difference in  attracting willing  buyers. A  freehold  land normally  commands   higher  compensation   while  the  land burdened with encumbrances secures lesser price. The fact of a tenant  in occupation  would  be  an  encumbrance  and  no willing purchaser  would willingly  offer the  same price as would  be   offered  for   a  freehold   land.  Under  those circumstances,  the   High  Court  would  be  right  in  its conclusion that  the land  burdened with  encumbrances takes lesser price  than the freehold land. The encumbrances would operate as  a disabling factor to peg down the price when we compare the same with freehold land. Considered in  these perspectives,  we  hold  that  the reduction of  the compensation  from Rs.108/-  to Rs.60  and Rs.65/- per square yard is not unjustified. Appeals are accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The notification under  Section 4  [1] of  the Land  Acquisition Act, 1894  [for short, the ""Act""] was published in the State Gazette on October 9, 1980 acquiring  large extent of land admeasuring 105   acres for defence purposes.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The  only   question  is:   whether  the   disciplinary authority could  withhold payment  of arrears  of salary for the period  of suspension from September 5, 1986 to April 2, 1987, namely,  the date  of  suspension  till  the  date  of passing of the final orders? The respondent  was  a  conductor.  A  chargesheet  was issued imputing  misconduct in  not issuing the tickets. The Enquiry Officer, though had not recorded finding of proof of misconduct, the  disciplinary authority  did not  agree with the Enquiry  Officer’s  report  and  has  given  reasons  in support of  the disagreement,  recorded a  finding as to how the charges  have been  proved by  giving opportunity to the respondent  to  show  why  the  punishment  of  stoppage  of increments and  also with-holding  payments  of  arrears  of salary as  punishment.  The  respondent  had  submitted  his explanation.  On  consideration  thereof,  the  disciplinary authority imposed  stoppage of  three annual increments with cumulative effect  and also  with-held payment of arrears of salary for  the suspension period. The trial Court dismissed the suit.  On appeal,  it was  reversed  and  the  suit  was decreed. In S.A. No.208/93 dated November 25, 1993, the High Court of Punjab & Haryana confirmed the appellate decree. The appellate  decree  envisages  confirmation  of  the stoppage of  three increments  with  cumulative  effect  but interfered with the order of with-holding payment of arrears of salary  as a  measure of  punishment. The appellate Court held that  the disciplinary authority had no power to impose the said punishment. We have  heard counsel on both sides. It is an admitted position that the charges have been proved. Once the charges have been  proved, it  is settled  law that the disciplinary authority is empowered to impose appropriate punishment. The rule indicates  with-holding of payment of arrears of salary as  one   of  the   modes   of   punishment.   Under   these http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 circumstances,  the   disciplinary  authority   had  rightly exercised its  power. The civil Court had no jurisdiction to substitute  the   punishment  imposed  by  the  disciplinary authority. The civil Court is not a court of appeal in civil suits.

" Present: Hon’ble the Chief Justice Hon’ble Mrs. justice Sujata V. Manohar Hon’ble Mr. Justice B. N. Kirpal Pradeep jain and Ms. Manjula Gupta, Adv, for the Petitioner. N. K. Bajpai and W.A. Qadri, Adv. for the Respondents O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: This Petition  for special  leave was  dismissed by  an order dated  16.12.96 passed  by a  bench of  Two  Judges  - Verma, J. (as he then was) and Kirpal, j.  In view, however, of a  judgement of another Bench of two Judges (K. Ramaswamy and G.B.  Pattanaik, JJ.),  in  a  similar  matter  Mediwell Hospital &  Ors,(1997<1) SCC  759) the order of 16.12.96 was recalled by  the order of 8.8.97.  The reasons for recall as set out in the order of 8.8.97 are:- ""After   we    had   dismissed S.L.P.(c)  No.  23964  of  1996  on 16.12.96,  another   2-Judge  Bench appears to have granted relief in a similar  matter   which  may   give impression  that   the  view  taken therein   different.       It   is, therefore,  appropriate   that  the possible ambiguity  or  uncertainty on the  question of  law should  be removed by  judgement of  a 3-judge bench.   We, therefore , recall our order dated  16.12.1996  dismissing the  special   leave  petition  and direct  that   the  special   leave petition  be   listed  for  hearing before a 3-Judge Bench.  The papers be placed before the Hon’ble C.J.I. for constituting the Bench. Accordingly, we have heard the parties.  In the case of Mediwell Hospital & Health Care Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors.  (supra), this  court on the merits of the view taken by the  Bench in  this  case  while  passing  the  order  of dismissal.   In para  10 of that judgement it is recorded as http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 follows: ""Thus a  diagnostic centre run by a private   individual    purely   on commercial   basis   may   not   be entitled to the exemption under the notification issued  by the Central Government.   The conclusion of the Central Government  as well as that of the  High Court  on this  score, therefore, may  not be  held to  be incorrect."" The court,  however, granted relief to the appellant in that case  on  the  ground  that  several  other  individual diagnostic centres  not attached  to any  hospital had  been granted the exemption under the notification in question and hence there  should not  be any  discrimination against  the appellant under Article 14.  The relief was granted entirely on the basis of Article 14. We fail to see how Article 14 can be attracted in cases where wrong  orders are  issued in  favour of others.  Wrong orders cannot  be perpetuated with the help of Article 14 on the such  wrong orders were earlier passed in favour of some other persons  and, therefore,  there will be discrimination against  them.     In   fact,  in   the  case  of  Union  of India[Railway   Board] &  Ors.   Vs. J. V. Subhaiah and Ors. (1996 (2)  SCC 258), the same Learned judge in his judgement has observed  in para  21 that  the  principle  of  equality enshrined under  Article 14  does not  apply when  the order relied upon is unsustainable in law and is illegal.  Such an order cannot form the basis for holding that other employees are discriminated against under Article 14.  The benefits of the exemption  notification, in  the present  case,  cannot, therefore, be  extended to the petitioner on the ground that such benefit  has been  wrongly extended  to others.    With respect,  the   decision   in Mediwell hospital (supra) does not lay down the correct  law on this point. In  the   premises,  the   special  leave  petition  is dismissed.","This Petition for special leave was dismissed by an order dated 16.12.96 passed by a bench of two Judges - Verma, J.

" D E R      The  main contention raised by learned counsel for the appellant  is  that  the National Commission ought  to  have allowed the claim on the basis of the report of the Surveyor who  had  recommended payment of Rs.41,13,127.87/-  for  the value of the gunny bags destroyed in the fire.  The National Commission before which this question was raised, considered the  evidence  on record and ultimately recorded  a  finding that the appellant itself by its letter dated 19.12.1989 had invited  quotation  from various insurance companies  for  a Fire  Policy  setting out the details as under :  ""1.   Fire Policy  Stock  of Sugar 400 Lakhs Stock of gunnies 12  Lakhs Stock  of  sulphur & 6 Lakhs chemicals Stock of  stores  and spares  35 Lakhs ----------- Total value of Fire Policy  453 Lakhs  ----------- The entire stock lying in the premises of the  appellant was destroyed by a major fire accident  which took  place  on 15.11.1990 and although the Policy  had  not till  then been issued by the respondents, the claim  raised by  the appellant was not repudiated and the Policy was also issued in December, 1990.  The appellant and the respondents mutually  settled  the  claim  so far as  other  items  were concerned  but  they  did  not   agree  on  the  quantum  of compensation  for the stock of gunny bags and  consequently, the  appellant approached the National Commission which held that  though  there  was  no   deficiency  of  service,  the respondents  were  liable  to   pay  Rs.11,69,994/-  to  the appellant  as  they themselves had made that offer by  their letter  dated  24.4.1992.   The   National  Commission  also allowed interest at the rate of 18 per cent from the date of its  order  provided  the  amount was not  paid  within  two months.   Having  regard to the facts and  circumstances  of this  case, we are not prepared to accept the contention  of the  appellant’s  counsel  that the claim should  have  been allowed  in  terms  of  the surveyor’s report.   It  is  not disputed  that  the  appellant itself by  its  letter  dated 19.12.1989  had invited quotations for a Fire Policy and  in that letter of invitation, it had mentioned the value of the Policy  in  which they had indicated the value of the  gunny bags  as  Rs.12  lakhs.  In this  background,  the  National Commission  was justified in not placing any reliance on the surveyor’s  report.   We  fully  endorse  the  view  of  the National  Commission and reject the contention raised by the appellant’s  counsel  that  the  claim ought  to  have  been allowed  in  terms of the surveyor’s report.   We,  however, feel  that the interest ought to have been awarded from  the date  on  which  the  claim was filed  before  the  National Commission.   Consequently,  while maintaining the order  of the National Commission for payment of Rs.11,69,994/- to the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellant  as  value of Gunny Bags, direct that this  amount shall  be  paid within two months from today and  that  too, with  interest at the rate of 18 per cent per annum from the date  of filing of the claim before the National  Commission till  the date of actual payment.

Although  the conduct  of   the  O.Ps.  does  not appear to  be very  fair but in the facts  and   circumstances  of  the case, I  do not  think if  fit  and proper to  pass any further orders.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 5182 of 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Appellant challenged the order passed by a learned Single Judge dismissing the revision petition filed by the appellant. Detailed reference to the factual aspect is unnecessary in view of the limited nature of the controversy. Marriage between the appellant and respondent No. 2 was solemnized in June 1980.  Differences cropped up between the parties and various cases were instituted. Grievance was made  by the respondent No. 2 that appellant had married for a second time though his marriage with respondent No.2 was subsisting and thereby he committed offence punishable under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’).  Learned First Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raebareli held that the appellant was guilty. An appeal was preferred before the District and Sessions Judge Raebareli.  By order dated 29.9.1999 the appeal was dismissed and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.  A Revision Petition under Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Code’) was filed before the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench.  By the impugned judgment learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the Criminal Revision holding that concurrent findings had been recorded by the courts below and therefore no interference was called for.  The application was disposed of in the absence of appellant’s counsel.  An application to recall the order was filed on the ground that the matter could not have been decided ex parte.  The  review application was also dismissed on the ground that there was belated approach for recalling the order. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that on 30.1.2004 because of circumstances beyond control there was no appearance when the matter was taken up.  The appellant has been pursuing the remedy diligently for nearly five years and without taking http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 note of the various difficulties due to which the appellant’s counsel could not appear, the Revision Petition should not have been dismissed. On 29.9.2006 notice was issued, limited to the question as to why the High Court should not re-hear the matter since the High Court dismissed the Revision Petition without hearing the appellant.  There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent. There is no dispute that prior to the date of disposal i.e. 30.1.2004 the appellant was diligently pursuing the remedy. The appellant had also pointed out circumstances due to which the appellant’s counsel could not appear on the date fixed. The plea has not been disbelieved. Considering the background facts as highlighted above it is clear that the appellant has always been diligently pursuing the case. It is not the case of the respondent No.2 that the appellant was in any manner responsible for delay in the proceedings. Above being the position, we set aside the orders of the High Court dated 30.1.2004, 17.4.2006.  The High Court shall hear the matter on merits.

" O R D ER Leave granted. We have  heard learned  counsel  on  both  sides.  This appeal by  special leave  arises from the judgment and order of the  Division Bench  of the High Court of Allahabad, made on March  22, 1996  in the  First Appeal  No.  129/95.  This appeal and  also the  First Appeal No.128/95 before the High Court are  commonly disposed  of since  the acquisition  was common.

" J   U  D  G  M  E  N  T RAJENDRA BABU  :  J.  : Leave granted. On being convicted under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code (for short ’IPC’) and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years, the appellant preferred an appeal.  The High Court  held that the conviction of the appellant should be under Section 326 IPC and not 307 IPC and the sentence was modified to 3 years rigorous imprisonment.  In reaching this conclusion, the High Court, after analysing the evidence, held as under :- ""that appellant Sattan Sahani along with other co-accused formed an unlawful assembly, entered into the house of the informant and assaulted the injured witnesses including P.W. 1, Malhu Shahani.  Though Malhu was given ’Bhala’ blow in his abdomen by appellant No. 3, Sattan Sahani causing penetrating wound, but it appears that he had no intention to kill him because he had given only one blow.   As such, offence attracts conviction under Section 326 of the Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon to P.W. 1, Malhu Shahani."" The medical evidence in the case is as per the version put forth by Dr. Jaldhar Prasad Jha, P. W. 10.  He stated that on 1.3.1983 at 4 a.m. he examined Malhu Shahni and found one penetrating wound ""  x  1/10"" (depth not probed) on the upper part of the abdomen on midline.  He also found one incised wound ""   x 2/10"" into skin deep on the outer side of left eye of Malhu.  He also found swelling 4""  x  3"" on left thigh and a swelling 2""  x  1"" on left upper arm of Malhu. He opined that the penetrating wound was caused by sharp pointed weapon and incised wound was caused by sharp cutting weapon and the swelling was caused by hard and blunt substance and the age of the injuries was within 12 hours. It is now contended before us that the appellant had inflicted only one blow in the spur of the moment to Malhu Shahani in the middle of the abdomen; that the injury caused was only ""  x  1/10""  (depth not probed) on the middle of the abdomen and thus did not affect any vital organ of the injured person nor did it impair the functioning of the injured person in any manner. For conviction under Section 326 the requirements of Section 320 IPC must be satisfied.   Considering the fact that though only one blow was caused by the appellant, from the weapon used namely ’Bhala’, it must be inferred that it was likely to cause the death of the injured person and, therefore, the offence is made out under Section 326 IPC and he was rightly convicted under that provision. However, in regard to sentence, we are inclined to take a lenient view in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the matter.  It is brought to our notice that there was compromise between the parties and on the basis of compromise petition the trial court directed the other accused who were found guilty of the charges under Sections 147 and 148 to be released on executing a bond to keep peace and be of good behaviour for a period of one year by invoking Section 360 Cr.P.C.   The appellant has already undergone about six months of imprisonment so far.   The incident took place about two decades back.  In these circumstances, we impose the sentence of imprisonment for the period already undergone and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/-. In default of payment of fine,  the appellant shall undergo imprisonment for a further period of three months.  On payment of fine,  he shall be released forthwith. The appeal is allowed in part to the extent indicated above.",Sattan Sahani was convicted under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code (for short ’IPC’) and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years.

" JUDGMENT 1994(1) SCR 186 The following Order of the Court was delivered: 1.  The appellant was declared to have 15 standard acres as surplus land by an order of the Collector dated December 12, 1960 made under the provisions of the East Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953, which had come into force on April 15, 1953. That order became final. Earlier, in the year 1956 under the East Punjab Area Utilisation of Lands Act, 1949, the possession of 41 kanals 19 marlas which is now declared as surplus, was taken by the Collector and leased out to a tenant. It appears that during consolidation proceedings, the appellant had manoeuvred to obtain a decision from the authorities that he had only 6 standard acres of surplus land. Subsequently, in the year 1979, the appellant sought for restoration of land leased as being surplus land. In pursuance thereof, the Authorities appear to have issued directions to restore the leased land to the appellant. However, a simultaneous proceeding appears to have been taken to assign the earlier declared surplus land to landless poor. The appellant questioned the action of the respondent in assigning such surplus land to the landless poor on the ground that he was not given even show cause notice, by filing a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed by order dated 3.1.1994. The present appeal by special leave is directed against that order. 2.  Shri K.K. Mohan, learned counsel for the appellant strenuously contended that the appellant while is declared as surplus holder only of 5 standard acres of land, the respondents could not assign the lands in excess of 5 standard acres that too without issue of show cause notice to the appellant. We find no force in the contention. Admittedly, the appellant was declared as holder of 15 standard acres of surplus land by the order passed by the Collector on December 12, 1960. Having allowed that order to become final, the only course open to him was to have carried it in appeal or to have it reopened under that Act or under the Haryana Ceiling on Land Holding Act, 1972, provided the law permitted reopening of the proceedings and recomputation of the surplus holdings. That was not done. By operation of section 12(3) of the Haryana Act, the surplus land stood vested in the State free from all encumbrances on and with effect from December 23, 1972. Jaswant Kaur v. State of Haryana, A.I.R. (1977) P & H 221, a Full Bench Judgment which was approved by this Court in Jodha Ram v. F.C. Haryana, [1994] 1 S.C.C. 27, holds that the lands stood vested in the State absolutely effective from December 23, 1972. From that date then pre-existing right, title and interest in 15 standard acres including that in 5 standard acres of land stood vested in the State and the appellant stood divested of the title to the land. Therefore, the question of restoring 5 acres of land to the appellant or giving notice to the appellant does not arise. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 3. It may not be construed that the other excess land which stood vested in the Government by operation of section 12(3) read with the order dated December 12, 1960 would impede any right, if the appellant had got by any subsequent orders modifying the determination of the surplus area in accordance with the provisions of 1953 Act. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed but without costs.","The appellant was declared to have 15 standard acres as surplus land by an order of the Collector dated December 12, 1960.

Mahajan, R.S. Gupta, Advs. with him for the respondents. O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: (With C.A.Nos.5438/94, 7113/94, SLP (C) No.2235/94) O R D E R K. Venkataswami, J. Substitution allowed. Special leave granted in SLP (C) No.22356/95. In all  these appeals  a common question of law arises. As a  matter of fact the main judgment was given by the High Court of  Punjab and  Haryana  in  C.W.P.  No.12969/91.  The common issue  agitated before the High Court was whether the respondents were  entitled to  parity of  scales of pay with those of their counter- parts in Rural Community Theatres. In the  view we  propose to  take after hearing counsel for the parties, we do not think it appropriate or necessary to set  out in detail the facts and discuss on merits. Hence this detail  the facts  and discuss  on merits.  Hence  this brief Order. Before the High Court the respondents, members of Drama parties (Actors,  Stage Masters, Harmonium Masters and Tabla Masters) claimed  parity of scales of pay with those of such Artists employed  in Rural  Community Theatres on the ground that the  nature  of  work,  duties  and  qualifications  of members of  Drama parties  and members  of  Rural  Community Theatres are  similar. Though  it was contended on behalf of the mode of recruitments, duties, minimum qualifications are quite different  between the two parties, it does not appear that the  same was  substantiated by  producing the relevant materials. The  High Court  on the  basis of  the  arguments advanced and  the materials  placed before  it came  to  the conclusion that  the materials  placed before it came to the conclusion that  the respondents  are entitled to the parity of scales  of pay with those of their counter-parts in Rural http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Community Theatre. Aggrieved by that, the present appeals are filed. At the  time of  issuing notice  in SLP  arising out of Civil Appeal  No.3956/92 this  Court 20.8.92  inter alia has stated as follows: ""The  petitioner  is  permitted  to file an additional affidavit giving particulars  on   the  respondents’ claim for  parity within two weeks. Counter, if  any, be filed within a week thereafter."" Accordingly,  the   appellants  have  filed  additional affidavit on  2.9.92. From the paper book it does not appear that  the   respondents  have  filed  any  counter  to  this additional affidavit. After hearing  counsel on  both sides,  we feel that in the  light   of  the   additional  affidavit  filed  by  the appellants, the  issue requires further consideration by the High Court.  In the absence of any counter to the additional affidavit by  the respondents  herein, we  could not proceed further to decide the matter finally. Accordingly, we  set aside the orders of the High Court in all  the appeals  and remit  the matters back to the High Court for fresh herring and decision in accordance with law. Liberty is  given to  both parties  to file their additional affidavits/documents, if  any, before  the High  Court.  The appeals are accordingly disposed of.

But  we do not propose to admit http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the appeal  since after hearing a longish argument from Shri Anil B.  Divan on  behalf of the appellant, we are satisfied on the  material produced  before us  and on  perusal of the counter affidavit  of the  Government that,  there were good reasons for  passing the  impugned order.  We must, however, impress  upon   the  Government   that  while  disposing  of applications under  Sections 21, 22 and 23 of the Monopolies and Restrictive  Trade Practices Act, 1969 it must give good reasons in  support of  its order  and not  merely state its bald conclusion.  The faith  of the people in administrative tribunals can  be sustained only if the tribunals act fairly and dispose  of the  matters before  them by well considered orders. The  relevant material  must be made available to be objectors because with out it, they cannot possibly must the claim or contentions of the applicants under Sections 21, 22 and 23  of the  MRTP Act.  The refusal  of the Government to furnish such  material to  the objectors  can  amount  to  a denial of  a reasonable opportunity to the objectors to meet the applicant’s case. And denial of a reasonable opportunity to meet the other man’s case is denial of natural justice.

" O R D E R Mr.  Bijan  Kumar  Ghosh,  Advocate  takes  notice  for respondent No.1. It is  not in  dispute that  the respondent  came to be appointed against  a casual  vacancy in  the Central  Social Welfare Board  Scheme. The  respondent has  been  continuing ever since  the date  of appointment,  namely, February  11, 1992. She filed writ petition in the Calcutta High Court for direction to  regularise her  services. The  learned  Single Judge held  in the  judgment that  she was  not entitled  to regularisation as  the mode  of her  appointment was  not in accordance with  the rules.  In  the  impugned  order  dated January 24,  1996,  the  Division  Bench  in  FMAT  No.16/95 reversed the  order of the learned Single Judge and directed regularisation of the services of respondent as under: ""The appeal,  therefore,  succeeds.

The respondents   are    directed    to regularise  the   service  of   the appellant  in   the  post  of  Gram Sevika with  effect from  the  date she  completed   three   years   of service in  the  concerned  Project positively within  two months  from date and  also to  pay her  arrears salaries  and  other  benefits,  if any, within the aforesaid period."" Calling this  order in  question,  this  SLP  has  been filed. It  is not in dispute that the project is being wound up in  a phased manner and the services of the employees are being dispensed  according is  stated by the learned counsel for the  petitioners that  no junior  to the  respondent was allowed to  continue in  the said project. It is stated that there are  other projects  being operated similarly, but the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 persons engaged  therein also  are continuing  on  temporary basis and  are senior  to  the  respondent.  Therefore,  she cannot be  regularised in  any other  scheme. In view of the above stand,  we direct  the  petitioners  to  continue  the respondent in any other temporary scheme but keeping in mind the overall  seniority of  all the  persons; the  dispensing with the  services should  be on  last-come-first-go  basis, i.e., the  juniormost incumbent  has to go out first. As and when vacancies would arise, such persons whose services have been dispensed with will be taken back without following the practice of  requisitioning the names of candidates from the employment exchange.  They would  be regularised  only  when regular posts are available and in accordance with the order of seniority.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the High Court of Calcutta passed on September 6, 1995 in FMAT No. 2098/94. The undisputed facts are that respondent Nos. 1-91 wear engaged as  contract labour  by  Bhagwat  Prasad  Choudhury, Respondent No.  94 and  while they  were working,  they were refused payment  of the  full wages.  As a consequence, they laid claim  for  payment  of  the  amount.  Ultimately,  the Division Bench  has directed  by the  impugned judgment that the appellant  shall be  liable to  pay the  arrears of  the balance of the amount of the wages. Shri  V.P.  Rao,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the appellant contends  that the  arrears of wages are not wages under Section  21 of  the Contract  Labour  (Regulation  and Abolition) Act,  1973 and  that, therefore, the appellant is not liable  to make  the payment to the respondents. We find no force in the contention. Section 21 postulates the responsibility for payment of wages.  Under   sub-section  (1)   a  contractor   shall  be responsible for  payment of wages to each worker employed by him as  contract labour  and such wages shall be paid before the expiry  of such  period as may be prescribed. Under sub- section (4), in case the contractor fails to make payment of wages within  the prescribed  period or makes short payment, then the  principal employer shall be liable to make payment of wages  in full or the unpaid balance due, as the case may be, to  the contract  labour employed  by the contractor and recover the  amount so  paid fro  the contractor  either  by deducting from  any amount  payable to  the contractor under any contract  or as  a debt  payable by the contractor. That liability has  been prescribed under sub-section (2) thereof which says  that every  principal employer  shall nominate a representative duly  authorised by  him to be present at the time of disbursement of wages by the contractor and it shall be the  duty of  such representative  to certify the amounts paid as wages in such manner as may be prescribed. Thus it  could be  seen that  the principal employer is statutorily responsible  to ensure  payment of  the wages as http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 per the  law. In  case the contractor commits default in the wages, the  principal employer  is made  responsible for due payment and  in case such payment is made, he is entitled to have it  recovered by  deducting from  any amount payable to the contractor  under the  contract or  as a debt payable by the contractor. Thus, it  is  clear  that  the  principal  employer  is required to  pay the  wages. The  term ‘wages’  includes the balance  of   wages  or   arrears   thereof.   Under   these circumstances, we  do not think that it is a case warranting interference. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta passed on September 6, 1995 in FMAT No. 2098/94.

The Lucknow  bench of  the High  Court by  order  dated November  17,   1983  dismissed   all  the   writ  petitions Subsequently, pending appeals, the Government had decided by proceedings dated  December 1, 1984 to sanction the creation of 1300  supernumerary post of civil police in the pay scale of Rs.  515-860/- and  that  ""only  those  officiating  Sub- Inspector  will   be  absorbed   on  these  posts  who  have officiated on  the posts of Sub-Inspector for three years or more till  30th September,  1984"".

In  respect of  other  Sub-Inspector covered under  the said para 191 who had not completed three years of service, the reversion stood upheld. The  appellant  herein  claims  that  he  was  promoted temporarily in  February 1976  as a  Sub-Inspector  and  was appointed on that premise and that he had been continuing in that post till he was reverted on May, 1983. It would appear that  pending  appeal,  the  appeal,  obviously,  must  have retired from  service. However, if the case of the appellant had been  considered in the light of the direction issued by this Court, no further action would have been needed. If the Government did  not consider  his case  since the appeal was pending, it  is now  for the Government to consider his case in  accordance   with  rules  for  temporary  promotion  and confirmation in  on of  the 1300 supernumerary posts created by the  Government by  the aforesaid  order dated 19th April 1985 passed  by this  Court, and to pass appropriate in that behalf.

Sampath,  learned  counsel appearing for  the appellant,  and  have  gone  through  the judgment and records placed before the Court. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Madras High  Court, made on April 12, 1996 in Second Appeal No.  372/83. The  appellant  had  filed  a  suit  for ejectment of  Nos.1 to  3 from  the suit  property  and  for recovery of  possession thereof  on the  pleading  that  the house bearing  Door No.12-A and 12-B (Old No.12-A) in Mosque Street, Royapuram,  Madras-13 was  his property;  the super- structure thereof  was purchased  by the  appellant by  sale deed dated  September 13, 1975 from Mohd. Hussain under whom the third respondent came into possession as his sub-lessee. Therefore, the  possession may  be directed  to be  given to him. Though the trial court and the appellate Court had held that the  appellant is the owner of the property and the 3rd respondent is  a sub-lessee  of respondent Nos. 1 and 2, the High Court  has gone into the documentary evidence. It would appear that  this  property  is  situated  in  a  triangular passage leading  to Mosque  Street, Adem  Saheb  Street  and Thoppa Modali  Street in Madras City. It is also an admitted position that the 3rd defendant-3rd respondent had purchased the same  land under a registered sale deed in the year 1969 much earlier  to  the  appellant’s  purchasing  the  alleged super-structure on  the said  property. The  High Court also found that  the  3rd  defendant  had  purchased  the  super- structure. It  is sought  to be  contended by  the appellant that the  lands, the  subject matter  of the purchase of the super-structure by  the appellant  and the  respondents, are different and  distinct and, therefore, the finding recorded by the High Court is not correct in law. We need not go into the  question  in  this  behalf  for  the  reason  that  the appellant  has   proceeded  on  the  premise  that  the  3rd respondent is  a sub-lessee  of respondent-defendant  Nos. 1 and 2  alleged to  have been let in by Mohd. Hussain. who is said to  be the  owner of  the super-structure  from who the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellant had claimed title. In effect the decree sought for is against  the real  owner of  the land,  namely, the third defendant. Under  these circumstances, the suit as framed by the appellant  was not correctly decreeable. The High Court, therefore, was  right on  this ground in rejecting the claim of the appellant and dismissing the suit. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" O R D E R Tulsi Singh,  the appellant  before us,  was  arraigned before the  Special Court  Ferozepur for  the murder  of his wife  Chhinder   Kaur.  The  trial  ended  in  an  order  of conviction and sentence recorded against the appellant under Section 302  I.P.C. and  aggrieved thereby  he has filed the instant appeal. In absence  of any  eye  witness  to  the  murder,  the prosecution rested  its case upon the confession made by the appellant before  a Judicial  Magistrate and the evidence of the  doctor   who  held  post-mortem  examination  upon  the deceased and opined that her death was homicidal. From the  impugned judgment  we find that the appellant did not dispute the fact that his wife met with an homicidal death. He,  however, contended  that he  was not responsible for the  murder, nor did he make any voluntary confession in respect thereof  as alleged  by the prosecution. The Special Court, however,  found the  confession made by the appellant to be  voluntary  and  true  and  relying  solely  thereupon convicted the appellant. The only  point that  has been  urged on  behalf of the appellant in  support of  this appeal  is that  the  Special Court was  not justified  in entertaining  the confession as evidence -  much less  relying upon the same - as it was not recorded in  accordance with  the provisions  of Section 164 Cr.P.C. In elaborating this contention it has been submitted that before  recording the confession Shri O.P. Garg (PW 1), the learned  Magistrate, did  not explain  to the  appellant that he  was not  bound to  made a confession and that if he did so  it might  be used  against him  not did  he put  any question to  him to  satisfy himself that the confession was being voluntarily made, as required under sub-section (2) of Section 164 Cr.P.C. To ascertain  whether the  above contention is borne by the record or not we have carefully looked into the evidence of the  Magistrate as  also the  confession (Ext.  P/6).  On perusal thereof, we find that after his arrest the appellant was produced before the Magistrate on June 16, 1984 and sent to  police   Custody  for  a  week  on  the  prayer  of  the Investigation Officer. He was thereafter produced before the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Magistrate on  June 22,  1984 when  he volunteered to make a confession. The  Magistrate remanded him to judicial custody with a  direction that he be produced on the following date, that is, on June 23, 1984. It appears that immediately after he was  produced on that day the learned Magistrate recorded his confession. Though the learned Magistrate testified that before recording  the confession  he satisfied  himself that the accused  (appellant) was making a voluntary statment and that after giving due caution he recorded it, the confession does not  anywhere indicate  as to  whether before recording the same  he gave him the requisite caution and put question to satisfy himself that it was being made voluntarily. These are the  basic pre-requisites  for  recording  a  confession under sub-section  (2) of  Section 164  Cr.P.C. and  a  mere endorsement  in   accordance  with   sub-section  (4)  after recording it would not fulfil the requirements of the former sub-section. Since  none of  the two requirements of Section 164 (2)  Cr.P.C. has  been complied with we are left with no other alternative  to hold that the Special Court was not at all justified  in entertaining the confession as a voluntary one. Once  the confession is left out of consideration as it has got  to be  - impugned conviction cannot be sustained in absence of  any other  incriminating  evidence  against  the appellant. In the  result we  allow this  appeal,  set  aside  the conviction and  sentence recorded against the appellant. The appellant, who  is on  bail, is  discharged  from  his  bail bonds.","Tulsi Singh was convicted of the murder of his wife Chhinder   Kaur.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2155 OF 2002 Assessee-appellant (hereinafter referred to as ’the ’assessee’) claimed the C.I.Chil led Rolls being manufactured by the appellant under chapter heading 84.37 which in turn is exempted from the payment of excise duty vide exemption Notification No.56/95-CE dated 16.3.1995. A show cause notice dated 27th September, 1996 was issued to the assessee alleging t hat the assessee first manufactures C.I.castings which are later on captively consumed for producing the C.I.Chilled Rolls; that since the assessee was producing intermediary product, it was li able to pay the excise duty on the C.I.castings under chapter heading 7207.10. Assessee in reply to the show cause notice had taken the point that C.I.castings whi ch are intermediary product were not marketable and, therefore, excise duty could not be levied. According to the assessee, C.I.castings are in the process of manufacturing C.I.Chilled Roll s. CIVIL APPEAL NO.2155 OF 2002 -2- The adjudicating authority in its order dated 29.1.1999 recorded a finding to the fo llowing effect: ""Both the circulars issued by Board as mentioned above do not speak anything about marketability of castings and as such marketability of castings have got no bearing on the classification of the product.  Even otherwise the castings manufactured by the market are capable of being sold in the market."" Assessee, being aggrieved, filed appeal before the appellate authority.  Appellate a uthority in its order dated 20th February, 2001 reiterated the finding recorded by the adjudicating authority and held that: ""I also observe that the appellants in para 3.1 of their grounds of appeal have stated that these castings were sold to the customers who placed orders for the same and not in the open market. Even where the goods are manufactured as per the specifications and the requirements of a customer, the same satisfy the criteria of the marketability."" The Tribunal has not recorded any finding regarding marketability of the intermediar y product i.e. C.I.castings.  Counsel appearing for the assessee very fairly concedes that if the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 intermediary product is marketable, then the excise duty would be payable because the final product i.e. C.I.Chilled Rolls is CIVIL APPEAL NO.2155 OF 2002 -3- exempted from payment of excise duty. Since, there is no finding recorded by the Tribunal regarding marketability, excise duty could not be levied on the intermediary product i.e. C.I.castings.  Counsel for the assessee relied upon a number of judgments to contend that unless the intermediary product is marketable, excise duty could not be levied. (cases refer red: Union Carbide India Ltd. vs. Union of India & Others reported in (1986) 2 SCC 547; Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizer Co. Ltd. vs. Collector of Excise & Customs reported in (2005) 7 SC C 94). In the absence of any finding recorded by the Tribunal regarding marketability, we a re handicapped and cannot proceed with the case any further.  Accordingly, we accept this appeal; set aside the impugned order of the Tribunal and remit the case to the Tribunal for passing a fresh order in accordance with law including the point regarding marketability of the intermediary product i.e. C.I.castings.  All contentions are left open.",Appellant claimed the C.I.Chil led Rolls being manufactured by the appellant under chapter heading 84.37 which in turn is exempted from the payment of excise duty vide exemption Notification No.56/95-CE dated 16.3.1995.,appointment,40.57

Out of the UDCs carrying the scale of Rs.330-560/-, 10%  of the  posts were earmarked with special grant of  pay of Rs.35/- in the secretariat and other places and they  were directed  to handle  cases of  complex nature involving deep  study and-competence.  For dealing with such cases certain  officers have been promoted to that 10% posts specified among  the UDCs in the secretariat as well as non- secretariat administrative  officers. They were being paid @ Rs.35/- per  month as  compensation for discharge of special duties. The  respondents were not actually discharging those duties but  being UDCs  they claimed  special pay of Rs.35/- .The Tribunal  in the  impugned order  fol1owing its earlier decision dated  9.10.1991 made  in  O.A.394/90  allowed  the petition and  directed payment. We have directed the counsel to find  out whether  any appeal  has been filed against the said order.  It would  appear that  no appeal has been filed against the  said order. However, it being a question of law and since  the matter  is of perennial problem applicable to several places,  we are  of the  considered  view  that  the failure to  file an  appeal in  one case  does not  have the effect of  following in  all other  cases. It  is seen  that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 payment of  Rs.35/- per  month to  UDCs discharging  special duties of  onerous nature,  is personal  pay so long as they discharge the same. Therefore, other UDCs who do not perform the special  duties, though  seniors, do  not ipso facto get the same  pay on  the parity  of equal  pay due  to  juniors getting higher  pay. Under these circumstances we are of the view that  the Tribunal  was wholly  incorrect in  directing payment to all the persons who did not discharge such duties assigned to  the 10%  special posts of UDCs carrying special pay of Rs.35/- per month.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 No. 114 of 1979 From the Judgment and order dated the 28th March 1978 of the Delhi High Court in Criminal Misc. No. 399/78. Randhir Jain Appellant. The order of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J. As long back as on August 1,1975 a Food  Inspector purchased a sample of suji (Semolina) from the respondent accused, which was found to contain excessive moisture and ash. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi acquitted the accused by his judgment dated July 19, 1977 on the ground that the Food Inspector did not send the required quantity of  the adulterated  article to  the Public Analyst for analysis. The Rules required the i the Food Inspector to send 250 gms. Of suji for analysis, whereas he sent only 200 gms.  The   High  Court  of  Delhi  dismissed  the  revision application filed  by the  Municipal  Corporation  of  Delhi summarily. The  learned Metropolitan Magistrate is clearly wrong in  the view  taken by  him, from which it must follow that the  High Court  was not  justified in  dismissing  the revision application  summarily.  The  fact  that  a  lesser quantity than  that prescribed  by the  Rules  is  sent  for analysis cannot  constitute an  impediment in the conviction of a  person accused of selling adulterated food, so long as the quantity  sent for  analysis is sufficient to enable the Analyst  to   make  a  satisfactory  analysis  according  to accepted tests.  We do  not, how  ever, propose to interfere with the order of acquittal since, this appeal was filed not so much  for the  purpose of  securing the conviction of the accused but  for the  purpose of  obtaining a  decision from this Court  on the  question whether  a conviction  could be recorded under  section  7  read  with  section  16  of  the Prevention of  Food Adulteration  Act even  if,  a  quantity smaller than  that required   by  the Rules  to be  sent for analysis is  sent for  the purpose of analysis to the Public Analyst. That question was decided long 286 back in  State of Kerala v. Alaserry Mohammed.(l) Therefore, though the  view taken by the courts below is unsupportable, we do  not propose  to interfere  with  the  ultimate  order passed by them.

Diwan for Respondent No. 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J. This is an appeal against an order passed by the  Delhi  High  Court  refusing  to  initiate  contempt proceedings against  the  respondents.  It  appears  that  a contempt matter  was pending  before a  Single Judge,  Delhi High Court  which was  heard at  length and the judgment was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reserved  on  the  9th  December,  1977.  The  judgment  was actually delivered  on 28-4-1978  and in  between these  two dates  certain   written  submissions   were  made   by  the respondents to  the Court  which the  appellant describes in his petition as private communications 937 to the Company Judge. The respondent P.N. Kaushik in para 36 of the counter-affidavit has made a specific allegation that at the  time of reserving the judgment the Company Judge had directed the  parties to  submit their  written  submissions regarding  the  points  at  issue  before  the  judgment  is delivered.

As these submissions were  made in  pursuance of  the  order  of  the Court, they  cannot be  held to be private communications to the Company  Judge in  order to  decide the  case.

These submissions form part of  the record  and, therefore, there is no question of their  being  regarded  as  private  communications  from  a litigant to  a Judge.  On the contrary, the Director-General of Resettlement  was appointed  as the  administrator by the Court itself  and being  an officer  of the court, he was at liberty to  make submissions  to the court in respect of the case  in  question.  The  High  Court  therefore  was  fully justified in  declining to  issue any  notice  for  contempt against the  respondents on  the submissions  filed  by  the appellant.

" O R D E R Though the  respondents have  been served,  no  one  is appearing either in person or through counsel. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant. The controversy  raised in  this case is covered by the judgment of  this Court  in N.  Narasimhaiah  vs.  State  of Karnataka [(1996)  3 SCC  88]. The  admitted facts  are that notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was  published on  August 26,  1982 and  enquiry  under Section 5-A was conducted thereafter. But before the receipt of  the  report  from  the  Land  Acquisition  Officer,  the declaration under  Section 6  was published on June 24, 1985 within  three  years.  Two  writ  petitions  were  filed  on December 10, 1985 challenging the notification under Section 4(1) and  the declaration  under Section  6. The  High Court allowed the  writ petitions  and  quashed  the  notification under Section  4(1) and  declaration under  Section 6 by the impugned judgment  dated February  26,  1991  made  in  Writ petition Nos.  19348 and  19349 of 1985. Thus, these appeals by special leave. It is  seen that  the declaration  under Section  6 was published  within   three  years   from  the   date  of  the notification under Section 4(1) as upheld by the High Court. But the  High Court noted that the enquiry under Section 5-A was not  properly conducted. The declaration under Section 6 dated June  24, 1985  quashed since  the notification  under Section 4(1)  was dated  August 26, 1982 and the declaration could  not  be  published  within  three  years  even  after excluding the period of pendency of the writ petitions under proviso to  Section 6  of the  Act. Thus,  the  notification under Section 4(1) was quashed. We find no justification for the  view   taken  by  the  High  Court.  It  is  seen  that declaration under  Section 6  was published,  as held by the High Court,  within three  years, but  the  conduct  of  the enquiry under  Section 5-A  was  found  fault  with  and  it requires to  be quashed.  If it  is quashed,  necessarily an http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 enquiry  under   Section  5-A   has  to  be  conducted.  The limitation,  therefore,   of  conducting   the  enquiry  and publication of  the declaration  within  three  years  would start running  from the  date of the receipt of the order of the High  Court and  not from the date on which the original publication of  the declaration  within  three  years  would start running  from the  date of the receipt of the order of the High  Court and  not from the date on which the original publication under  Section 4(1)  came to  be made. This view was laid by this Court in Narasimiah’s case (supra). For the same  ratio,   the  appeals   are  to  be  allowed  and  the declaration has  to be quashed. Accordingly, the declaration is quashed. The appellant is permitted to conduct an enquiry within a  period of four months from the date of the receipt of this  order and have the declaration published within one month thereafter. The appeals are accordingly allowed. No costs.","The controversy  raised in  this case is covered by the judgment of  this Court  in N. Narasimhaiah vs. State of Karnataka [(1996)  3 SCC  88].

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1150 of 1978. From  the  Judgment  and Order dated  22.9.1976  of  the Bombay High Court in Special Civil Appln. No. 1544 of 1971. B. Datta, J.P. Pathak and P.H.Parekh for the Appellant. A.M. Khanwilkar for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA,  J. The facts found in this appeal show that  the appellant, Laxmi Bai, was at the relevant time a member of a joint  family  with her son, the partition  pleaded  by  the appellant not having been accepted as genuine by the author- ities concerned. She terminated the tenancy of the predeces- sor  in title of the respondents by a notice dated June  24, 1960.  Under  the  provisions of Section 32  of  the  Bombay Tenancy  and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948  (hereinafter  re- ferred to as ""the said Act""), April 1, 1957, was declared as the  tillers’  day and Section 32 of the said  Act  provided biter alia that the tenants of the land who fell within  any of  categories  described  in sub-section (1)  of  the  said section were deemed to have purchased the land held by  them as  tenants from their landlords, free of  all  encumbrances subsisting  thereon on the said day. The case of the  appel- lant  is  that, in the present case, the  tillers’  day  was postponed  in view of the provisions of clause (a)  of  sub- section  (1) of Section 32 F of the said Act, as she  was  a widow and hence, it must be held that she had terminated the tenancy  of tenant, Dayanu, the predecessor in title of  the respondents before he became a deemed purchaser of the land. It is not possible to accept this contention in view of  the proviso  to sub-section (1) of Section 32 F of the said  Act which  provides, inter alia that the tillers’ day would  not get  postponed where the widow-land owner is a member  of  a joint  family,  one of the members whereof was  outside  the protected  categories  mentioned under clause  (a)  of  sub- section (1) of Section 32 F of the said Act. In the  present case, there is no dispute that the son of the appellant  who was joint with her did not fall within any of the categories referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 32 F of  the said Act. In these circumstances, Dayanu became  the owner  of  the  said land on the tillers’ day  as  a  deemed predecessor  and the appellant lost her rights in  the  said land. Notice given thereafter is of no avail. The appeal fails and is dismissed with no order as to costs.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.   2641  OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C)No. 915/2007) Leave granted. Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties we are inclined to dispose of the appeal itself. As will appear from the materials on record, the appellant was running a garage on the property which forms the subject matter of the appeal, and was sought to be acquired at the instance of the respondent No.2 which is a statutory trust. After award had been passed under Sec.11, possession was alleged to have been taken over by the Land Acquisition Collector on 17.2.2004 under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.  From the letter written by the Special Land Acquisition Collector to the -2- solicitor of the appellant, possession was made over by the Collector to the Chief Executive Officer of the respondent No.2 immediately after possession was taken under Sec.16 of the aforesaid Act. It is the appellants’ case that physical possession had not been taken by the Collector and subsequently he was dispossessed by the respondent No.2 and that in the process various articles said to have been kept in the premises had been removed. The appellant in the meantime filed a writ petition  in the Bombay High Court in its Original Side challenging the Notification under Sec.6 of the Land Acquisition Act and in the said writ petition Notice of Motion was taken out praying for certain interim reliefs which were, however, refused.  Subsequently, another Notice of Motion also for interim reliefs, including a prayer for expeditious hearing of the writ http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 petition, was dismissed.  It is against the order of the dismissal of the Notice of Motion dated 21.3.2005 that the present appeal has been filed wherein the interim prayers made before the High Court have been sought to be reiterated. Such prayers also include the restoration of the materials alleged to have been removed form the premises after physical possession was taken over by the respondent No.2. -3- At this juncture it may be indicated that the appellant has also filed a Reference petition under Sec.18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, which is pending before the Special Land Acquisition Judge and is yet to be disposed of.  The owner of the property has also filed a reference and both are pending. From the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No.2 in this Court the claim of the appellant in the reference has been set out and it includes the claim for the damage sustained on account of removal of the goods which were said to have been kept in the premises in question. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court except to the extent that the High Court, if possible, should try and dispose of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible, preferably within  a period of three months from the date of communication of this order. -4- We also make it clear that we have not gone into the merits of the claims made on behalf of the appellant and the appellant would be entitled to proceed with the same before the Reference Court or before any other Forum as may be available to the appellant.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NO 1980 OF 2008 (arising out of SLP ( C ) No. 3643 of 2007) HARJIT SINGH BEDI,J. 1.      Leave granted. 2.      This appeal by way of special leave is based on the following facts. 3.      The respondent Rajesh Kumar Saxena was placed under suspension vide order dated 26th June, 2004 under sub-rule(1) of Rule 10 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1965 on the allegation that while working as an Officiating Chief Accounts Officer in Moradabad in the year 2003, he had failed to maintain absolute integrity and shown lack of devotion to duty.  The appellant however attained the age of superannuation during his suspension and was retired provisionally on 31st July, 2004 as per order Annexure P-2, with the stipulation that as per the Central Civil Services Rules (Pension Rules) 1972 the payments due to him would be made on finalization of the disciplinary proceedings. The order dated   26th June, 2004 was challenged before the Allahabad High Court by way of a Writ Petition. The Division Bench of the High Court in its order dated 23rd November, 2006 held that as the charge sheet had been served on the appellant more than one year after his retirement, the proceedings against him were nonest and that as suspension itself was not a punishment and that in any case, it would ’evaporate’ on his superannuation,  there was no justification in withholding the retirement benefits such as pension, provident fund, leave salary, group insurance, CDS amount etc. and a direction was issued to make all payments within a period of two months from the date of communication of the order. It is in this circumstance, the present appeal is before us by way of special leave at the instance of the department. 4.      Several arguments have been raised by the learned counsel for the appellant during the course of the hearing and reference has been made to various rules. Special reference has  however been laid on the fact that very serious allegations of misconduct on the part of the respondent and 30 other departmental officers who too had been suspended had been revealed during investigation. 5.      The learned counsel for the respondents has however pointed out that the question as to whether initiation of proceedings could or could not be made after the retirement of the respondent and as to whether the chargesheet had been served within the requisite period had been raised in this http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appeal and which needed to be answered before a reversal of the High Court’s judgment. We are however of the opinion that at this stage we are not called upon to go through these issues as to do so could have the effect of damaging the cause of one or the other party in the departmental proceedings that are presently going on and in particular, those amongst the suspended officials who are not before us in this matter.  We are accordingly of the opinion that as per the rules, the respondent would be entitled to the payment of provisional pension and to the release of his provident fund alone and he would have to await the decision on the enquiry before the release of the other retiral benefits. We also make it clear that as we have not dealt with the basic legal issues raised by the parties, they would be at liberty to raise them at any subsequent stage should the need so arises. We allow the appeal to the above extent.  The order of the High Court shall be deemed to be modified in the above terms.","The respondent Rajesh Kumar Saxena was placed under suspension vide order dated 26th June, 2004 under sub-rule(1) of Rule 10 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1965.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  arises out  of the order of the Delhi High Court in  Writ Petition  No. 3695  of 1990 made on April 30, 1991. The  appellant was appointed initially on ad hoc basis on March,  3, 1987 and thereafter with a view to regularises his services, he was put on probation. During probation, his services having  been found  to be  not  satisfactory,  were terminated  by   proceedings  date  December  1,  1989.  The appellant  came  to  challenge  the  same  by  filling  writ petition in  November 1990  which was  dismissed by the High Court the this appeal by special leave. It  is  contended  by  the  appellant  that  since  the averments made  in the  counter would  constitute foundation for dismissal  for misconduct, an enquiry in this behalf was required to  be made.  On the other hand, it is contended by the respondent  that during  the probation the appellant did not acquire  any right  to  the  post.  If  on  being  found suitable  he  was  regularised,  only  then  he  would  have acquired  the   right  to   continue  in  the  post.  During probation,  it   was  found   that  his  services  were  not satisfactory and reasons were given in support thereof. Thus they do  not constitute  foundation but  motive to terminate the services.  We  find  force  in  the  contention  of  the respondent. They  have explained  that the  driving  of  the staff car  was not  satisfactory and  that, therefore,  they have  terminated   the  services  of  the  appellant  during probation. They  very object of the probation is to test the suitability and  if the  appointed authority  finds that the candidate  is  not  suitable,  it  certainly  has  power  to terminate  the   services  of   the  employee.  Under  these circumstances, it  cannot  but  be  held  that  the  reasons mentioned  constitute   motive  and   not   foundation   for termination of  service.

In a suit for specific performance of an agreement entered into between the appellan ts and the respondent filed by the respondent, the Trial Court framed a preliminary issue under Section 9A of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) which is to the following effect : ""Whether this Court is having jurisdiction to entertain the suit."" The said issue was answered in favour of the respondent.  Aggrieved thereby, the appellants filed Civil Revision Application before the High Court of Bombay.  The High Court, by its order dated 15th July 2002, set  aside the order of the Trial Court and remanded the matter for consideration afresh.  The said order of the High Court was challenged by the respondent in this Court.  This Court, by an order dated 18th November 2004  set aside the said order of the High Court and requested the High Court to dispose of the Civil Revision Application at an early date after considering the relevant law including the judgments, viz., Modi Entertainment Network v. W.S.G. Cricket Pte. Ltd. (2003) 4 SCC 341 and Modi Roland Druckimachinan AG v. Multicolour Offset Ltd. & Anr. (2004) 7 SCC 447 and remitted the matter back to the High Court for fresh decision in accordance with law.

Mannan Beskar & Ors. 2006(4) Bom.C.R. 217, held that Section 9A of the CPC stands repealed by reason of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 1999 and Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2002 passed by the Parliament. While deciding the Civil Revision Application, the learned Single Judge appears to h ave lost sight of the fact that the aforementioned decision of the learned Single Judge had been referred to a larger Bench of the High Court and has decided the application without taking note thereof.  Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellants have filed this appeal.

We are now informed that the Division Bench of the High Court, by its order dated 29 th November 2007, has taken the view that Section 9A remains on the Statute in the State of Maharashtra.

" JUDGEMENT This  appeal  against  the  order  of  the   Central Administrative  Tribunal  deserves to be dismissed as we are of the opinion that  the  view  taken  by  the  Tribunal  is correct. The  only  question  raised  before the Tribunal was whether appellant nos.  2 & 3 were entitled to  the  benefit of  one  increment  under  Fundamental  Rule  22-C  on their promotion from the post of Technical Assistant to  the  post of office  Superintendent  Grade-II  in  1988.  The Tribunal held that appellant nos.  2 & 3 were governed by Rule  7  of the  Civilians in Defence Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 1986 and not by the Fundamental Rule 22-C.  We are  also  of  the opinion that  the  appellant  nos.  2 & 3 being civilians in defence services the specific rule applied to them  and  not the general  provision  contained in FR 22-C.  Moreover, the two cadres of Technical Assistant and Office  Superintendent Grade-II  stood  merged  with effect from 1.1.86 and the two pay-scales attached to theirr cadres also merged with effect from the same date. Therefore, there could not have been any promotion within the cadre in the year 1988. That being  so, the  situation  of  qranting  benefit under Fundamental Rule 22-C did not arise at all because there were no promotion to a higher post or to a post carrying higher  duties.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned single  Judge of  this Allahabad High Court, made on  April 21,  1978 confirming  the decree of the trial Court and  appellate Court  granting a  perpetual injunction against the  appellant and  the second defendant restraining them from making any construction on the land in dispute, as shown in  the map  annexed to  the plaint and also mandatory injunction to  demolish the  construction in  so far  as  it relates  to  the  construction  on  such  land.  The  second defendant remained  ex-parte in  the  trial  Court  and  the decree as  against him had become final. The appellant/first defendant carried  the matter  in appeal which was confirmed and the  second appeal  was filed. Counsel appearing for the appellant made  a statement  on December 6, 1976 that he was not seeking  any relief against the second defendant and the decree as  against the second defendant having become final, he was  not proposing  to take  out any service of notice on the second  defendant. As  a result, the Court noted on that date that  ""The effect  thereof should  be  brought  to  the notice of  the court""  when the  appeal was  to be  heard on merits. Consequently,  when  the  matter  had  come  up  for hearing on  merits,  the  learned  Judge  proceeded  on  the premise that  the decree  as against  the  second  defendant being joint  and inseperable,  the same had become final, as against the  second defendant; it was abated and so it would not be  proper to  go into  the merits  in the  matter. As a consequence, the  appeal also  was dismissed  without  going into the  merits, as  contended by the appellant. Thus, this appeal. Palpably, the  view taken  by the  High  Court  is  not correct. The  question of  abatement of  the appeal does not arise because  this is  not a  case of  any of  the  parties expiring pending  proceedings followed  by omission to bring the legal representatives on record. In that situation only, the appeal  gets abated.  But when the decree as against one of the  defendants  has  become  final  and  is  either  not contested or  is not  carried in  appeal, the decree becomes enforceable as against the defendant who suffers the decree. But when  one of  the defendants contests the correctness of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the decree,  necessarily, it  has to be examined whether the finding recorded  and the  decree passed by the trial Court, as affirmed  by the appellate Court, is correct in law. But, unfortunately,  the   High  Court  has  not  gone  into  the question. The  only course  then open  is remittance  of the matter for  consideration  by  the  High  Court  on  merits. Unfortunately, this  Court has  dispensed with  the printing and directed  the appeal  to be  heard on  the basis  of the material placed in the SLP pater book, The appellant has not placed on record the judgment and decree of either the trial Court or  the appellate Court. Under these circumstances, we are not in a position to know what were the reasons given by the trial  Court and  as affirmed  by the appellate Court in granting the  decree  against  the  appellant.  Under  these circumstances, we  think that  no useful  purpose  would  be served in remitting the matter after two decades. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. No costs.","This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  learned single  Judge of  this Allahabad High Court, made on  April 21, 1978 confirming  the decree of the trial Court and appellate Court.

This appeal is filed by the widow and son of one Suresh Tiwary who was a Havildar in the police department in the district of Munger, Bihar. In the year 1988, he was transferred from Munger to Siwan District. He did not join at the transferred place and has been missing ever since 1988. The first appellant made an application in 1998 requesting that either her husband be traced or her son (second appellant) be granted appointment on compassionate grounds. The department considered the matter and declared the missing person \026 Suresh Tiwary - dead by order dated 26.3.2002. Thereafter the second appellant filed an application for appointment on compassionate grounds. The respondent State rejected the application on 9.4.2002 on the ground that there was no provision for giving appointment on compassionate grounds to the dependant of a missing government servant. The writ petition filed by the appellants challenging the said order was rejected by a learned single Judge on 18.8.2003. The appellant filed an L.P.A. and a Division Bench of High Court of Patna dismissed the appeal, which is challenged in this appeal. It is admitted by the learned counsel for the State of Bihar that there is a scheme for appointment on compassionate grounds as per Annexure-R-2. The rejection is on the ground that there is no provision for compassionate appointment of dependants of missing persons. But in this case, Suresh Tiwary was declared as dead only by order dated 26.3.2002. In the peculiar facts and circumstances, the fourth respondent is directed to consider the claim of the second appellant in accordance with the scheme for compassionate appointment, and if found eligible, offer him appointment.

" ORDER Consequent upon a charge sheet  (challan)  submitted by the police and a committal enquiry that followed, the two appellants  and  others  were  placed  on  trial  before  an Additional Sessions Judge, Ferozpur. The trial ended  in  an acquittal of all of them; and aggrieved thereby, Birbal, the complainant,  filed  an  appeal  before the High Court after obtaining leave under Section 378(4) Cr.P.C. In disposing of the appeal the High Court set aside the acquittal of the two appellants and convicted them under Section  302/34  I.P.C., while  upholding  the  acquittal of others. Aggrieved by the order of the conviction and sentence recorded  against  them the appellants filed this appeal under Section 379 Cr. P.C. Since  the appeal must succeed on a pure question of law, we need not go into the facts of the case.  Admittedly, the cognizance in the instant case was taken upon  a  police report under Section 190(1) (b) Cr.  P.C.Resultantly, it was the  State  alone who could file an appeal in the High Court against the order of acquittal under Section 373(1)  Cr.P.C. after  obtaining leave under sub-section (3, thereof and not the complainant who could only  file  an  application  under Section 401 Cr.

On this score alone, we allow this appeal and restore  the  order  of the trial Court.  The High court will now  treat  the  memorandum  of  appeal  filed  by  the complainant  as  an application for revision of the order of the Sessions Judge, qua the two appellants only, and dispose of the same in accordance with law.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 451-453   OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos.5728-5730/2007] Leave granted. The parties during the pendency of the appeal filed before the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi (being Criminal Appeal No. 192/2001), entered into a settlement. Pursuant to and/or in furtherance of the said Settlement the appellant withdrew the said Criminal Appeal No.192/2001 unconditionally and by an order dated 24.4.2003 the same was disposed of in terms of the Memo of Settlement arrived at between the parties. Our attention has been drawn to the said Memo of Settlement, from a perusal whereof it appears that the first respondent herein had lodged a First Information Report against the appellant, being FIR No. 316/1993 P.S. Samaypur Badli. In respect of the said First Information Report, respondent No.1 made a statement before the High Court that the proceedings would be dropped. However, recourse thereto was not taken by the respondent No.1. Appellant herein filed an application for enforcement of the terms of the said Memo of Settlement. By an order dated 18.11.2006 the same was dismissed by the High Court stating: \023This application has been moved for enforcement of memorandum of understanding arrived at between the parties pursuant to which the appellant withdrew Crl. No. 192/2001. It is contended before us that this memorandum of understanding should be enforced by this Court. We find that the memorandum of understanding deals with cases which are not compoundable. This Court cannot, therefore, force party to enter into an agreement which is otherwise prohibited by law. Application dismissed.\024 An application for review of the said order has also been dismissed by another Division Bench of the High Court opining that the Court had no power to review. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that a Settlement should be given effect to in its entirety or not at all. It may not be given effect to in part. A party to the said Settlement cannot get advantage of a part thereof and refuse to implement that part of the Memo of Settlement in terms whereof he has some role to play. Learned counsel for the respondents states before us that in view of the fact that i n the said criminal proceedings, a charge-sheet has been submitted and an order taking cognizance has been passed, the first respondent being merely an injured witness cannot withdraw the criminal case and/or take any part in getting the First Information Report quashed by the High Court. Technically, the learned counsel for respondent No.1 is correct. However, the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 respondent knew about the legal position when the said Settlement was arrived at. He having entered into the said settlement, in our opinion, cannot be permitted to resile therefrom. We would assume that the said settlement is illegal being contrary to public policy. If that be so, the entire settlement, in our opinion, should be set at naught. A party to an illegal settlement, it is well settled, cannot take advantage thereof. We, therefore, are of the opinion that in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and with a view to do complete justice between the parties, not only the impugned orders dated 18.11.2006, 8.5.2007 but also the Settlement dated 22.4.2003 should be set aside and direct restoration of the criminal Appeal No.192/2001 to its original file.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act 1  of 1894  was published  in 1981  and the  award under Section 11  was made on May 9, 1984 awarding compensation at the rate  of Rs.110/- per sq. yd. On reference under Section 18 the  learned single  Judge enhanced  the compensation  to Rs.300/ per  sq. yd.  by award and decree dated February 19, 1992 but  disallowed  interest  in  view  of  the  agreement between the  parties. Dissatisfied  therewith, the appellant has come  forward with  this appeal by special leave against the order  of the  High Court  dated July 14, 1994 in Appeal No.114/92. The  only   question  is  whether  the  appellants  are entitled to  the interest as amended under the Amendment Act 68 of  1984. Admittedly,  the appellants had entered into an agreement and the relevant part thereof reads as under: ""That the  Corporation shall pay an amount   of   Rs.98,480/-   (Rupees Ninety Eight  Thousand Four Hundred Eighty   only)   being   2/3rd   of compensation to  be  calculated  at the interim  rates of  Rs.40/-  for the said property more particularly described  in  the  First  Schedule hereunder written  on the execution of this  agreement and  the balance amount of  the compensation  as may be   awarded    under   the    Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall be paid to the owners with interest thereon at the  rate of  4% per  annum from the date of possession."" A reading  thereof clearly  indicates  that  they  were agreeable for  payment of  a sum  of Rs.98,480/-  only being http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 2/3rd of  the compensation  to be  calculated at the rate of Rs.40/- per sq. yd. more particularly described in the First Schedule on  execution of  the agreement.  For  the  balance amount they  requested the authorities to award compensation under the  Act, But  they contracted for payment of interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of possession. Sub-section (2)  of Section  11 of  the  Act  rends  as under: ""(2)    Notwithstanding    anything contained in sub-section (1), if at any stage  of the  proceedings, the Collector is satisfied that all the persons interested  in the land who appeared before  him have agreed in writing  on   the  matters   to  be included  in   the  award   of  the Collector in the form prescribed by rules  made   by  the   appropriate Government, he  may, without making further  enquiry,   make  an  award according  to  the  terms  of  such agreement."" Therefore, notwithstanding  anything contained  in sub- section (1),  the Land  Acquisition Officer  is entitled  to award interest  as per  the contract  entered  into  by  the authorities.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 6240 of 2006) MARKANDEY KATJU, J. Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.9.2004 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 631 of 2000. The prosecution version is that the accused Shankar Wadu is the brother of Mahu Wadu who was assaulted by him, which assault resulted in his death.  The incident occurred around 8.P.M. on 22.10.1995 at Kainad Wadu Pada, Laluka Wada, District Thane, where both the accused and the victim were residing along with other close relations.  According to the prosecution case, the accused wanted to keep Kamlibai, the widow of his brother Vasant, as his mistress, but she refused to be his mistress.  On the day of the incident the appellant was forcibly trying to drag Kamlibai to his house.  At that very time, he was told by his brother Mahu (the deceased) that he could not force and drag Kamlibai to his house.  At this intervention, the accused got enraged by such unwarranted advice and therefore lifted a wooden plank (pat) and hit Mahu with it on his head, and also kicked and punched him.  Mahu died on the spot.  Complaint of this assault was lodged by one Yeshubai who is closely related to both the accused and the victim. On receipt of this report the investigation was conducted and the accused was arrested.  The prosecution examined as many as eight witnesses to prove its charge of murder against the accused and the learned trial Judge on appreciation of the evidence came to the conclusion of guilt and convicted the accused and sentenced him to life imprisonment under Sections 302/506 IPC and also imposed a fine. Against the judgment of the trial court, the appellant filed an appeal before the High Court which has been dismissed by the impugned judgment and hence this appeal by way of special leave. We have gone through the record and we agree with the view taken by the courts below that the appellant is guilty.  There are eye witnesses of the incident and we see no reason to disbelieve their testimony.  These eye witnesses also include Kamlibai (PW4).  The allegation of the prosecution that it was because of Kamlibai that the incident occurred is proved by Kamlibai herself who is corroborated in all material particulars by PW-1 and PW-2.  PW-3 Yesubai is also an eye witness and we see no reason to disbelieve her evidence.  The medical evidence corroborates the prosecution case.  The post mortem report shows a fracture on the scalp of the deceased caused by a hard and blunt object, and according to the doctor this was sufficient to cause death. Both the courts below have carefully considered http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the evidence on record and we see no reason to take a different view. However, we are of the opinion that the case comes under Section 304/Part 2 and not under Section 302 IPC since the incident occurred in a sudden fit of anger.  The decisions cited by learned counsel for the appellant vide Pappu vs. State of M.P. (2006) 7 SCC 391 and Sukhbir Singh vs. State of Haryana (2002) 3 SCC 327 are apposite to this case. Hence, we convert the conviction under Section 302 to Section 304//Part 2 IPC and quash the conviction under Section 506. The appellant has already undergone 11 years’ imprisonment. Hence, we reduce the sentence to the period already undergone and we quash the fine imposed. The appellant shall be released from jail custody forthwith unless wanted in connection with some other case. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.",Shankar Wadu was convicted of the murder of his brother Mahu Wadu in 1995. He was sentenced to life in prison.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appellant  herein is the window of Late Bipin Kumar Rai who was a temporary Railway servant in this manner : He, initially, was  taken in  the  Railway  Establishment  as  a casual worker;  and w.e.f. 27.4.83 he acquired the status of a ‘substitute’.  According to  the definition  given in Rule 2315 of  the terms and conditions applicable to ‘substitute’ in temporary service, they are persons engaged in the Indian Railway  Establishments   on  regular   scales  of  pay  and allowances  applicable  to  posts  against  which  they  are employed. These  posts may  fall  vacant  on  account  of  a railway servant  being on leave or due to non-avilability of permanent or  temporary railway servants and which cannot be kept vacant. The deceased kept working as a ‘substitute’ till 5.1.87 when he  died. But,  before his  demise, he  came to acquire certain rights  and privileges  under Rule 2318 of the Rules applicable to Railway Establishments. The said rule provides that substitutes  shall  be  afforded  all  the  rights  and privileges  as   may  be  admissible  to  temporary  railway servants, from  time to  time, on  completion of  6  months’ continuous service.  Indubitably, the  deceased  had  worked beyond 6  months and  that too continuously. Having become a temporary servant  in this  manner, he  became  entitled  to family pension  under sub-rule 3(b) of Rule 2311; whereunder it is  provided that the widow/minor children of a temporary Railway servant,  who dies  while in service after a service of not  less than  1 year  continuous  (qualifying)  service shall be  eligible for a family pension under the provisions of para 801 of the Manual of Railway Pension Rules. Further, in their  case the  amount of death gratuity admissible will be reduced  by an  amount equal  to the employee’s 2 months’ pay on  which the death gratuity is determined. The Railways http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 have paid to the appellant gratuity under this sub-rule, but have denied  to her the family pension. Her claim before the C  A   T,  Patna  Bench,  Patna,  was  dismissed  which  has culminated into this appeal. On the  acquisition of  temporary status derived in the manner stated  above, it  is difficult to sustain the orders of the  Tribunal and to deny family pension to the widow and children of the deceased. See in this connection for support L Robert D’Souza Vs. Ex. Engineer, Southern Railway and Anr. (1982 1  SCC 645  and U.O.I. and Ors Vs. Basant Lal and Ors. (JT 1992  (2) SC  459). We  have put  the proposition to the learned counsel  appearing for the Railways but he is unable to support  the orders  of the  Tribunal; overlooking  as it does the chain in consequence, making the deceased acquire a temporary status  and on  his demise  his widow and children acquiring the right to claim family pension. We, thus,  allow this  appeal; set  aside the  impugned orders of the Tribunal and allow the claim to family pension as projected by the appellant. We also direct the railway to work out  the pension  due within  2 months  from today  and deliver the  pension as  also the  arrears to  the appellant within 15  days thereafter,  if not  earlier  and  also  pay interest at  the rate  of 12% per annum from the date it was due till payment.

The primary  contention of  the appellant  which  prima facie appeals  us is  that since  the appellant was a casual worker and  attained the  temporary status, throwing him out of service  while his  junior was  retained, is an arbitrary action. we  gave notice  to the  respondents by  order dated April 30,1996 directing them to explain as under: ""Learned counsel for the petitioner pointed  out   Annexure-AA  to  the petitioner    was     engaged    as Choukidar on  January   13,1986 and he was  conferred temporary  status on January 8,1967.

Under   these circumstances, notice must be deemed to have been served. Leave granted. The only  question is:  whether,  the  High  Court  can direct the  appellant to  deposit the  decretal amount  with costs of  Rs.7,500/- as  a condition to setting aside the ex parte decree?  The respondent laid the suit to recover a sum of Rs.1,46,820/- against the appellants. The suit came to be decreed ex  parte. The  appellant has  filed an  application under Order  9 Rule 13 CPC to set aside the ex parte decree. The trial  Court set  aside the  ex patre  decree subject to payment of  Rs. 50/-.  The High  Court in the impugned order dated January  8, 1992  in CR no 694/91 allowed the revision and set  aside the order of the trial Court and directed the appellants to  deposit the  decretal amount  and the  costs.

When an appellate power is exercised on an appeal filed against the  decree of  the trial Court, the Court exercises judicial discretion to grant condition stay of the execution of money  decree resonably  based on fact situation. In this case, there  is no  appeal before  the High Court against ex parte decree  of the  trial Court  itself set  aside the  ex parte decree  subject to  the  payment  of  the  cost.  When revision was carried, the High Court properly considered the facts to  set aside  the ex parte decree and the case called for interference.  It  cannot  exceed  its  jurisdiction  in directing the  appellant  to  deposit  the  entire  decretal amount and  also the  cost of  Rs. 7.500/-.  The explanation given by  the state  is  well  justified  as  no  one  takes responsibility for  the lapses.

" SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI,  J. The petitioner seeks review of our order dismissing S.L.P.(C) No.203 of 2002 in limine on January 21, 2002. In the academic year 2000-2001 the petitioner took admission in B.D.S. in M.M. College of Dental Science and Research (Mollana) Ambala but subsequently she withdrew from the course.  However, she appeared in the entrance examination of MBBS/BDS courses in Haryana for the academic year 2001-02 and secured 37th rank.  According to her she was entitled to admission in MBBS course in the Rohtak Medical College, Rohtak.  In view of clause 18 of the Information Brochure of Kurukshetra University, Haryana, for MBBS/BDS Entrance Examination (for short, ’the Information Brochure’) she apprehended that she would not be considered for admission to the MBBS course so she filed writ petition (Civil Writ Petition No.11443 of 2001) challenging validity of clause 18 of the Information Brochure and seeking a mandamus to the respondents to permit her to compete for admission to MBBS course ignoring the said clause.  By order dated November 8, 2001, the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh upheld the validity of the said clause and negatived her claim for admission to MBBS course.  She unsuccessfully challenged validity of the said order of the High Court in the aforementioned special leave petition which was dismissed by our order, now under review. It is submitted by Mr.K.V.Viswanathan, the learned counsel for the petitioner, that clause 18 of the Information Brochure cannot be so interpreted as to debar her from seeking admission to the course for all time to come and if the order is not reviewed she would be precluded from seeking admission in the MBBS course forever which is an unintended punishment.  Mr.Sanghi would contend that clause 18 bars a student who has taken admission in one course, to seek admission in another course. It will be useful to refer to clause 18 which reads as under : ""18. The candidates already admitted in any Medical/Dental Colleges will not be considered eligible for admission to the Course."" A plain reading of the afore-mentioned clause shows that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 a candidate who was already admitted in a medical or dental college would be ineligible for admission in the other course. The said clause at times will operate harshly as in the case of the petitioner but it is meant to ensure that a candidate who has already secured admission should not abandon the studies after the commencement of that course to seek admission in another course which is in public interest, for otherwise it would result in the wastage of the seat in the course in which he has taken admission and further such a change would deprive another eligible candidate from seeking admission to the other course. Obviously, the intention of the concerned authority in framing clause 18 appears to be to ensure that a candidate who has already secured admission with his free will in any course (MBBS or BDS) should complete that course and should not change his mind in midstream.  It, therefore, follows that the bar is intended to be operative during the period of the course in which a candidate has taken admission. After completing that course or in the event of abandoning the course (MBBS/BDS) and not studying for the normal period (4 years/5 years as the case may be) the candidate would become eligible after the end of such period of the course to seek admission in the course of his choice provided other conditions of admission are satisfied. In other words, the bar under clause 18 in this case will cease after the BDS course for the academic year 2000-2001, in which the petitioner has taken admission comes to an end after 5 years.  In the light of the above observations the petitioner will be free to seek admission in the course of her choice after the end of the BDS course which commenced in 2000-2001. We dispose of the review petition accordingly.  No Costs.",In the academic year 2000-2001 the petitioner took admission in B.D. in M.M.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 7815 of 2004) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Appellant calls in question legality of certain directions given by a Division bench of the Jharkhand High Court while dealing with a petition styled as Public Interest Litigation (in short the ’PIL’). The writ petitioner i.e. respondent no.1 filed the purported PIL alleging that the construction of certain multi- storeyed buildings was sanctioned illegally and contrary to the provisions of the Regional Development Authority Act (in short the ’Act’) and the Building Regulations (in short the ’Regulations’) and the Building Byelaws, 1981 (in short ’Byelaws’). The Authorities and the person who was the builder of the multi storeyed buildings appeared before the High Court, and took the stand that the PIL was nothing but a mischievous attempt to malign them. It was pointed out that the petitioner has not come to the Court with clean hand.  The High Court took note of the fact that the writ petitioner and some of his supporters had violated sanctioned plans while making constructions of buildings and the undertaking given while obtaining sanctions for their plans. Nevertheless, the High Court found that the writ petitioner may not have come to court with absolutely clean hands, but whether the Corporation was justified in according sanction was to be reconsidered by the appellant.  The High Court also directed that cases of not only the builder who had  impleaded  himself in the writ petition but  also all those who have violated the norms fixed by By-laws, sanctioned plans and undertakings shall be examined.  The directions were further to the effect that if the writ petitioner or his supporters are found to have violated the Bye-laws, he shall be proceeded against. The appellants have not questioned the correctness of these directions. However, grievance is made relating to certain observations against officers of the appellant which according to it are uncalled for.  They were not given any opportunity to be heard in the matter.  They have acted bonafide and, therefore, these observations should be deleted. It was also submitted that the Bye-laws have been amended in 2002 and while reconsideration is to be done, the same has to be in terms of Bye-laws which have come into force in 2002. Learned counsel for the respondents accepted the position that due consideration has to be done in terms of the Bye-laws introduced in 2002. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We find that without adequate material inference has been drawn by the High Court about the laxity of the Authorities.  There was no definite material about collusica or that they stood passively by winking at violation of the building Bye-laws and approved plans. These were too generalised directions. We, therefore, direct deletion of the aforesaid directions for initiating action.  We, however, make it clear that if it comes to the notice of the appellant-authority that any officer who had actually acted contrary to the best interest of the Authorities can be proceeded against in accordance with law.  In view of the accepted position that Bye-laws, amended in 2002 have applicability at the time of re-consideration of the matter, we direct that while considering the matter as directed by the High Court, the Bye-laws as amended in 2002 shall be kept in view.  But it shall also be found out if there was any violation of pre-2002 norms, necessary action shall be taken. It shall be imperative for the appellant-authority to make indepth enquiry to find out as to whether in any case or cases, the concerned officials, has/have acted in dereliction of duty. If the answer is in the affirmative, then necessary action has to follow. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 3066 of 1987. From the  Judgment and  Order  dated  9.7.1986  of  the Punjab and Haryana High Court in R.S.A. No. 163 of 1978. Mala  Ram  Ghana  and  Dalveer  Bhandari  for  the Appellant. M.S.  Gujral   and  Dr.  Meera  Aggarwal  for  the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. Special leave granted. The High  Court in  its judgment  and order  dated  9th July, 1986, has observed that the question of limitation has been  canvassed  before  the  High  Court.  The  High  Court expressed the  view that there was a lot of conflict between the various  High Courts on the interpretation of Article 54 of  the   Limitation  Act   which  governed   the  point  of limitation. The  High Court,  however, did  not decide  this question and  expressed the view that due to passage of time prices of  lands had gone up sky-high and it would be unjust to enforce  the agreement  of sale  entered into.  In  other words, it appears that without deciding the question whether the claim  of the plaintiff was barred by limitation or not, the High Court exercised its discretion in refusing to grant the relief  on the  ground that  there has been good deal of delay and  the parties  would suffer if specific performance of the agreement was granted. It appears from the facts that in this  case the major portion of the agreed price had been paid long time ago and the balance thereof was to be paid at the time  of execution  of the documents was a sum of Rs. 75 only. It further appears that possession of the premises was with the  appellant for  all these years in part performance of the agreement. In those circumstances, the principle upon which the  High Court refused to exercise its discretion, in our opinion,  was not applicable and such discretion was not proper.  The   High  Court  exercised  discretion  on  wrong principles. See  in this connection Madamsetty Satyanarayana v. G.  Yellogi Rao & Two others, [1965] 2 SCR 221; Dr. Jiwan Lal &  Ors. v.  Brij Mohan Mehra & Another, [1973] 2 SCR 230 and see  also the  observation in  Debendra Nath  Mandal  v. Sakhilal Kar & Ors., AIR 1950 Calcutta 526 In that  view of  the matter,  we  cannot  sustain  the exercise of discretion in the manner done by the High Court. This, however, does 1101 not decide  the matter because the High Court declined to go into the  facts and  decide the  question of  limitation  on merits, the  High Court  took the  view in  exercise of  its discretion. Since  we are  not sustaining  the High  Court’s exercise of  discretion hence  the order and the Judgment of the High  Court are  set aside but the matter is remanded to the High  Court for  its decision  on the merits. The matter should be  disposed  of  by  the  High  Court  as  early  as possible. The appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to costs. P.S.S.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition has been filed against the order of  the High Court of Punjab & Haryana made on May 17, 1996  in   civil  Revision   No.  1023/96.   The  respondent instituted a  suit for  declaration of his title to the land admeasuring 134  canals 14  marlas in  Hb. No.349 in village Japuwal,  Tehsil   and  District   Gurdaspur  and  also  for possession of  the property.  It is  his  case  that  he  is adopted son  of one  Isher Singh  and that  while he  was in possession and enjoyment of the property, the petitioner had disputed his  title to  and interest  in the  said land  and filed a  suit. The  petitioner had  pleaded in  the  written statement that  Isher Singh had no title in the property and they set up the title in Darbar Sahib and that he had gifted the property  in favour  of Darbar  Sahib. Subsequently, the parties, on the basis of issues raised, adduced evidence. At the  end   of  the   trial,  the  petitioner  had  filed  an application under Order 6, Rule 17, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for  amendment of  the written  statement pleading that Isher Singh  had gifted  over the  property to Darbar Sahib, Amritsar Shromani Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee and it was in possession  as a  legatee  of  the  property.  There  was neither an  issue nor  any evidence  adduced in that behalf. Therefore, the  High Court  hes set  aside the  order on two grounds,  namely,   one,  though   inconsistent  pleas   are permissible to  be taken in the written statement, this case is not  one of inconsistence but mutually destructive of the pleadings and two, for unexplained delay. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in the High Court  conceded that  there is  to explanation  for not taking that  plea in the written statement and for coming up with an  application  for  amendment  at  a  belated  stage. However, he  contended that they have remotely stated in the written statement  that Isher  Singh had gifted the property but by  way of amendment what the petitioner would be making specific amendment in the written statement. That contention was not accepted by the High Court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The same  contention has  been reiterated before us. We find no  force in  the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the pleading does contain the gift clause in the original  written statement  and that it is sought to be elaborated by  obtaining proper  documents at  this  belated stage. It  is settled  law  that  the  defendant  can  raise mutually inconsistent  pleadings in the written statement it is for  the Court  to  consider  whether  the  case  can  be properly considered  in deciding the issue. But in this case the plea  in the  written statement is mutually destructive. In the  first written  statement, they have denied the title of Isher  Singh himself. When such is the situation, how can they set  up a  title in  him and  plead gift  made by Isher Singh in  favour of  the petitioner-Committee.  Under  these circumstances, the  High Court  has rightly refused to grant the plaint.  Moreover, there  is no  explanation given as to why they  came forward  with this  plea at the belated stage after the  parties had  adduced the  evidence and the matter was to the argued. Under these circumstances, we do not find any error  of jurisdiction  or material  irregularity in the exercise of jurisdiction warranting interference. The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.","The petition was filed against the order of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana made on May 17, 1996.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.4270 OF 2002 The present appeal has been filed under Section 35L(b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (’the Act’) against the Final Order No.63/2002-C dated 15th March 2002 in Appeal No.E/2659/2001-C passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi [for short ’the Tribunal’]. The issue involved in the present appeal is whether Methane gas classifiable under Chapter Heading 2711.29 specified in the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 is liable to excise duty when consumed captively and not marketed. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the respondent-assessee was engaged i n the manufacture of de-natured Ethyl Alcohol and during the manufacture of de-natured Ethyl Alcohol, a residue known as spent wash comes into existence and the same is reacted in a closed type digester and Methane gas is produced which, in turn, is used by the respondent as fuel in distillery.  A show cause notice dated CIVIL APPEAL NO.4270 OF 2002 -2- 28th April 2000 was issued by the Revenue, the appellant herein,  to show cause as to why excise duty of Rs.17,83,678/- be not imposed on the Methane gas produced by the respondent and used captively during the period from 01.04.1995 to 31.07.1997 by invoking extended period under the proviso to Section 11A(I) of the Act. Assessee, in response to the said notice, took a stand that Methane gas produced by it is not marketable and, therefore, no excise duty could be levied on the same. The Adjudicating Authority, vide order dated 03rd April 2001, confirmed the demand. A penalty of Rs.4,50,000/- (Four Lac Fifty Thousand) under Rule 173Q of Central Excise Rules, 1944 and Rs.17,83,678/- (Seventeen Lac Eighty Three Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Eight) under Section 11AC of the Act was also imposed. Assessee, being aggrieved, filed an appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals).  The appellate authority accepted the appeal and came to the conclusion that the gas in question is not marketable.  This finding was arrived at on the basis that the burden to prove that the gas in question is marketable was on the Department and the Department failed to discharge the same.  However, no finding was recorded regarding invocation of CIVIL APPEAL NO.4270 OF 2002 -3- extended period. Revenue, being dissatisfied, filed an appeal before the Tribunal which was dismissed by the impugned order.  The Tribunal dismissed the appeal in view of the finding recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals) that the goods in question are not marketable and the Revenue had failed to produce any evidence in respect of marketability of the goods in question.  Hence, the Tribunal confirmed the order of the Commissioner (Appeals).  The Tribunal also relied upon a judgment of this Court in the case of Bhor http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Industries Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise reported in 1989(40) ELT 280 wherein it was held that marketability is an essential ingredient in order to attract excise duty on th e excisable goods under the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act. In our opinion, an article does not become liable to excise duty merely because of i ts specification in the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act unless it is salable and known to the market.  Counsel for the Revenue has very fairly stated that the Revenue had not led any evidence to show that the goods in question were marketable. The finding recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals) that the Methane gas produced by the respondent was not marketable CIVIL APPEAL NO.4270 OF 2002 -4- and as confirmed by the Tribunal is a finding of fact which does not call for any interference.  Since the Revenue had not been able to lead any evidence to show that the goods in question are marketable, in the absence of the same, it cannot be held that Methane gas was marketable and consequently the excise duty was exigible. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.  No costs.","Methane gas classifiable under Chapter Heading 2711.29 specified in the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 is liable to excise duty when consumed captively and not marketed.

As there was no evidence to show any participation by them in commission of t he offence they were given benefit of doubt. The High  Court on  reappreciation of evidence of P.Ws. 1,2 and  4 held  that their  evidence is consistent and does not suffer  from any  infirmity at all. The said 3 witnesses were in  their own  field along  with the  deceased and they were cutting  grass when  the  incident  took  place.  Their evidence clearly establishes the fact that they should lease http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the land  as it  really belong  to Ambika, accused No. 3. On being so  told, the deceased replied by saying that the land belonged to  them and  that this dispute was already settled by the Panch and there was Sulahanama in that behalf. It was at that  item that  accused Jwala  dn accused  Hardeo  fired shots from their guns and injured Nanahaku. Both the  courts below  have believed  P.Ws. 1,2 and 4. What is  contended by  the learned counsel for the appellant is that  as the  courts have disbelieved their evidence with respect to  the other accused, their evidence could not have formed the basis for the conviction of the appellants. We do not find  any substance in its contention. As stated earlier the allegation  against those  accused  was  that  they  had colluded with the harijans, that is, accused Nos. 1 to 9 and in  pursuance   of  that  collusion  the  said  offence  was committed. But  there was no evidence to prove that they had gone to  the field  where the  incident had  taken place. No other contention  was raised  by the learned counsel for the appellant. As we do not find any substance in these appeals, they are  dismissed. The appellants are ordered to surrender to  custody  to  serve  out  the  remaining  part  of  their sentence.","Criminal Appeal  No.422/89 has been filed by original accused Nos. 1,2,3,5,6 and 7.

" JUDGMENT 2000 Supp(3) SCR 100 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The petitioners are officers of the Indian Police Service (IPS) in the Arunachal, Goa, Mizoram, Union Territories Cadre. They have all been promoted to the IPS from the Delhi and Andaman Nicobar Police Services which is one of the feeder services to the IPS. The petitioners filed these petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking the following reliefs. ""Issuance of writ, order or direction quashing the notifications dated 31.12.97 being arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and for further directions that petitioners and all other similarly situated All India Service Officers may be granted all the benefits with effect from 29th April, 1985 the date of granting relief to Shri K.K.

By the date this writ petition came up for hearing to this Court, this Court had disposed of Writ Petition No. 613 of 1994 and batch filed by the Tamil Nadu Administrative Services Officers Association against the Union of India and others. At the time of admission of this writ petition on 28.7.2000 learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners are seeking a direction similar tc the one issued in the Tamil Nadu Officer’s case referred to above which has since been reported in 2000 (3) SCALE 98. After hearing learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondents, and the learned counsel for the petitioners, we are of the view that a similar direction is to be issued in this case also. We direct as follows: ""It is open to the petitioners to file a detailed representation to the Central Government, giving all the particulars of the post which they consider are fit to be encadred and special reasons why they should be encadred with a retrospective date and on such representation being made, the Central Government will consider these representations in consultation with the State Government concerned, and take appropriate decisions in this regard preferably within six months from the receipt of those representations.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard the  counsel on  both sides.  The Labour Court and the High Court in the impugned judgment dated July 29,1994 made  in CWP  Nos.10033-35 of  1994  concluded  that since the respondents had worked for more than 240 days in a year, they  were retrenched  workmen within  the meaning  of Section 2  (oo) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 [for short, ‘the Act].  Consequently, requirements of Section 25F of the Act need  to be satisfied but it was not done. So, held that the retrenchment  is void  and consequently reinstatement of the respondents  was directed.  Thus, this appeal by special leave. When we directed the appellants to furnish the crushing seasons in  which the  factory worked, they filed additional affidavit and  for the  years 1987-88  to 1993-94,  curshing seasons were given as follows : Crushing Year   Commenced on  Closed on -------------   ------------  --------- 1987-88         7.11.1987     18.4.1988 1988-89        28.11.1988     17.4.1989 1989-90        19.11.1989     30.4.1990 1990-91        25.10.1990      7.3.1991 1991-92        30.10.1991     17.4.1992 1992-93        28.10.1992     16.4.1993 1993-94         2.11.1993     10.3.1994 It would  thus be  clear that  the respondents were not working throughout  the season.  They worked during crushing seasons only.  The respondents  were taken into work for the season and  consequent to closure of the season, they ceased to work. The question  is whether  such a cessation would amount to retrenchment.  Since it  is only  a  seasonal  work,  the respondents cannot  be said  to have been retrenched in view of what  is stated  in clause  (bb) of Section 2 (oo) of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Act. Under  these circumstance,  we are  of the opinion that the view  taken by  the labour  Court and  the High Court is illegal. However,  the appellant  is directed  to maintain a register  for   all  workmen   engaged  during  the  seasons enumerated hereinbefore  and when  the new season starts the appellant should  make a  publication in neighbouring places in which  the respondents  normally live  and if  they would report  for   duty,  the  appellant  would  engage  them  in accordance with seniority and exigency of work.

" THE 26TH DAY OF JULY, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Venkataswami D.D.Thakur, Sr.Adv. and Rajeev Sharma, Adv. with him for the appellant Ashok Mathur, Adv. forth the Respondent O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: M/s. Kashmir Electric and Hardware Corporation V. State of Jammu and Kashmir O R D E R Leave granted. We have  before us  the judgment  of the learned single Judge of  the Jammu  and Kashmir High Court holding that the Arbitrator had  not misconducted himself or the proceedings. We also have before us the appellate judgment of the Letters Patent Bench  under  appeal  saying  to  the  contrary.  The misconduct blown  up is  that the  Arbitrator had  conducted sitting/sittings in the premises owned by the appellants and had during that while accepted tea and refreshment from them and   hence to  have become  guilty  of  misconduct.  It  is admitted that  he was  not alone  in that regard as both the contesting parties before him had equally shared  the use of the premises for the purpose as well as refreshments as part of courtesies.  No objection  of any  sort, at  any point of time, was  taken by  any one either with regard to the place of  conduct  of  the  proceedings  or  to  those  courtesies extended in  the form of refreshments. We fail to appreciate as to how could the arbitrator be presumed to have corrupted himself in  accepting those  courtesies, in  these facts and circumstances. Mr.  Ashok Mathur,  learned counsel appearing for the State of Jammu and Kashmir is candid enough to state that he  is unable  to support  the decision  of the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court in any manner.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.1066 OF 1992 O R D E R Delay condoned Leave granted in the Special Leave petition. The question  that arises for consideration is: whether the respondents  have committed  any illegality in directing the appellants  to pay  a sum  of Rs.  1  lakh  and  odd  as additional amount  as intimated  in their  calculation  memo dated August  9, 1990?  The claim  of the appellants is that the respondents  have no  power to  direct  payment  of  the additional amount  when the  appellants have already paid as per the  original demand.  It is  true that  initially,  the provisional amount  was  calculated  at  the  rate  of  cost incurred  in   the  scheme   known  as   the  Haryana  Urban Development  Housing   Scheme   in   Sector   21,   Gurgaon. Thereafter, the  appellants were  called  upon  to  pay  the additional amount.  The contention  is that  the respondents have got  no power  to call  upon the  appellants to pay the additional amount. Section 2(aa)  of the  Punjab Urban  Estates  (Sale  of Sites) Rules,  1965 defines  ""additional price"" to mean such sum of  money as  may be determined by the State Government, in respect of the sale of a site by allotment, having regard to the  amount of  compensation by  which  the  compensation awarded by  the Collector for the land acquired by the State Government of  which the site sold forms a part, is enhanced by the  court on  a reference  made under  Section 18 of the Land Acquisition  Acts 1894  and the amount of cost incurred by the State Government in respect of such reference. Explanation envisages  that ""for  the purposes  of this clause and sub-rule (1) of Rule 4, the expression ""the court means the  court as  defined in  clauses (d) of Section 3 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and where an appeal is filed, the appellate court. ’Sale price’ has been absorbed in Rule 4. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A conjoint  reading of  the above  rules would  clearly indicate that  the allottee  is liable  to pay  a sale price including the  additional price  and the  cost incurred  and also the  cost of  improvement of  the sites.  It is  to  be remembered that the respondent-HUDA is only a statutory body for catering  to the  housing  requirement  of  the  persons eligible to  claim for  allotment. They  acquire  the  land, develop it  and construct  buildings and allot the buildings or the sites, as the case may be. Under these circumstances, the entire  expenditure  incurred  in  connection  with  the acquisition of  the land and development thereon is required to be borne by the allottees when the sites or the buildings sold after  the development  are offered  on the date of the sale in  accordance with the regulations and also conditions of sale. It is seen That in the notice dated August 9, 1990, the total  area, net  area, the payable amount for the gross acreage, the  acreage left  for the  developmental  purpose, balance recoverable  from the  plot holders, plot-table area have been  given for each of the area and recovery rate also has been  mentioned  under  the  said  notice.  Under  these circumstances,  there   is  no   ambiguity   left   in   the calculations. If,  at all, the appellants had got any doubt, they would  have approached  the authority  and  sought  for further information. It is not the case the; they had sought the information  and the  same  was  withheld.  Under  these circumstances, we  do not  find any illegality in the action taken by  the respondents.

The  admitted position  is that  the predecessor of the  respondent   had  a  mining  lease  in  S.  NO.  14  of Venkatapura Village. The High Court has noted as under : ""Admittedly, in  the case  on hand, the plaintiff  (respondent  herein) having  purchased   the   machinery plant  installed   over  the   said extent of  the suit  land from  his vendor,  had   been  in  continuous actual  possession   thereof  since November,  1989.   It  is  also  an undisputed    fact     that     the plaintiff’s    vendor     was    in possession   and    enjoyment    of property from  1984 till  November, 1989 on  which  date  he  delivered possession to  the plaintiff  under the said agreement. Admittedly, the Government is the true owner of the suit property."" In view the above undisputed factual position, the only question for  consideration is injunction pending suit under Order XXXIX,  Rules 1  and 2, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, though the  trial Court  had not  granted the injunction and the appellate Court reversed it? The High Court on the above facts maintained ad-interim injunction, pending the suit. It is  also admitted case that the appellant has mining lease in  respect of  1 acre  16 gunthas  of land in he same survey number  in which  the respondent has bey a lease deed dated November 29, 1993. The respondent cannot unlawfully be dispossessed from the lands nor his possession and enjoyment intradicted except  in accordance  with the  due process  of law. Under these  circumstances, though  the appellant has s lease, he  cannot be  given  possession  by  the  Government http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 except after  duly ejecting the respondent a accordance with law. It  would appear  that subsequently on a representation made by  the respondent,  the  Government  acknowledged  the factum  of   his  possession   and  agreed   to  ratify  his continuance in  possession subject to his paying Rs. 12 lacs and odd  per acre  and further amount as contemplated by the Government order.

" O R D E R It is  astonishing and  we are  aghast to find that the State  Government  legitimised  corruption  and  decided  to shield the  officers who  have committed misappropriation of public funds  to the  tune of  Rs.1.61 crores  as culled out during investigation. It is obvious from the record that the Government wants to hide the persons and shield the officers responsible for  committing misappropriation.  This petition was filed  against the  order of the High Court quashing the F.I.R. filed  against the  respondent. The  High Court based its conclusion on a noting made by an officer that no action was needed.  The order  of the High Court is contrary to the fundamental principles of criminal law and the settled legal position. When  notice was  issued, the  action of the State Government compounded  the flagrant  miscarriage of justice. But when  we  have  pointed  out  to  the  counsel  for  the petitioner as to whether the charge-sheet has been filed and directed them  to produce  the  charge-sheet  and  statement under Section  161, Cr.P.C.  from November  30, 1995 despite adjournment of  the case  time and  again to produce charge- sheet filed  in the  trial Court, they failed to produce the same. So  sensing some  foul play  somewhere, by order dated April 4,  1996, this  court directed  the Chief Secretary to have an  enquiry conducted  in this  behalf and  to submit a report. In  response thereto,  pat came  on the  back to the accused and  from the  record it  would be  clear  that  the charge-sheet, though  was prepared  by  the  officer,  after thorough investigation,  the same  did not breath life since the Government  did take  a decision not to proceed with the matter. Therefore,  the decks  have been cleared in the case for the  corrupt officers, who had swindled the public money and misappropriated  it, to  escape from  clutches  of  law. Counsel for the State states before us that he does not want to proceed  with the  matter as  per the instructions of the Government. The petition  is  accordingly  dismissed.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(5) SCR 44 The following order of the Court was delivered: Civil Appeal No. 1858 of 2002: This appeal, by the Revenue, arises from the common order passed by the High Court of Gujarat on an application under Section 27(3) of the Wealth Tax Act declining to direct the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short, ’the Tribunal’) to state the case and refer to it the following question of law: ""Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts in confirming the order passed by the Commissioner of Wealth-tax (Appeals) directing the Assessing Officer to exclude the value of the assets transferred to B.O.Is. from the wealth of the assessee?"" In the order under challenge, the High Court mentioned two grounds for rejection of the application under Section 27(3) of the Wealth Tax Act, namely, (1) the decision of the Tribunal is on the question of fact emanating from the record and no question of law arises out of it; and (2) relied upon the judgement of the Gujarat High Court in Sunil J. Kinariwala v. Commissioner of income Tax, [1995] 211 I.T.R. 127. Mr. Ranbir Chandra, learned counsel for the Revenue, contends that as this Court has reversed the judgement of the High Court of Gujarat in Sunil J. Kinariwala (supra), this appeal has to be allowed. We are afraid, we cannot accede to the submission of the learned counsel. It would be useful to refer to the facts giving rise to this appeal. The respondent-assessee is a beneficiary of the main Trust. The sum (being the share income of the assessee from the partnership firm) was assigned to the Trust by the assessee. The same, along with other income of the Trust, was distributed among all the beneficiaries, including the assessee. They, in turn, assigned their respective interest in favour of Body of Individuals (B.O.Is.) and claimed that the beneficial interest derived from the firm should be assessed as assets of the B.O.Is. for purposes of valuation and not the assets of the respondent-assessee. The Assessing Officer of the Wealth Tax rejected the claim of the assessee taking the view that creation of B.O.Is. and assignment was a sham and bogus transaction. That finding was reversed, on appeal, by the Commissioner (Appeals) and the same was upheld by the Tribunal. Once it is found, as a fact, that the creation of the B.O.Is. and assignment of assets was not sham and bogus activity, the question sought to be referred would not arise and, therefore, the Tribunal under Section 27(1) of the Wealth Tax Act and the High Court under Section 27(3) of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Wealth Tax Act were right in rejecting the application of the Revenue. But then the question remains whether the fact that the High Court relied upon the judgement in Sunil J. Kinariwala (supra), which was reversed by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 1899 of 2002 Commissioner of Income Tax v. Sunil J. Kinariwala dated December 10, 2002 would make any difference to the result of this appeal. In our view, it does not as on the facts of the present case, that judgement is clearly distinguishable. The point in that case was whether there was diversion of income of the assessee to the Trust by over-riding title created in favour of the Trust, whereas in the present case, the question is whether the B.O.Is. and assignment of assets to it was sham and bogus. In our view, the High Court has erroneously relied on that judgement. Be that as it may, we have held above that on the findings recorded both by the Commissioner (Appeals) as well as by the Tribunal, the High Court was right in rejecting the application under Section 27(3) of the Wealth Tax Act. We find no merit in the appeal. It is accordingly dismissed. No costs.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arise  from the order of the High  Court of  Kerala dated  July 27,  1992 made in CRP No.695/92. The  admitted facts are that in an acquisition of the land  for public  purpose, the  reference Court  by  its award and  decree dated  March 31,  1989  had  enhanced  the compensation. The appellant had filed an application on July 29, 1991  lo review  the award and decree. There was a delay in filing  the application The learned subordinate judge had condoned the  delay.

Thus this appeal by special leave. It  is   now  settled  taw  that  when  the  delay  was occasioned at  the behest  of the  Government, it  would  be very  difficult   to  explain   the  day  today  delay.  The transaction of  the business  of the  Government being  done leisurely by  officers who  had no  or evince  no   personal interest  at  different  levels.  No  one  takes    personal responsibility in  processing the matters  expeditiously. As a fact  at several stages they take  their own time to reach a decision. Even in spite of  pointing at the delay, they do not take expeditious  action for ultimate decision in filing the appeal.  This case  is one of such instances. It is true that   Section 5 of the Limitation Act envisages explanation of the  delay to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court  and  in matters of  Limitation Act  made no distinction between  the State and  the citizen.  Nonetheless  adoption  of    strict standard of  proof leads  to grave  miscarriage of    public justice. it  would result  in  public  mischief  by  skilful management of  delay in,  the process  of filing the appeal. The approach  of  the  Court  would  be  pragmatic  but  not pedandic. Under  those circumstances,  the Subordinate Judge has rightly  adopted correct  approach and  had condoned the delay without insisting upon explaining every day’s delay Sn filing the  review  application in the light of the law laid http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 down by this  Court.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in First Appeal under Order 41 Rule 1 (r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short ’CPC’) 3.      Backgrounds facts in a nutshell are as follows: The appellants as plaintiffs filed a suit (suit No.445 of 1999) for three reliefs: (i)     The sale deed executed by defendant-respondent no.1 on 22.2.1999 in favour of defendant- respondent no.3 be declared as void. (ii)    a permanent injunction be issued restraining the defendants from dispossessing the plaintiffs from the property in dispute. (iii)   Another permanent injunction restraining the defendants no.1, 2 and 4 from letting, selling and disposing of the property. 4.      An application for injunction was also filed.  On 4.5.1999 ex-parte order of injunction was granted.  The prayer to modify the same was rejected.  On 24.11.2001 a consent order was passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.  The Division Bench directed disposal of the suit within six months and further directed maintenance of status quo of the suit property till its disposal on certain conditions. Subsequently, application was filed by respondent no.4 by making a grievance that her counsel was not heard.  It is the stand of the appellants that her defence was struck off. In any event the order was recalled on 9.1.2002. High Court dismissed the appeal holding prayer for interim injunction. 5.      It is stated by learned counsel for the appellants that the order of status quo continued for nine years and by the impugned order the position has been changed. The conditions stipulated are really of no consequential relevance, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 as in that case during pendency of the case there may be a necessity for impleading the vendees. 6.      Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand, submitted that the order is really one of concurrence and, therefore, there was no need to repeat the reasoning. 7.      We find that the order of status quo continued for considerable length of time.  It would, therefore, be appropriate to direct maintenance of status quo as was originally granted by order dated 24.11.2001.  We make it clear that by giving this protection it shall not be construed as if we have expressed any opinion on the merits of the case.

Girish Chandra for the Respondents. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The following Order of the Court was delivered: ORDER Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta, dated November 30, 1987. The respondent was posted as Public Relations Officer in the  Regional Passport Office, Calcutta. He was  transferred from Calcutta to Jaipur under the order dated 14.3.1985, and he  was relieved of his duty from Regional Passport  Office, Calcutta  w.e.f. 15.3.1985 with the direction to report  for duty at Jaipur. The respondent instead of joining at  Jaipur filed  a  writ petition before the Calcutta High  Court  and obtained  interim injunction. Later on contempt  proceedings were initiated by the respondent against the appellants  and the  High Court passed an order dated  11.10.1985  directing the  appellants to allow the respondent to join at  Calcutta office and to pay all arrears of salary to him. A number  of orders were passed by the High Court in respondent’s  favour but  all those orders have been set aside by this  Court  in Civil  Appeals arising out of Special Leave  Petitions  Nos. 6835 to 6837 of 1986. The respondent’s writ petition pending before the Calcutta High Court was subsequently  transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench.  The Tribunal  by its order dated November 30, 1987  disposed  of the  writ  petition.  The Tribunal held that  the  order  of transfer  was  not  mala fide or unfair, and  there  was  no ground  for interfering with the transfer order.  After  re- cording that finding the Tribunal directed the appellants to pay all arrears of salary with allowances to the  respondent with  a  further direction that no release order  should  be issued to the respondent unless all his emoluments are  paid to him. After  hearing learned counsel for the parties  we  find that  the  Tribunal acted in excess of its  jurisdiction  in issuing  impugned direction. The Tribunal recorded  positive findings that the transfer order was legal and valid and  it was not vitiated by any unfairness, or mala fide,  thereupon it should have dismissed the writ petition. It had no 399 jurisdiction  to  issue  further  directions  regarding  the release  order and the payment of emoluments.  The  Tribunal lost sight of the fact that the respondent had already  been released from the Calcutta office w.e.f. 15.3. 198S,  there- fore,  there  was no question of issuing any  fresh  release order.  We  accordingly allow the appeal and set  aside  the impugned directions of the Tribunal. There will be no  order as to costs. P.S.S.                                Appeal allowed. 400","The appeal is directed against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta, dated November 30, 1987.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Heard learned counsel for the parties. 2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissing the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the present appellant questioning the correctness of the order passed by a learned Single Judge. 3.      The Division Bench referred to an order of this Court in Writ Petition Nos.59-60 and 563-570/83 in the case of Surinder Singh & Anr. v. The Engineer in Chief CPWD & Ors. dated 17th January, 1986.  Except referring to the order of this Court in question, the Division Bench did not even indicate as to how the fact situation was identical.  As the order in Surinder Singh’s case (supra) shows the case under consideration was about the entitlement of daily wagers to same wages as paid to ""permanent employees"" employed to do ""identical work"".  There is no factual finding in this case that the work done was identical.  Further several other issues like entitlement to Cycle allowance, Cost of uniform, Washing allowance, Increments etc. was questioned on the ground that these are payable only to workers who are appointed to regular posts.  Unfortunately, the High Court did not consider that aspect also. 4.      That being so, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.  Since the matter is pending since long, the High Court is requested to dispose of the appeal expeditiously, preferably by the end of July, 2008. 5.      The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","The appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissing the Letters Patent Appeal.

" JUDGMENT 2000 Supp(3) SCR 102 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The maximum intake of the institution is 30 students per section. The institution has two sections. The maximum number that can be admitted is 60. The petitioners before us are the extra 15 students who were admitted, the total being 75 students. In the High Court, the students and the institution had filed a joint writ petition and failed. Hence the 15 students also have filed the S.L.P. We are not impressed by the fact that the students are before us challenging the orders of the department that they cannot be permitted to take the examination. If their admission was not valid and was beyond the permitted quota of 60, we cannot help the petitioners. Learned Single Judge and the Division Bench were absolutely right in applying the decision of this Court in State of Punjab v. Renuka Singla, AIR (1994) SC 59 (para 8) and State of Maharashtra v. Vikas Sahebrao Roundale, AIR (1992) SC 1926 and in declaring that this admission was illegal. The relevant passages of the above said judgments are as follows: State of Punjab v. Renuka Singla, AIR 1994 SC 59. ""The admission in Medical Course throughout India is governed by different statutory provisions including regulations framed under different Acts. During last several years efforts have been made to regulate the admissions to the different medical institutions, in order to achieve academic excellence. But, at the same time, a counter attempt is also apparent and discernible, by which the candidates, who are not able to get admissions against the seats fixed by different statutory authorities, file writ applications and interim or final directions are given to admit such petitioners. We fail to appreciate as to how the High Court or this Court can be generous or liberal in issuing such directions which in substance amount to directing the authorities concerned to violate their own statutory rules and regulations in respect of admissions of students"". State of Maharashtra v. Vikas Sahebrao Roundale, AIR (1992) SC 1926. ""Slackening the standard and judicial fiat to control the mode of education and examining system are detrimental to the efficient management of the education. The directions to the appellants to disobey the law is subversive of the rule of law, a breeding source for indiscipline, The High Court, therefore, committed manifest error in law, in exercising its prerogative power conferred under Article 226 of the Constitution, directing the appellants to permit the students to appear for the examination etc."". We respectfully agree with the view expressed in the above said judgments. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The Special Leave Petitions are dismissed accordingly.","The maximum intake of the institution is 30 students per section.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the single Judge of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, made on October 20, 1993 in RSA No. 2076 of 1993 dismissing the in limine. The  only  question  is  :  whether  the  appellant  is empowered to impose 15% cut in the pension of the respondent as a  measure  of  penalty.  Disciplinary  proceedings  were initiated against the respondent and pending proceedings, he retired from  service. The disciplinary authority passed the order before his superannuation on February 15, 1987 holding that misconduct  on his  part was  established;  however,  a minor penalty  was imposed.  But the  higher  authority,  on appeal, gave notice to the respondent and disagreed with the disciplinary authoritys’s  conclusion and imposed 15% cut in the pension  payable to  the respondent by proceedings dated March 30, 1989. The respondent filed a civil suit. The trial Court decreed  the suit. On appeal, it was confirmed and the second appeal, as stated earlier, was dismissed in limine. It is  seen that  notice was  issued by  this Court  by order dated  April 19, 1996 confined to the question whether the power  of the authority to withhold whole or any part of the pension  is correct  or not. It is seen that Rule 15 (v) (c) of  the Punjab  Civil Services  (Punishment and  Appeal) Rules, 1970 provides that ""subject to the provisions of Rule 14, a  Government employee  may prefer an appeal against all or any  of the  orders and while disposing of the appeal the appellate authority  has power  to  order  (c)  reducing  or withholding the  pension  or  denying  the  maximum  pension admissible to  him under  the rules"". It is contended by the learned counsel  for the  respondent that Rule 11 casts duty to supply  enquiry report  along with  the penalty which has not been supplied. Therefore, the order is violative of Rule 11 of  the Rules.  We find no force in the contention. It is seen that  the impugned order came to be passed on appeal by the appellate  authority. We  have already  held that it has the power  and authority to impose cut in the pension. It is not a  case where  the primary authority imposed any penalty http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 without supplying  copy of  the report  and action was taken thereon. Under  these circumstances, though Rule 11 provides for the supply of copy of the enquiry report, the infraction thereof makes  no difference  in view  of the  facts in this case. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  judgment  and decree of  all the  courts stand set aside. As a result, the suit stands  dismissed.  No costs.","This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the single Judge of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, made on October 20, 1993 in RSA No. 2076 of 1993 dismissing the in limine.

" J U D G M E N T CIVIL APPEAL NO 1666 OF 2008 [Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 8217/2006] MARKANDEY KATJU, J 1.      Leave granted. 2.      This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench dated 31.1.2006 in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3812 of 2002. 3.      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 4.      The facts of the case are that the respondent in this appeal was working as a Trained Graduate Teacher (hereinafter in short ’TGT Teacher’) (Maths) in the service of the appellant which is the Kendriya Vidyalaya.  On 23.2.1999 while functioning as a TGT teacher (Maths) in the Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 1,  Air Force Suratgarh, he physically assaulted the Principal of the school in his office room which caused serious injury on the right eye of the Principal, Shri R.D. Shah.  The next day he submitted a written apology. However, he was charge-sheeted and an inquiry was held against him and the Inquiry Officer submitted his report on 24.2.2000, a copy of which is at Annexure P-4 to this appeal. 5.      The Inquiry Officer found the respondent guilty and accordingly an order of removal from service dated 1.5.2000 was passed against him by the disciplinary authority.  The respondent filed an appeal before the appellate authority which rejected the appeal. 6.      The respondent then filed an O.A. before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Jaipur.  The Tribunal was of the view that the respondent committed the act of misconduct under mental tension and he had submitted his written apology and that he has a family to maintain.  Hence, the Tribunal was of the view that the punishment of removal from service was disproportionate and, instead, the Tribunal reduced the punishment to withholding three increments for a period of five years with cumulative effect.  Accordingly, the Tribunal quashed the removal order. 7.      The appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court which upheld the view of the Tribunal and dismissed the writ petition.  Hence this appeal by way of Special Leave. 8.      We regret our inability to uphold the judgment of the Tribunal as well as of the High Court.  A teacher has to be a role model in the society.  He is a ’guru’ who sets an example for the students.  A person who physically http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 assaults the Principal of the Institution is, in our opinion, not fit to be a teacher.  He is more like a goonda.  In our opinion, therefore, there was no good ground for the Tribunal to interfere with the punishment of removal awarded to the respondent.  For the reasons given above, we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court as well as the Tribunal and restore the order of removal passed against the respondent.  The appeal stands allowed. No costs.","The appeal was filed against the impugned judgment of the Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench dated 31.1.2006 in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3812 of 2002.

" D E R Leave granted. L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J Heard learned counsel for the parties. The  appellants  challenge the order passed by the  High Court  dismissing  the  writ  petition  as  premature.   The grievance  of the appellants is that he made an  application for  the  grant of stage carriage permit as far back on  the 12th  November, 1998 but the same has yet not been  disposed of.   Thus the rejection of the appellants writ petition by the  High  Court as premature is unsustainable liable to  be set  aside.   The reply on behalf of the respondent is  that the  said application for the grant of permit was sent  only on  the  12th November, 1998, whereas the last date  of  the receipt  of the application was 31st August, 1998, hence  it was  rejected being time barred.  Thus the same was returned to the appellant along with the original bank draft by speed post with A.D.  on the 15th February, 1999.  Learned counsel for  the  appellant submits firstly that appellant  had  not knowledge  of this rejection and in any case this  rejection in view of Section 80 of Motor Vehicles Act is illegal and a nullity. Submission  on behalf of respondent is that there was  a scheme  for  the  unemployed youth by the State  of  Haryana which  is  annexed as Annexure R-2 which was  published  and notified  in  the  year 1998 under which  appellant  applied which  is  withdrawn  by  the   State  of  Haryana   through Notification dated 25th February, 2000.  Thus apart from the aforesaid  fact  of the rejection of the application of  the appellant, no relief can be granted on the said application. On  the other hand learned counsel for the appellant submits that  the application was not made under any Scheme but  was independently  under  Section 80 of the said Act.   However, this  is  disputed question of fact which has  neither  been raised  nor  adjudicated  by the High Court whose  order  is impugned  before us.  In view of this proper course open  to the  appellant  was  to have moved the High  Court  on  this subsequent   cause   of  action   instead  in  the   present proceedings.  Such a question cannot be raised for the first http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 time before this Court in the present proceedings.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the learned  single Judge  of the  Punjab and  Haryana  High Court made  in Second  Appeal No.  477/68 on  September  12, 1978. The admitted facts are that one Mathra Singh, Plaintiff No.1 and  defendant Nos.1 to 13 were partners of the factory known as  Modern Ice  Factory at Gurdaspur. A suit was filed for dissolution  of partnership  and rendition  of accounts. The  trial   Court  dismissed  the  suit.  Appeal  also  was dismissed. While  he second appeal was pending, it is not in dispute  that   two  of   the  partners  died.  Their  legal representatives were  not brought  on record.  Consequently, the High  Court dismissed the second appeal as having abated as against all the respondents. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It is  pointed out  in the  report of the Registry that respondent Nos.  8 and 14(i), pending this appeal, have also died and  no steps  have  been  taken  to  bring  the  legal representatives on  record. It  is contended by Smt. Manjeet Chawla, learned  counsel for the appellant that the original partners are  respondent Nos.2,  14 and 15. As against them, the appeal  has not been abated and the High Court was wrong in its  conclusion that  the appeal stands abated as against other persons  who have subsequently purchased the  interest of the  partners. It  is seen  that even  pending appeal the 14th respondent,  the original  partner also  died  and  his legal representatives  were brought  on  record  and    that respondent 14(i) also died. 8th respondent also died pending appeal. It is  well settled  law that when the decree is single and indivisible,  there cannot  be inconsistent  decrees  as against  the   deceased  respondents   and  the   contesting surviving respondents.  It  is  seen  that  two  respondent- partners died pending second appeal. Therefore, there cannot be any  inconsistent decree  as against the dead persons and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 against whom the decree dismissing the suit had become final and other  contesting respondents  whose rights  are  to  be adjudicated in the second appeal. It would,  therefore, be  clear that the High Court has not committed any error of law. Since the appeal has already got abated  as against  the deceased  respondents, the Court cannot  proceed   further  on   merits.  Equally,  the  same situation is confirmed in this appeal also. Since respondent Nos. 8  and 14(i)  had already  died and  their rights  have become final;  since their  legal representatives  have  not been brought  on record  and the  appeal  stands  abated  as against them,  it would  be inconsistent  if we  go into the merits of  the matter  as against the contesting respondents in this  appeal. Under these circumstances, this appeal also stands abated as against all the respondents. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" JUDGMENT Nanavati. J. The appellant has been convicted under Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act by the Designated Court,  Bhiwani  as  he  was  found  in  possession   of   a countrymade 315 bore pistol and a live cartidge. The Designated Court relying upon  the  evidence  of P.W.2  - Ganga Ram held that the allegation made against the appellant was proved and he was infect found  in  possession of a  pistol and a live cartidge.  The Designated Court also relied upon the report of Forensic  Science  Laboratory  and held that the pistol was in a working condition. What  is  contended  by  the learned counsel for the appellant is that the Designated Court failed to  appreciate that the evidence of Ganga Ram was so improbable that it did not deserve to be accepted.  As disclosed by the prosecution evidence,  a  space was registered against the appellant and seven others for the offence of murder on November  1,  1988 at Fatehabad Police Station.  The police was on look out for the appellant.     On  8th  November,  1988,  the  appellant accompanied by his maternal uncle presented  himself  before the Officer  incharge  of the Fatehabad Police Station.  SHO Ganga Ram took him in custody and at that  time  found  from his possession,  a  pistol  and  a cartidge.  No independent witness was kept present at the time of  either  taking  the appellant  into  custody or while seizing the pistol and the cartidge.  The reason given by Ganga Ram in this  behalf  is the  because his maternal uncle was present he did not think it fit to call bay other person to witness  the  seizure  of the weapon  and  the  cartidge.    This  obviously is a lame excuse.  In absence of any independent evidence, seizure  of a  pistol  and  a  cartidge from possession of the appellant becomes doubtful.    It  is  also  highly   improbable   the appellant  had  presented  himself  with  a weapon which was unlicensed.  He had not gone there to make a confession.  He had gone to the police station because he was wanted by  the police in  that  case.  No other witness was examined by the prosecution on the point of  recovery  of  a  pistol  and  a cartidge from  the  possession  of  the  appellant.   As the evidence of Ganga Ram does not appear to  be  truthful,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 conviction of the appellant will have to be set aside. We,  therefore,  allow this appeal and set aside the conviction of the appellant and also the order  of  sentence passed  against  him  and acquit him of the charges levelled against hem.","The appellant has been convicted under Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act by the Designated Court, Bhiwani.

Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arise  from the order in the contempt  proceedings dated  August 1,  1995 made by the Madhya  Pradesh   Administrative  Tribunal   at  Indore   in Miscellaneous Application No.99 of 1994. The  admitted  position  is  that  the  respondent  was appointed as  a Sub-Inspector  in the  Police Department  on January 1,  1960 and  his date  of birth  in the High School Certificate was  August  5,  1934.  In  1992,  he  filed  an application in  the Tribunal  for correction  of his date of birth contending  that his  date of birth was July 16, 1938. The Tribunal  by order  dated February  25, 1994 disposed of the  application   with  a   direction   to   consider   the representation of  the respondent.  The  representation  was considered and  rejected by  proceeding dated  May 23, 1994. Consequently, the  respondent filed  a contempt  application contending   that   the   appellants   have   wilfully   and deliberately disobeyed  the order of the Tribunal and sought for initiation  of the  proceedings against  the  appellants under Section  12 of  the Contempt  of  Court  Act.  In  the impugned order,  the Tribunal  has held  that the respondent has not  deliberately disobeyed  the orders  of the court as direction was  to consider  the case  afresh on  the finding that the Director General of Police had not applied his mind to the  issue and  therefore the  impugned order  came to be issued. The  question is : whether the Tribunal was right in its  giving  directions?  It  is  seen  that  the  Assistant Inspector  General  of  Police  who  is  the  Administrative Officer assists  the  Administrator,  namely,  the  Director General of  Police. He  had put  up the note on it and after consideration of  it the Director General of Police had made http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 a   note   ""inform   the   respondent"".   Obviously,   after consideration of  the case he did not agree wit the claim of the respondent  and accepted  the report  submitted  by  his subordinate, viz.,  Assistant Inspector  General of  Police. Thus, it  would be  a case where due consideration was given to the  respondent’s representation  as per  the  directions given by  the Tribunal.  The Tribunal  having held  that the respondent has  not deliberately  disobeyed the order, there is no power to issue further directions. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  direction are set aside. No costs.","The appeal  by special leave arise from the order in the contempt  proceedings dated August 1, 1995 made by the Madhya Pradesh   Administrative Tribunal.

" J U D G M E N T S.B. SINHA, J : While agreeing with the opinion of My Lord, the Chief Justice of India,  I would like to add only a few words. Message of charity and compassion is to be found in all religions without any exception.  Only because charity and compassion are preached in every religion, the same by itself would not be a part of the ’religious practice’ within the meaning of Article 25 of the Constitution of India. Thus, the Religion of Christianity encouraging the Christians to practise charities to attain spiritual salvation is of not much relevance for this purpose.  Such preachings are also found in Bhagavat Geeta and Upanishad. In Collins English Dictionary, ’Christian’ is defined as a person who believes in and follows Jesus Christ. Similarly, we may notice that this Court in Lily Thomas and Others vs. Union of India and Others [(2000) 6 SCC 224] in relation to the religion of  Islam observed thus : ""The word ""Islam"" means ""peace and submission"".   In its religious connotation it is understood as ""submission to the will of God""; according to Fyzee (outlines of Mohammedan Law, 2nd Edn.), in its secular sense, the establishment of peace.

The petitioners have quoted a passage purported to be from Chapter 19 of  Gospel according to  Luke.  The Holy Bible published by Gideons does not contain the said passage. Assuming that the said preachings have found place in the Holy Bible, the same ex facie would go to show that what was being preached is renouncement. Even if the said passage is taken to be correct, the same appears to be a person who had followed namely : Do not commit adultery;  do not commit murder; do not steal; do not accuse anyone falsely; respect your father and your mother.  That was an advice to a person. Renouncement of world by a person following any religion is necessarily not the essential practice of the religion which is  meant for commonness.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard  learned  counsel  on  both  sides.  The impugned order  of the  Tribunal made  in OA  No.5675/89  on March 23,  1992 is founded upon the disciplinary proceedings taken by  the appellant  for the  alleged misconduct  of the respondent by  producing a  certificates at  the time of his recruitment to  the effect that the income of his father was more than  Rs.1,000/-  per  annum.  On  that  premise,  they conducted an  enquiry under  the conduct  rules;  found  him guilty  under  Rule  6(1)  of  the  Karnataka  State  Police Disciplinary Proceedings  Rules, 1965  and imposed a penalty of stoppage  of one increment without cumulative effect. The respondent challenged  the same.  The Tribunal found that he was selected  in his  own merit  as a general candidate and, therefore, the  income has no reference. It was also found - that the  income of his grandfather from the land properties cannot  be  clubbed  as  the  concept  of  joint  family  is inapplicable to  the respondent who is a member hailing from the  majority   community  (muslim).   The  father   of  the respondent was  a petty trader. The Sales Tax Officer who is only  an   assessing  authority,   cannot  add  10%  of  his assessable income  to show  that his income is more than Rs. 750/- p.a.  On either  of these  grounds, the order imposing penalty of stoppage of one increment was held illegal. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Shri Veerappa, learned counsel for the State, contended that the view of the Tribunal is not correct in law. We find no force  in the  contention. As  seen, the vary preamble of the order  of the Tribunal does indicate that the respondent had in  fact contended  that he  was selected  as a  general candidate on  his own  merit and not as a backward class. If that be  the position,  obviously  the  income  criteria  is clearly inapplicable. Since the respondent does not have any record in  that behalf,  it is  the duty  of  the  State  to produce the  selection list  prepared by  the Public Service http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Commission to  show whether he was selected and appointed as general candidate.  That  record  has  not  been  placed  on record. Even  otherwise also,  we are  in agreement with the Tribunal in  its findings  on  merits.  The  income  of  his grandfather from  land and  properties cannot be included in his income  since the  concept of  the joint  family is  not applicable to  the presents professing Islam. The respondent being  a  Muslim  is  governed  by  his  own  personal  law. Accordingly,   the  income  of  the  grandfather  cannot  be included to  be the income of the respondent. As regards the income of  his father,  he is a petty trader. Therefore, the Sales Tax  Officer is  competent only  to assess  the annual turnover of  the income  and assessable  income  has  to  be assessed. But  his certificate  of income including 10% more on the  assessable income  cannot, therefore, be conclusive. In  either  case,  we  do  not  find  any  merit  warranting interference to produce. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.",The appeal is dismissed. No costs.  O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard  learned  counsel  on  both  sides.,special leave petitions,54.97
" O R D E R Leave granted. This  special leave petition arises from the order of the High Court of Allahabad, Lucknow Bench made on September 21, 1988 in Writ Petition No.1731 of 1984. Though the respondents had been served earlier and Sri Mukul Mudgal  who had taken notice has reported on September 1, 1995  that he  could not  appear and  stated that  he  be permitted to  withdraw from the undertaking. He has also not filed  his   Vakalatnama.  In   these  circumstances,  since respondents are  not represented,  learned counsel  for  the appellant was  directed to produce necessary material on the basis of  which respondent  Banke Singh  became owner of the land. The learned counsel has now produced the records. The  only   question  in  this  case  is:  whether  the respondents would  get benefit of l/4th share in the surplus land declared  by the  competent authority?  On September 8, 1982, Krishan Pal Singh filed objection, who claimed land of Khata Nos.  340, 341  and Khata  No.33 of village Nawada and Khata No.77  of Village  Jamla Jot  on the  basis of  a will executed by  Smt. Gajraji.  On that  basis, the said land is required to  be excluded  from the surplus land. The primary authority had  rejected the  claim by proceedings dated July 30, l983 and on appeal the District Judge allowed the appeal by order  dated November  9, 1983  and excluded 1/4th of the land held  by  Gajraji  on  the  basis  of  the  Will  dated September 2,  1978. When  it was  questioned, the High Court dismissed Writ  Petition No.1731/84.  Hence, this  appeal by special leave. Section 5  of the  U.P. Imposition  of Ceiling  on Land Holdings Act,  1960 (U.P. Act No.l of 1961) (for short, ’the Act’) in  Chapter  II  imposes  ceiling  on  land  holdings. Certain exemption  mentioned in  the Article  gets  excluded from surplus land. Section 5 postulates that on and from the commencement of  the Uttar  Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings  (Amendment) Act, 1972, no tenure-holder shall http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 be entitled  to  hold  in  the  aggregate  throughout  Uttar Pradesh, any  land in  excess of  ceiling area applicable to him. Sub-section (6) postulates determination of the ceiling area applicable  to a  tenure-holder. It  provides that  any transfer of  land made  after the  24th day of January 1971, which but for the transfer, would have been declared surplus land under  this Act,  shall be  ignored and  not taken into account. Explanation-I provides that for the purpose of this sub-section the  expression transfer  of land made after the twenty-fourth day  of January,  1971 includes,  among  other things, - any  admission,   acknowledgement,  relinquishment   or declaration in  favour of  a person to the like effect, made in any  other deed  or instrument  or in  any other  manner, shall be  construed to be a transfer for the purpose of sub- section (6). Admittedly, the  Will was executed on February 10, 1978 long after the specified date. By the Will a devise was made by Gajraji,  owner of  the land  bequeathing her 1/4th share in favour  of her brother’s grand-son, Krishan Pratap Singh. Therefore, it must be construed to be a devise ""in any other manner"" within  the meaning  of Explanation  I (b)  of  sub- section (6)  of the Act. It shall be ignored for the purpose of determination of the surplus land. the High Court and the appellate authority,  therefore, were not right in directing to exclude the said land. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","Krishan Pal Singh filed objection, who claimed land of Khata Nos. 340, 341 and Khata  No.33 of village Nawada.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court, made on June 29, 1993 in W.A. No.712/93. The  admitted   position  is   that  pursuant   to  the notification  published  under  Section  4(1)  of  the  Land Acquisition Act,  1894 [for  short,  the  ""Act""]  in  G.O.R. No.1392 Industries dated October 17, 1962, total extent of 6 acres 41 cents of land in Madhavaram village Saidapet Taluk, Chengalpattu District  in  Tamil  Nadu  was  acquired  under Chapter VII  of the  Act for  the manufacture  of  Synthetic Rasina by  Tvl. Reichold  Chemicals India  Ltd., Madras. The acquisition proceedings  had become  final and possession of the land  was taken  on April  30,  1964.  Pursuant  to  the agreement executed  by the  company, it  was handed  over to Tvl. Simpson  and General  Finance Co. which is a subsidiary of Reichold  Chemicals India  Ltd. It would appear that at a request made  by the  said company,  66 cents of land out of one acre  37  cents  in  respect  of  which  the  appellants originally had ownership, was transferred in G.O.M.S. No.816 Industries  dated  March  24,  1971  in  favour  of  another subsidiary company.  Shri Rama  Vilas Service  Ltd., the 5th respondent which  is also  another subsidiary of the Company had requested from two acres 75 cents of land; the same came to be  assigned on  lease hold basis by the Government after resumption in  terms of  the agreement  in  G.O.M.S.  No.439 Industries dated May 10, 1985. In G.O.M.S. No.546 Industries dated March  30, 1986, the same came to be approved of. Then the appellants  challenged  the  original  G.O.M.S.  No.1392 Industries dated  October 17, 1962 contending that since the regional purpose  for which the land was acquired had ceased to  be   in  operation,   the  appellants  are  entitled  to restitution of  the possession  taken from them. The Learned single Judge  and the  Division Bench  have  held  that  the acquired land  having already  vested in  the  state,  after receipt of  the compensation  by the predecessor-in-title of the  appellants,   they  have  no  right  to  challenge  the notification. Thus  the writ  petition and  the writ  appeal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 came to be dismissed. Shri G. Ramaswamy, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants,  contends that  when by operation of Section 44-B read  with Section  40 of  the Act,  the public purpose ceased to  be  existing,  the  acquisition  became  bad  and therefore, the  G.O. was bad in law. We find no force in the contention. It is seen that after the notification in G.O.R. 1392 dated  October 17,  1962 was published, the acquisition proceeding had  become final,  the compensation  was paid to the appellants’ father and thereafter the lands stood vested in the  State. In  terms of the agreement as contemplated in Chapter VII of the Act, the company had delivered possession subject to  the terms  and conditions thereunder. It is seen that one  of the  conditions was  that on  cessation of  the public purpose,  the lands  acquired would be surrendered to the Government. In furtherance thereof, the lands came to be surrendered to the Government for resumption. The lands then were allotted  to SRVS  Ltd., 5th respondent which is also a subsidiary amalgamated  company  of  the  original  company. Therefore, the public purpose for which acquisition was made was substituted  for another  public purpose.  Moreover, the question stood final settled 32 years ago and hence the writ petition cannot  be entertained  after three  decades on the ground that  either original  purpose was not public purpose or the land cannot be used for any other purpose. Under these circumstances, we think that the High Court was right in refusing to entertain the writ petition. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court, made on June 29, 1993 in W.A. No.712/93.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2476 of 1993. From  the Judgment and Order dated 21.2.1992 of  the  Orissa High Court in O.J.S. No. 4866 of 1991. 476 R. K. Mehta for the Appellants. H.L. Aggarwal, S.K. Patri, Abhijat P. Medh, Ms. Kirti Mishra and A.K.

Their termination was not approved  by the Inspector of Schools.  Since the order  not approving  termination  was  not  given  effect  to  by  the Institution the appellants approached the High Court by  way of  a  writ petition for a mandamus to  reinstate  them  and grant them their salaries from the date the school became an aided institution.  The High Court did not find any merit in the claim for various reasons. Section  10-A of the Orissa Education Act provides that  the termination  of a teacher of an aided institution  shall  be subject  to the approval of the Inspector.  Use of the  word ’aided institution’ is clear indication that the  provisions of  approval apply only to the aided schools.  Since on  the date  the  services of the appellants  were  terminated  the institution was recognised only and not aided the  Inspector could   not  have  exercised  the  power   of   disapproval. Consequently no right vested in the appellant which he could get  enforced  in a court of law.  The submission  that  the principle of Section 10-A being benevolent in nature  should be extended to teachers of the institution once it has  been granted   recognition  to  avoid  exploitation   and   undue harassment of those who are unequal in the bargain cannot be accepted.   Recognition  of an institution  for  purpose  of imparting education is different than bringing it on grants- in-aid.   To  the former the regulatory  provisions  of  the Education  Act  or the rules do not  apply.   The  Education Departments  has no control either on admission of  students or  members  of staff.  The High Court, therefore.  did  not commit any error of law in dismissing the writ petition. The  appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.   But  there shall be no order as Appeal dismissed. 477","Appellants employed in the school established in the year 1981 recognised in 1983 brought on grants-in-aid in 1988, were terminated in 1986.

" JUDGMENT 2001 (1) SCR 387 The following Judgment of the Court was delivered : Special Leave granted. The respondent was appointed to the post of Assistant Professor on 22nd September, 1990 on probation. Within the probationary period, by order dated 16th June, 1991, his services were teminated. In the order terminating the services, it was mentioned as follows: ""As a matter of policy, as usual, a committee was constituted to go into the general performance of each staff. The committee after having gone through the records of each individual right from the date of his/ her inception into the Institute is of the opinion that your on the job proficiency is not upto the mark. Hence, the Institution feels that your services are no longer required"" The aforesaid order was challenged before the Educational Tribunal on the ground that the order terminating, the appointment cast a stigma and, therefore, such an order could not be passed without holding a departmental inquiry. Before the Tribunal, the appellants herein conceded and the said order of termination was set aside. Subsequently again, within the period of probation, a fresh order of termination was passed which was as follows : ""Sri L.A. Balakrishna, Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering will be relieved of his duties with effect from 1.8.1991, he may be paid his dues if any."" This order was again challenged and the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the real reason for passing this order was that his services were found to be unsuitable and, therefore, this was by was of punishment, The order was set aside and the high Court upheld the decision of the Tribunal. Hence, this appeal. There can be no manner of doubt that the employer is entitled to engage the services of a person on probation. During the period of probation, the suitability of the recruit/appointee has to be seen. If his services are not satisfactory which means that he is not suitable for the job than the employer has a right to terminate the services as a reason thereof. If the termination during probationary period is without any reason, perhaps such an order Would be sought to be challenged on the ground of being arbitrary. Therefore, normally services of an employee on probation would be terminated, when he is found not to be suitable for the job for which he was engaged, without assigning any reason. If the order on the face of it states that his services are being terminated because his performance is not satisfactory, the employer runs the risk of the allegation being made http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that the order itself casts a stigma. We do not say that such a contention will succeed. Normally, therefore, it is preferred that the order itself does not mention the reason why the services are being terminated. If such an order is challenged, the employer will have to indicate the grounds .on which the services of a probationer were terminated. Mere fact that in response to the challenge, the employer states that the services were. not satisfactory would not ipso facto mean that the services of the probationer were being terminated by way of punishment. The probationer is on test and if the services are found not to be satisfactory, the employer has, in terms of the letter of appointment, the right to terminate the services. In the instant case, the second order which was passed terminating the services of the respondent was innocuously worded. Even if we take into consideration the first order which was passed which mentioned that a Committee which had been constituted came to the conclusion that the job proficiency of the respondent was not upto the mark, that would be a valid reason for terminating the services of the respondent. That reason cannot be cited and relied upon by contending that the termination was by way of punishment. We, accordingly, allow this appeal and set aside the decision of the Tribunal as well-as that of the High Court No costs.","Sri L.A.

The  Land Acquisition  officer awarded  compensation against  which   the  parties   sought  reference   for  re- determination of  compensation etc.  under section 18 of the Land acquisition Act.

" J U D G M E N T K.Venkataswami, J. Leave granted. Heard counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave is preferred against the judgment and  order in F.A.F.O. No. 994/94 of Allahabad High Court dated  22.9.94. The appellant while working as Beldar, to be  more specific  while pouring  water on  the wheels of road-roller moving  on the  road, met  with an  accident  on 8.5.1989. As  result of  the said  accident, the appellant’s right leg  had to  be amputated.  As the accident was due to the negligence on the part of the person who drove the road- roller belonging  to the  first  respondent,  the  appellant moved a  claim petition  before the  Motor  Accident  Claims Tribunal, Etawah,  claiming a  sum of  Rs.  5,30,000/-.  The Tribunal found  that/the negligence  was on  the part of the person who  drove the  road-roller. It  may be  mentioned at this place  that the  regular driver  who was  permitted  to drive the  said road-roller was on leave and the cleaner who had no  licence factually  drove the road-roller on the date of accident.  The Tribunal  on the  basis  of  the  evidence placed  before  it  awarded  a  total  compensation  of  Rs. 1,45,000/- with interest at 12%. Aggrieved by the ward of compensation of Rs. 1,45,000/- the respondent  preferred an  appeal to  the high Court. The learned Judge  while concurring  with  the  finding  of  the Tribunal that  the accident had occasioned on account of the negligence on  the part  of the  person who  drove the road- roller, reduced  the compensation  from  1,45,000/-  to  Rs. 85,000/- with  interest. at  12%. For reducing the amount of compensation from  Rs.1,45,000/-  to  Rs.85,000/-  the  High Court has  accepted the contention advanced on behalf of the respondents herein  (appellants before it) that the claiment would have  secured only Rs. 85,000/- by way of compensation if he  had moved the Commissioner of Workmens’ Compensation. We do  not think  that the High Court was right in accepting http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that reasoning on the facts of this case when the finding is that the  accident had  occasioned while the road-roller was on the move and the negligence was on the part of the person who drove  the road-roller belonging to the respondents. The further fact to be noted here is that the appellant was just 18 years  old at  the time  of accident as found by the High Court and  he has to live with that throughout his life. The compensation awarded  by the  Tribunal itself  was not  much warranting a appeal to be preferred by the State. In the circumstances the judgment and order of the High Court is  set aside  and that  of the Tribunal in M.A.C. No. 129/89 dated  21.5.94 is restored. The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs.","The appellant while working as Beldar met with an accident while pouring water on the wheels of a road-roller moving on the road.

Though he  might have  been transferred on compassionate grounds, in view of the express indication in  the order  giving reasons  for the  transfer, i.e., need  of experienced  staff at  the respective places, the transfer  order cannot  be said to be arbitrary. Then it is contended that the petitioner being and officer belonging to the  Scheduled Castes,  is entitled  to be considered for retention of  his posting  nearest his home town. It is true that the instructions have been issued as reproduced at page No. 18  of the  paper book to that effect, yet they would be subject to  the administrative exigencies. IT is stated that the services  of the  experienced officer were necessary and so the  transfer order  came to  be made. It is true that as far as possible, the convenience of the officer belonging to Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes may be considered and he may  be posted  near the home town, but the authority has power to  transfer him  when the administrative need arises. It  is  further  contended  that  the  petitioner  had  made allegations against  the officers  and  the  transfer  is  a vindictive measure  of punishment.  It is  seen that  he was transferred on account of administrative exigencies. Under these  circumstances, we  do not think that there is any  justification to  interfere with the impugned order.

" JUDGMENT 2000 (3) SCR 911 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The short question that arises for consideration in this case is whether the Collector of a District has the power to suspend the Stipendiary Engineer appointed by the State Government and working in connection with the affairs of the community development. The respondent is a Stipendiary Engineer and at the relevant time was posted at Daspantapur Block in the District of Koraput, Orissa. It appears that since disciplinary proceedings were in contemplation against the respondent and, therefore, the Collector of Koraput by an order dated 8th April, 1996 suspended the respondent. The respondent challenged the aforesaid order of suspension before the Orissa Administrative Tribunal on the ground that the Collector had no authority to suspend him in contemplation of the departmen-tal inquiry against him. The tribunal, on filing of the original application, without issuing notice to the appellants, allowed the said application holding that the Collector had no power to suspend the respondent. It is against the said judgment the appellants are in appeal before us. Despite service of notice, the respondent has not put in appearance in this case. We, therefore, proceed to decide the matter in his absence. Rule 12 of the Orissa Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1962 provides that the appointing authority or any authority empowered by the Govemor may place a govemment servant under suspen-sion where a disciplinary proceeding against such a govemment servant is in contemplation or where a case against such a govemment servant in respect of any criminal offence is under investigation or trial. By an order dated 6.2.87, the Governor of Orissa in exercise of power under sub-rule (1) of Rule 12 of the Rules empowered the Collector of the district to suspend a govemment servant working in connection with the affairs of the Community Development. Subsequently, the-governor has also empowered the Collector of the district to inflict minor punishment on the govemment servants working with the affairs of the community development. The tribunal was of the view that since the Collector is empowered to impose only minor punishments; the power of suspension could not be delegated to the Collector, as power of suspension is exercisable only in the case of major punishment. This view, according to us, is not legally correct. It was not disputed before the tribunal that, under Rule 12, the Govemor is empowered to delegate the power of suspension on the Collector of the district. Merely because the Govemor Subsequently has empowered the Collector of the district to also inflict minor punishment, it does not mean that by such delegation the Govemor is denuded of his power to delegate power of suspension on the Collector. Such a view of the tribunal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 is neither borne out from reading of Rule 12 nor on the interpretation of the order dated 6th February, 1987. We are, therefore, of the view that once the Collector was empowered by the Governor to suspend a govemment servant working in connection with the affairs of the community development, the said power continued to be exercisable by the Collector even after delegation of power on the Collector to impose minor punishment. On the aforesaid view of the matter, the order under challenge is set aside. The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.","Stipendiary Engineer was posted at Daspantapur Block in the District of Koraput, Orissa.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 18083 of 1985. From  the  Judgment  and Order dated  12.9.1983  of  the Rajasthan High Court in D.B. (Civil) Spl. Appeal Nos. 35  of 1982, 76, 268 and 270 of 1983. S.K. Bagga for the Appellants. B.D. Sharma for the Respondents. The Order of the Court was delivered by 247 VENKATARAMIAH, CJ. In these appeals the appellants  have questioned  the validity of Section 15 (as amended)  of  the Rajasthan  Imposition  of Ceiling on  Agricultural  Holdings http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Act,  1973. It is not disputed that this Act was enacted  by the  Rajasthan Legislature for bringing about  Agrarian  Re- forms in the State of Rajasthan. The validity of some of the provisions of the Act came up for consideration before  this Court  in Bansidhar v. State of Rajasthan, [1989] 2 SCC  557 before  a  Constitution Bench of this Court and  this  Court made  declaration that the Rajasthan Imposition  of  Ceiling Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 was a legislation which  was made  for  the purpose of bringing out Agrarian  Reform.  In view  of the above finding, it is clear that the  provisions including s. 15 (as amended) contained therein are protected by  Article 31(A)(1)(a) of the Constitution  notwithstanding the fact that some of these provisions contravened  Articles 14 and 19. The  Grounds  urged in respect of the  appeal  are  that Section 15 (as amended) in question was violative of Article 14.  Since the provisions of the Act as already  stated  are protected  by Article 31(A)(1)(a), the attack does not  sur- vive.  The High Court was therefore right in  upholding  the validity  of Section 15 of the Act. Therefore, there  is  no ground  to  interfere with the Judgment of the  High  Court. These appeals fail and are dismissed. Interim orders  passed if any, in these cases stand vacated. T.N.A.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.   This  appeal by special leave arises from the  judgment of the High Court of Kerala in C.R.P. No.1916/84 dated Janu- ary  29,  1988.   The appellant has two  married  sons.   He executed  two gift deeds, Ex.R-1 and Ex.R-2  bequeathing  10 acres  and 11 acres respectively in favour of his sons.   He had  applied for exemption of those lands from  his  ceiling area  prescribed  under  the Kerala Land  Reforms  Act.   On remand by the High Court, the Land Tribunal gave the benefit of  six  acres to each of the sons.  For rest  of  the  land covered by the gift deeds, the revision petition was  filed. The High Court confirmed the order of the Land Tribunal  and dismissed the revision petition. 3.   Section 84(1A) reads thus: ""Section   84(IA):  Notwithstanding   anything contained  in sub-s.(1), or in  any  judgment, decree   or  order  of  any  court  or   other authority,  any voluntary transfer  effect  by means  of  a  gift deed  executed  during  the period  commencing on the 1st day of  January, 1970 and ending with the 5th day of  November, 1974  by  a person owning or holding  land  in excess  of the ceiling area in favour  of  his son or daughter or the son or daughter of  his predeceased  son or daughter shall be  not  to be, or ever to have been, invalid - (a)if the extent of the land comprised in  the gift   does  not  exceed  the   ceiling   area specified in clause (a) of sub-s.(1) of  s.82; and (b)if the extent of the land comprised in  the gift exceeds the ceiling area specified in the said  clause,  to the extent of  that  ceiling area."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 4.      Section 82(1)(a) reads thus: ""Section  82(1)(a):  In the case of  an  adult unmarried  person or a family consisting of  a sole surviving member, five standard acres, so however  that  the ceiling area shall  not  be less  than six and more than seven and a  half acres in extent."" 5.   A  conjoint reading of these provisions  would  clearly envisage that a gift 384 deed executed between the period commencing from January  1, 1970 and ending with November 5, 1974 by a person owning  or holding land in excess of the ceiling area in favour of  his son or daughter or son or daughter of the predeceased son or daughter  shall  not be deemed to be or ever  to  have  been invalid.   The  extent  of the land comprised  in  the  gift should  not exceed the ceiling area specified in clause  (a) of  s.82(1), which in the case of an adult unmarried  person or a family consisting of a sole surviving member, shall  be five standard acres, so however that the ceiling area  shall not be less than six and more than seven and a half acres in extent.   In  other words, if a gift deed is executed  by  a person  in favour of his son or daughter-etc.,  the  maximum land which s.82(1)(a) empowers the donor to gift, would  not be  less than six acres and not more than seven and  a  half acres  of  land  in extent.  The  Tribunal,  therefore,  had rightly  granted an extent of six acres of land to  each  of his married sons.  Therefore, we do not find any  illegality in the orders of the Tribunal and the High Court  warranting interference. 6.     The appeal is dismissed.

The Land Acquisition Officer awarded Rs.4,000/- and Rs.4,500/-  per acre  for Group  I and  Group II  of the lands. On  reference, the  Subordinate  Judge  enhanced  the compensation to  Rs.10,000/- and  Rs.11,500/- per  acre  for Group I and Group II respectively. On appeal, the High Court set aside  the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial Court for  reconsideration.  Thus  this  appeal  by  special leave. It is  seen that  all the lands were agricultural lands at the time of acquisition and their prevailing market value varies between  Rs.6,000/- to  Rs.6,500/-  per  acre.  Under these circumstances,  it would  be just  and proper  if  the compensation is  fixed at  Rs.6,000/- per  acre uniformly to all the lands. It is ordered accordingly. The appeal is allowed.

Civil Appeals Nos. 873 and 1425 are by  cer- tificate  under Article 133(1) of the Constitution of  India and Civil Appeal No. 1748 is by special leave. 605 (Ray, C.J.) These  appeals turn on the question whether the  Commis- sion  described as the Forward Market Commission  under  the Forward  Contract (Regulation) Act, 1952, can impose  condi- tions under section 14-A and Section 14-B on the commodities in  respect of which business can be carried on  by  persons who apply for registration. This  Court in Union of India &  Anr. v. M/s.   Rajdhani Grains and Jaggery Exchange Ltd. & Ors. (1975 Supp. S.C.R.1) dealt with this specific question and came to the conclusion that  the  specification of the commodities  in  respect  of which  the  business can be carried on is a  condition  con- cerned  with  the  regulation and control  of  the  business relating  to forward contracts.  It is idle to suggest  that the  Commission in granting certificate of  registration  to carry  on  business  will not be competent  to  specify  the commodities  in which  the  persons asking for  registration will deal. Another contention was raised before us that the  provi- sions contained in Section 4 of the Forward Contract  (Regu- lation)  Act-1952 do not confer power on the  Commission  to impose conditions.  This contention is also repelled by  the decision  of this Court to which reference has already  been made.   It  has been held in that case that  the  Commission alone is vested with power to impose conditions in regard to commodities  in  respect of which forward contracts  can  be entered into by a particular association.  Sections 15 to 18 of the Act do not clash with the power of the Commission  to impose  conditions in respect of commodities in which  busi- ness of forward contract  can  be carried on. Another  contention  was advanced before  us  that  with regard to the recognised associations the Commission had  no power  to  impose conditions with regard to  commodities  in which  they deal.  This contention is also answered  by  the decision  of  this Court (supra).   Further  the  provisions contained in Chapter III-A specifically deal with  registra- tion  of  all  associations concerned  with  regulation  and control   of forward contracts and the power of the  Commis- sion to grant or refuse such certificate of registration. All  contentions advanced by the appellants are  already answered’  by  the decision of this Court  (supra)  and  the observations  made herein.  The appeals are  therefore  dis- missed.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati. J. Leave granted. Heard learned  counsel for the parties. The appellant - Baij Nath  has been convicted under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149 IPC. It was alleged against him that he had provoked his co-accused to kill Devi Charan. After perusing  the evidence,  we  find  that  all  the witnesses had  made consistent  improvements  regarding  the role played by Baij Nath. In the FIR,  the only role alleged to have  been played  by him was that he had provided others to kill  Devi Charan.  Before the court, all these witnesses stated that  Baij Nath  had also given blows to Devi Charan. There was  no other evidence against him except the evidence of those  three witnesses  who, as  stated above,  had  made material improvement regarding the role played by Baij Nath. There was  no corroborative  evidence to show that Baij Nath was present  at the  time of  the incident. The courts below were therefore  in error in convicting the appellant for the offence punishable  under Section  304  Part  II  read  with Section 149 IPC. As we  are of the view that his presence at the time of the incident  has not  been satisfactorily  established,  he deserves to  be given benefit of doubt.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  Heard the  counsel  appearing  for  the parties. The appellant herein filed a complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate,  Mau alleging  commission  of  offences under sections  406, 409,  420 and 467 IPC by the respondent Nos.  1   to  4   (’respondents’  for  short).  The  learned Magistrate took  cognizance  upon  the  complaint  and  then recorded the  statement of  the appellant  under Section 200 Cr.P.C. On being satisfied from the complaint, the documents filed therewith  and the statement of the appellant that the above offences  were made  out against  the  respondents  he issued  process   against  them.   Aggrieved   thereby   the respondents filed  a petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. for quashing the  complaint and the proceeding arising therefrom which was  allowed by the High Court with a finding that the complaint was false, frivolous and vexatious and a direction upon the  appellant to  pay Rs.5,000/- to the respondents as costs. Hence this appeal. Having perused  the impugned  judgment in  the light of the complaint  and its  accompaniments we are constrained to say, that  the High  Court exceeded  its jurisdiction  under Section 482  Cr.P.C. in  passing the  impugned judgment  and order. It  is rather  unfortunate that though the High Court referred to  the decision in State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal (1992 Supp.  (1) SCC  335) wherein this Court has enumerated by way  of illustration  the categories  of cases  in  which power to quash complaint or FIR can be exercised, it did not keep in  mind - much less adhered to - the following note of caution given therein :- ""We also  give a  note of caution to the effect that  the  power  of  quashing  a criminal proceeding  should be exercised very sparingly  and with  circumspection and that  too  in  the  rarest  of  rare http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 cases;  that   the  Court  will  not  be justified in  embarking upon  an enquiry as to  the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR  or   the  complaint  and  that  the extraordinary or  inherent powers do not confer an  arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to  act according  to its  whim or caprice."" In the  complaint the  appellant averred  that he was a teacher of  Madrasa Faiz-e-Am since the year 1974 and at the material time  the respondents  were the Manager, Principal, Teacher and  Member of  the Managing Committee of the school respectively. In  the year  1985 he  went on  leave  to  get higher education  in Saudi Arabia and after coming back from there in  1988 when he went to join the School he found that his salaries  and dearness  allowances for  the above period had been  drawn by  them from  the Government  funds and, by forgoing his  signatures, purported  payments thereof to him were shown.  According to the complaint, the respondents had thereby committed  breach of  trust of  Government money. In support of  the above  allegations  made  in  the  complaint copies of the salary statements of the relevant periods were produced. Inspite  of the  fact that  the complaint  and the documents annexed  thereto clearly  made out a, prima facie, case for  cheating, breach  of trust  and forgery,  the High Court proceeded  to consider  the version of the respondents given out  in their petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. vis-a-vis  that  of  the  appellant  and  entered  into  the debatable area  of deciding which of the version was true, - a course  wholly impermissible  in view  of the above quoted observations in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra). For the  foregoing reason,  we allow  this appeal,  set aside the  impugned order  of the  High Court and direct the Magistrate to  proceed with the complaint in accordance with law.","High Court exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. in passing the impugned judgment and order.

" JUDGMENT 2000 (2) SCR 888 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The petitioner is a common carrier govered by the Carriers Act, 1865. It contends that under Section 14(l)(d) of the Consumers Protection Act, 1986 the Consumer Fora can direct payment of compensation to the consumer for loss or injury suffered by the consumer due to the ’negligence’ of the opposite party and hence the burden of proof is on the complainant. It is contended that Section 9 of the Carriers Act which ’imposes burden on the defendant or the common carrier to prove absence of negligence cannot therefore be applied so as to shift the onus to the carrier to prove absence of negligence. In view of the recent Judgment of this Court dated 28th March, 2000 in Patel Roadways Limited v. Birla Yamaha Limited, in C.A. No. 9071 of 1996, we are of the view that the liability of the common carriers is that of the insurer. It was held mere that Section 9 of the Carriers Act, 1865 applies to matters before the Consumer Fora under the Consumers Protection Act. It was also held that the principle underlying Section 9 of the said Act relating to burden of proof is a principle of common law and has been incorporated in Section 9 of the Carriers Act. Even assuming that Section 9 of the Carriers Act, 1865 does not apply to the cases before the Consumer fora under Consumers Protection Act, the principle of common law above mentioned gets attracted to all these cases coming up before the Consumer fora. Section 14(l)(d) of the Consumers Protection Act had to be understood in that light and the burden of proof gets shifted to the carriers by the application of the legal presumption under the common law. Section 14(l)(d) has to be under-stood in that manner. The complainant can discharge the initial onus, even if it is laid on him under Section 14(l)(d) of the Consumers Protection Act, by relying on Section 9 of the Carriers Act. It will therefore be for the carrier to prove absence of negligence. It has been held La like circumstances that a defendant in a suit on the basis of a negotiable instrument can discharge the onus lying on him under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act by relying on another presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act under which if a plaintiff does not produce the accounts in his personal custody an adverse inference can be drawn against the plaintiff. Kundanlal v. Custodian, Evacuee Property, AIR (1961) SC 1316. With the above observation and following the above said Judgment in the case of Patel Roadways, we dismiss the special leave petitions accord- ingly.","The petitioner is a common carrier govered by the Carriers Act, 1865.

" O R D E R The narrow  point before  the High Court as also before the Revenue Authorities was whether the appellant-tenant was in arrears  of rent beyond 3 years and could action be taken under  Sec.   25(1)  or   25(2)  of  the  Bombay  Tenancy  & Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 ? The distinction between the two provisions is apparent. Sec. 25(1)  enables a  Mamlatdar  to  grant  relief  against termination  of   tenancy  for   non-payment  of   rent   by facilitating payment of rent on call to the tenant to pay it directly to  the landlord  or in  court with  costs  of  the proceedings within  15 days  from the date of the order, and on failure  of which  to suffer  an ejectment.  In contrast, Sec. 25(2)  carves out an exception that if the tenant is in arrears on  his failure to pay rent for any three years, the landlord has  to give  an intimation  to that  effect to the tenant within a period of 3 months of each default, and then ejectment must  follow as  a consequence  and  the  remedial provision under  Sec. 25(1) cannot come to the rescue of the tenant. The  finding recorded  by the High Court is that the instant was  a case  covered under  Sec. 25(2)  and that the Mamlatdar could  not proceed under Sec. 25(1) permitting the tenant to  save the  tenancy on  payment of  arrears of rent within 15  days of  the order.  The  High  Court  has  given adequate  reasons   to  come   to  that   view.  We  see  no justification to alter the same. The appeal, therefore, fails and is hereby dismissed.

" O R D E R We have heard the counsel on both sides. Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and decree  of the  High Court of Madras in A.S. No. 212/83. It has  a chequered history. By order dated July 27, 1992 in C.A. No.  2718/92 this Court remitted the matter to the High Court to  consider whether there was any family arrangement. The High Court has held that there is no family arrangement. Therefore, the appellant is not entitled to the partition of the property  and allotment  of his  share in terms thereof. Thus this appeal by special leave . The only  question  raised  by  Mr.  S.Sivasubramaniam, learned senior  counsel for  the appellant is: whether among the members  of the  family, there was the arrangement under which the  appellant was  put in  possession of  the  entire property and he has been in possession right from 1977 under the family  arrangement? The case of the respondents is that the father had the property at a partition with his brothers and the  property,  therefore,  is  self-acquired  property. Equally the  case of  the 5th  respondent is that his mother also  conveyed  her  own  interest.  Therefore,  it  is  not partible. It  would be obvious that the respondents have had some arrangement; otherwise the appellant would not have had the possession of the property and management thereof. Under these circumstances,  we feel  that the interests of justice would be  met by  directing the appellant to retain l/3rd of the property  and surrender  the remaining 2/3rd property to the contesting respondents who are the subsequent purchasers from the  other family  members. The  appellant should  also return 1/3rd  consideration paid  by the  respondents to the other members  in the  respective sale  deeds. He is further directed to  demarcate and  deliver 2/3rd  property  in  two months from today. The appeal  is accordingly allowed and the appellant is directed  to   deliver  possession   of  property   to   the respondents without any further order of Court.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP(Civil) No. 2603/2002) K.G. BALAKRISHNAN, J. Leave granted. This appeal is preferred against the Judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka in Civil Revision Petition No. 4278/98.   An Order of the Education Tribunal was challenged before the learned Single Judge and the same was set aside and hence this appeal by way of special leave. The respondent was employed as a teacher in a school owned and managed by the appellant.  An order was passed against the respondent terminating his service w.e.f. 21.8.1981.  According to the appellant, the respondent was then working on probation, though the respondent alleged that his probation period was already over.  The appellant had also contended that the respondent teacher had offered his resignation voluntarily and his resignation was accepted.      The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the termination of the services of the respondent, without there being a valid inquiry was not proper and therefore, the termination of service of the respondent was set aside and he was ordered to be reinstated to the post of ’Teacher’ with full back wages from the date of his termination. The learned Single Judge before whom the matter came up for consideration held that once the Tribunal had come to a conclusion that no proper inquiry had been conducted in accordance with law, the matter should have been remitted back to an Inquiry Committee to decide the issue.  The learned Single Judge, therefore, framed certain issues and appointed a District Judge(Retd.) as Chairman of the Inquiry Committee.  One representative each from the appellant side and the respondent side were directed to be included in the Inquiry Committee and the Committee was directed to complete the inquiry within a period of six months. It was also directed that dismissal should be treated as suspension and suspension allowance shall be paid in accordance with law. The order of the learned Single Judge is challenged before us. We heard both sides.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not think that the learned Single judge erred in remitting the matter for further inquiry.  However, we feel that the appointment of the committee is not necessary for the purpose.  The District Judge (Retd.) appointed by the High Court can very well conduct the inquiry as Inquiry Officer. The appellant shall pay a sum at the rate of Rs. 500/- per sitting to the Inquiry Officer apart from other incidental expenses.  The Inquiry shall be completed http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 within a period of six months.   The Respondent shall be deemed to be under suspension pending such enquiry.

" JUDGMENT 2003 Supp. (1) SCR 580 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The Forest Department in the State of Kerala decided to auction the right to collect and remove the residual of the tree growth and fire wood in sub- coupe No. 9 in Coupe No. 3, Pathanamthitta Range by means of public auction and the auction was fixed on 8th February, 1979. On that day, the appellant offered a bid for a sum of Rs. 3,00,100. Before the bid was confirmed, it is alleged that a fire had broken out in the forest, with the result the residual tree growth and fire wood was destroyed. The appellant herein wrote .1 letter to the respondents demanding reduction in the money offered by him I Despite that letter, the Managing Director confirmed the bid of the appellant and called upon him to produce the stamp paper for executing the necessary agreement and further to deposit Rs. 3,00,100 over and above the deposit already made by the appellant. Since the appellant did not deposit the money as directed by the Managing Director, the respondent re- am tinned the remaining residual tree growth and fire wood for a sum of Rs. 2,00.400. Since there was a shortfall of Rs. 1,21,439 the Managing Director wrote to the appellant to deposit the said amount by way of damages. It is under such circumstances, the appellant filed a petition under Article l’2h of the Constitution before the Kerala High Court. The Kerala High Court in view of its Full Bench decision in the case of Abdul Rahiman v. Divisional Forest Officer, reported in (1988).’ k L.I. 290, dismissed the writ petition. It is against the said judgment of the High Court, the appellant is in appeal before us. Ms. Malini Poduval, learned counsel urged that the view taken by the High Court that the matter is covered by a Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court is erroneous. She urged that the said decision is distinguishable and has no bearing in the present case. We find substance in the argument. In the present case we find that there was only a bid for removal of residual tree growth and fire wood, a substantial part of which was destroyed in fire. It is under such circumstances, the appellant wrote to the Divisional Forest Officer for cancellation of his bid or reduction of the bid amount. In the case of Abdul Rahiman’s  ase (supra) the breach of contract stood admitted. In Abdul Rahiman (sup; a) the Full Bench referred to an earlier decision reported in 1980 K.L.T 850* and distinguished the same on the ground that what was sought to be recovered therein was not an amount due on account of or in respect of tirnber under any contract thereof and, thus, Section 79 could not be invoked The case of the appellant, however, appears to be squarely covered by the decision of the Kerala High Court reported in 1980 K..L.T. 850.* http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It is trite that the question as to whether there is a breach o’ terms of the notice inviting tender or not should be adjudicated by an authority declared to be competent therefor. In a case where there is a dispute as to whether a damage has occurred, a finding of fact in that behalf must be arrived at by the competent authority, whereafter the amount of damages should be quantified. Such quantification of damages must also be in consonance with the terms of the relevant rules. As indicated hereinbefore, the appellant herein sought reduction in money offered by him as a result of a subsequent event which was a ’vis-major’. No concluded contract, thus, could come into effect and under such circumstances, the question of realisation of shortfall in the form of damages does not arise. In that view of the matter, the appeal deserve to be allowed. We, therefore, allow the writ petition and set aside the judgment and order under challenge. The appeal is allowed.

Special Leave granted. This appeal  is directed  against the  judgment of  the Principal  Bench  of  the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal (hereinafter referred  to as  ’the Tribunal’) dated July 25, 1994 in  O.A. No. 774 of 1994.  The appellants were employed as guards in the Northern Railway and they retired as guards during  the  period  between  1980  and  1988.    They  felt aggrieved  by  the  notifications  dated  December  5,  1988 whereby Rule  2544 of the Indian Railways Establishment Code was amended  and for  the purpose  of calculation of average emoluments  the   maximum  limit   in  respect   of  Running Allowances was  reduced from 75% to 45% in respect of period from January  1, 1973  to March  31, 1979 and to 55% for the period from April 1, 1979 onwards. The validity of the retrospective amendments introduced by the  impugned notifications  dated December  5, 1988  had been considered  by the  Full Bench  of the  Tribunal in its judgment dated December 16, 1993 in O.A. No. 395-403 of 1993 and connected  matters and  the said notifications in so far as they  gave retrospective  effect to  the amendments  were held to  be invalid  as being violative a Articles 14 and 16 of the  Constitution.   Since the  appellants were adversely affected by the impugned amendments, they sought the benefit of the  Full Bench of the Tribunal by filing representations before the  Railway Administration.   Since  they failed  to obtain redress,  they filed the application (O.A. NO. 774 of 1994) seeking relief before the Tribunal in April 1994.  The http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 said application  of the  appellants was  dismissed  by  the Tribunal by  the impugned  judgment on  the  view  that  the application was  barred by limitation.  The Tribunal refused to condone the delay in the filing of the said applications. The correctness  of the  decision of  the Full Bench of the Tribunal  has been  affirmed by  this Court in Chairman, Railway Board  & Ors.  V. C.R.  Rangadhamaiah &  Ors., Civil Appeals Nos. 4174-4182 of 1995 and connected matters decided today. Having regarding  to the facts and circumstances of the case, we  are of  the view that this was a fit case in which the Tribunal should have condoned the delay in the filing of the application  and the  appellants should  have been given relief in the same terms as was granted by the Full Bench of the Tribunal.    The  appeal  is,  therefore,  allowed,  the impugned judgment of the Tribunal is set aside, the delay in filing of  O.A. No.  774 of  199 is  condoned and  the  said application is allowed.

Chatterjee for the Appellant. S. K.  Gambhir, R.  Nath and  Miss Ram Rakhiani for the Respondent. 197 The order of the Court was delivered by UNTWALIA, J.-The appellant was an office Superintendent in the  office of  Agriculture Department.  Certain  charges were levelled  against him.  An enquiry  was purported to be held. After  finding him  guilty of  some  charges,  he  was reverted to a lower rank. He challenged that order by filing a Writ Petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court . That Writ Petition was  allowed and the order of reversion was quashed on the  ground that  the enquiry  held was  not  proper  and legal. In view of the order of the High Court, the appellant was   reinstated    in   his   original   post   of   office Superintendent.  But   shortly  after,   he  was  put  under suspension and  fresh proceedings  were started on the basis of the  same old  charges. In the second proceedings, he has been found  guilty of  certain charges, the details of which are not  necessary to  be mentioned  in our judgment. He was again reverted  and it  was also directed in the order  that the allowance  paid to  him during  the period of suspension could remain  intact. The  appellant  filed  a  second  Writ Petition in  the High  Court to challenge the fresh order of reversion. The  High Court  has dismissed his Writ Petition. Hence this appeal in this Court on grant of a certificate by the High Court. Mr. D.  N. Mukherjee, learned counsel for the appellant urged only  two points before us; (1) that after the earlier order of  reversion was  quashed by the High Court and after the appellant  was reinstated, no second enquiry on the very same charges  could be held and no second order of reversion could be legally and validly ’, made; and (2) that appellant was  entitled   to  the   full  salary  for  the  period  of suspension. We find  no substance  in either of the points urged on behalf of  the appellant.  The earlier  order was quashed on the technical  ground. On  merits, a second enquiry could be held. It  was rightly  held. The order of reinstatement does not  bring   about  any  distinction  in  that  regard.  The Government had  to pass that order because the earlier order of reversion  had been  quashed by  the High  Court. Without reinstating the  appellant, it  would  have  been  difficult perhaps unlawful,  to start  a  fresh  enquiry  against  the appellant. The  observations  of  this  Court  in  the  last paragraph of  the judgment in State of Assam & Anr. v. J. N. Roy Biswas  are not  applicable to  the facts of the present case and do not help the appellant at all. The reduced amount paid to the appellant for the period of suspension  was affirmed by making it a part of the order of reversion 198 itself. That being so, the second point urged by the counsel is also,  of no substance. For the reasons, stated above, we dismiss this  appeal but  since the,  appellant has  already retired from service, we make no order as to costs. V.D.K.

Declaration  under Section 6 was published on August 25, 1987. After conducting of enquiry, the award came to be made on December 17, 1988. The symbolic possession was taken on  the said  date.

The  question is  whether the procedure followed by the Land Acquisition officer was vitiated by any error  manifest   on  the  face  of  the  record  warranting interference by  the High  Court? Shri  Naresh Kumar  Shrma, learned counsel  for  the  respondents,  contends  that  the respondent/tenant has  not been given any opportunity at the enquiry under  Section 5-A.  The land  is the only source of livelihood and  scheme was  temporary. In  view of  the long lapse of  time the  purpose of the acquisition under Section 4(1) of  the Act  no longer survived. Therefore, it does not serve and  purpose. Counter  affidavit filled  in  the  High Court by respondents shows that pursuant to the notice under Rule 30  of the  Land Acquisition Rules, the respondents had filed the objections and it is stated therein as under: ""The concerned  farmers were issued notices under Section 5-A under the Land Acquisition  Act and  Rule  30 giving 30  days  time  for  raising objection  on  2.9.1986,  concerned farmer  Shri   Mussa  alias  Swesha Nanda Objected  which was  taken on record."" Obviously, after consideration of all the objection and rejection  thereof,   declaration  under   Section   6   was published.  As  stated  earlier,  the  award  was  made  and symbolic possession  was taken  on December  17, 1988. Under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the circumstances,  the land  stood vested in the State free from all  encumbrances. After  the  proceedings  had  become final, the  writ petition   came to be filed on May 19,1989. The mere  fact that due to lapse of time no action was taken after the  filing of the writ petition, does not give ground for interference.  The further fact that public purpose must have been  served  by  constructing  the  quarters  for  the officers elsewhere,  is without any substance. The mere fact that on  account of  the pending litigation, no construction was made,  is no  ground  to  say  that  notification  under section 4(1)  was vitiated  by any  error of  law;  equally, increase in the prices of the lands is no ground.

These special leave petitions were placed for hearing before us and after hearing the parties we proposed to dispose of the matters at the admission stage itself.  We, therefore, reserved our order.  Later we were informed by counsel appearing on behalf of appellants in another appeal (Crl. A. No. 1113/2005 etc. etc.) that appeals involving the same issues had been directed to be heard by us.  We, therefore, did not deliver judgment and awaited hearing of the other appeals.  Ultimately those appeals were heard by us and we have referred the appeals to be heard by a larger bench by our order dated 22.2.2007. 3.      In appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 1568/2006 and 1570/2006, the questions involved inter alia relate to the effect of recommendation made by the Review Committee under the provisions of The Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 as amended by Ordinance of 2003.  Similar questions are also involved in  Crl. A. No. 1113/2005 and other connected matters, though that case relates to similar provisions in Prevention of Terrorism (Repeal) Act, 2004, which we have referred to a larger Bench.  We are, therefore, of the view that the appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 1568/2006 and 1570/2006 should also be considered by a larger Bench and,  if so, directed by the Hon’ble Chief Justice, may be heard along with Crl. A. No. 1113/2005 and other connected matters which are pending http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 hearing before a larger Bench. 4.      In criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 1357/2006 the appellants have impugned the order of the High Court dated 9.3.2006 dismissing their application for discharge under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  We notice that criminal appeals giving rise to SLP(Crl.) Nos. 1357/2006,  1568/2006 and 1570/2006 were heard together by the High Court but the appeal giving rise to SLP(Crl.) No. 1357/2006 was disposed of by a separate judgment.  If criminal appeals arising out of SLP(Crl.) 1568/2006 and 1570/2006 are ultimately decided in favour of the appellants, nothing may survive for consideration in the criminal appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.) 1357/2006.  However, if the appellants do not succeed in the aforesaid two appeals, the Court may consider the merit of criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.1357/2006. 5.      In these circumstances, we direct that criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 1357/2006 may also be heard by a larger bench alongwith appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) 1568/2006 and 1570/2006 or soon after the disposal of those two appeals, as the Hon’ble Chief Justice may direct. 6.      Accordingly, we direct that these matters be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice for appropriate directions.",Prahaladbhai Prabhudas Patel and others appealed against SLP(Crl.) No. 1357 of 2006.

Parasaran Attorney General and Ms. A. Subhashini  for the Petitioners. P.H.  Parekh, Suhail Dutt, P.D. Sharma and R.  Ramachan- dran for the Respondents. The following Order of the Court was delivered: In  these  petitions  for review  the  learned  Attorney General of India urges that certain observations and conclu- sions expressed in the individual Judgments of Bhagwati, CJI and  one of us (Ranganath Misra, J) appear to conflict  with each  other,  and prays that clarification be made.  In  the first place, he has drawn our attention to the  observations of  Bhagwati, CJI where the learned Chief Justice has  taken the view that one of the two alternative options was open to the Government while appointing the Chairman, a  Vice-Chair- man and administrative members of the Administrative  Tribu- nal. The learned Chief Justice said that the appointment  of Chairman,  Vice-Chairman and members of  the  Administrative Tribunal  should  be made by the concerned  government  only after  consultation  with the Chief Justice  of  India.  The alternative  suggestion  is that a  High  Powered  Selection Committee should be appointed headed by the Chief Justice of India  or a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court or  the  con- cerned  High Court to be nominated by the Chief  Justice  of India.  In his Judgment our brother Ranganath Misra, J.  has opted  for  the latter alternative.  Having  considered  the matter  carefully,  we are of opinion that in  the  case  of recruitment  to  the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal  the appropriate course would be to appoint a High Powered Selec- tion  Committee  headed by a sitting Judge  of  the  Supreme Court  to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India,  while in  the  case  of recruitment to  the  State  Administrative Tribunals,  the High Powered Selection Committee  should  be headed by a sitting Judge of the High Court 235 to  be  nominated  by the Chief Justice of  the  High  Court concerned. The second contention of the learned Attorney General is that the observations of Bhagwati, CJI that for the appoint- ment  to  the post of Vice-Chairman  of  the  Administrative Tribunal, besides a District Judge an Advocate who is quali- fied to be a Judge of the High Court should also be regarded as  eligible, calls for reconsideration because an  Advocate will  not  have the administrative experience which  is  re- quired  for a member of the Administrative Tribunal. We  are unable  to  accept the contention. In the  first  place,  an Advocate who is qualified to be a Judge of the High Court is an  Advocate who by implication is qualified to perform  not only  the judicial duties but the  administrative  functions which a High Court Judge is expected to discharge. Secondly, whether an Advocate applying for recruitment to the Adminis- trative Tribunal has sufficient administrative potential can be examined and judged during the process of selection.  We, therefore, do not propose to interfere with the observations made by Bhagwati, CJI in his Judgment. The  Learned Attorney General then prays that  the  time fixed  in the Judgment for setting up additional Benches  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 the  Administrative Tribunal should be extended to  December 31, 1987. Having regard to the circumstances of the case and the administrative requirements of the situation, we have no hesitation in granting the time prayed for. The learned Attorney General also prays that time may be extended  upto July 31, 1987 for introducing legislation  to give  effect to the observations made by the Court in  these cases. We grant time accordingly. The Review Petitions stand disposed of. P.S.S.                                             Petitions disposed of. 236","Review Petition Nos. 520.23of 1987.

" O R D E R Leave granted. On   26th December, 1990, the appellant was arrested by the SHO,  Police Station, Nanded, in connection with FIR No. 150.90. The charge-sheet was filed against the appellant and also other accused persons for an offence under Section 6 of the Terrorist  and  Disruptive Activities  (Prevention) Act, 1987 read  with Sections  286, 120B  and 34  of Indian Penal Code read with Section 9(B) of the Indian Explosives Act, on 19th December, 1991. The appellant is a priest. He is now in jail for  more than four years and eight months continuously except for  a short  period of  21/2 months  when he  was on parole  on  medical  grounds.  The  minimum  sentence  under Section 6 of the TADA Act is only five years. The appellant  applied for  grant of  bail some time in June,  1994.   Before  the   appellant  had   made   several applications for bail, which were all rejected. On 18th  January, 1995, the Designated Court once again rejected the  bail application  stating, inter alia, that no fresh ground  had come  into existence  for  granting  bail, since  June,   1994  when  the  last  bail  application  was rejected. We have  perused the  record of  the case heard counsel for both  the parties.  We are of the view that in the facts of this case, the appellant should be released on bail. The order  dated  18th  January,  1995  passed  by  the Designated Court for Rajasthan, Ajmer, is set aside. The appellant  herein, Giani  Pratap Singh, is directed to be  released on  bail on  executing a  bond for  a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees  fifty thousand  only) with two sureties of the  like amount  to the  satisfaction of  the Designated Court, Ajmer, Rajasthan. The undertrial  accused shall,  on  being  released  on bail, present  himself  at  the  police  station  which  has prosecuted him  at least  once in a week. He will also  make http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 himself available  for interrogation  and trial  as and when necessary. He  shall not  leave the  area falling within the jurisdiction  of  the  Designated  Court,  except  with  the permission  of  the  Judge  of  the  Designated  Court.  The Designated Court  will be  at liberty to cancel bail, if any of the  conditions  of  bail  are  violated  or  a  case  of cancellation of  bail is otherwise made out. It will also be open to the respondents to move for cancellation of the bail in case  the appellant refuses to co-operate in the trial or interrogation. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","Giani Pratap Singh was arrested by the SHO,  Police Station, Nanded, in connection with FIR No. 150.90.

Notice under Section 7(1) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") for acquisition of 8.13 acres of land belonging to respondent No. 1 was issued on 26.2.1975.  On 5.1.1977, Notification in Form ’J’ was published. On 28.10.1985, the competent authority recommended compensation. The claimant was not satisfied with the compensation awarded.  The matter was referred to the District Judge, who was appointed as the sole Arbitrator under the Act.  The Arbitrator passed award on 23.3.1989 wherein apart from enhancing the compensation, the Arbitrator gave 6% p.a. interest over the amount of enhanced compensation.  The Union of India as well as the claimant went in appeal before the High Court and the High Court   by  the  impugned  order  dated 25.4.2003 further enhanced the compensation.  Over and above the enhanced compensation, it  awarded solatium at the rate of 15%  and 6% interest. 4.           Aggrieved by the said  order, the Union of India is in appeal before us by way of special leave petition. 5.          It is contended by learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India that on the awarded amount there is no provision for grant of either solatium or the interest and, therefore, the High Court has committed an error in awarding the compensation under those heads. The position in law is conceded by learned counsel for Respondent No.1- claimant.  However, he has submitted that considering the fact that the competent authority was appointed in the year 1985, nearly after 8 years from the date of publication of the Notification in Form ’J’, the interest and solatium granted may not be directed to be refunded.  Both learned counsel have relied upon the decision in the case of Union Of India v. Hari Krishan Khosla, 1993 Supp (2) SCC 149, wherein a 3-Judge Bench of this Court while considering the provisions of Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952,  has  held  that the provisions for grant of solatium and interest on the amount of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, cannot be read into the provisions of the Act of 1952. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 5.            In view of the above pronouncement by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court, the High Court has committed an error in giving 15% solatium and 6% interest over the amount of compensation.  However, considering the fact that although the land had been acquired by issuance of declaration on 5.1.1977 but the authority having been appointed after 8 years for determining the compensation, we do not find it appropriate to set aside the order of the High Court so far as the grant of 6% interest over the enhanced amount is concerned.  In view of the settled legal position, we set aside the order of the High Court in respect of grant of  15% solatium. 6.

" J U D G M E N T Verma, CJI Leave granted  limited to the question indicated in our order dated 7.7.9 The grievance of the appellants is that our order dated 7.5.97 in  Sanjay Jain  Vs. Anil  Sabharwal & Ors. [ (SLP(C) .../97 ( CC.4325/97 ] has been misconstrued to mean that the legality of  allotment of plots made under the discretionary quota even prior to 31.10.89 has been directed by that order to be  reopened and  examined. It  is submitted  that such a misinterpretation results  from a misconstruction of certain words in that order, namely: ""We are constrained to observe that the    accountability     of    the authorities who are responsible for making these  arbitrary  allotments which have  been rightly  cancelled by  the  High  Court  needs  to  be examined after  their  identity  is fixed in an appropriate proceeding. In addition,  it is  also expedient that any  remaining  allotments  of the kind  which have been cancelled by the  High Court  should also  be treated also be treated alike. This exercise has  not bee  performed by the High  Court in the preset case. It is, therefore, expedient that as a follow  up action, the High Court should  proceed   to  complete  the exercise."" It is  sufficient for  us to  clarify that by the above order dated  7.5.97 this  Court upheld  cancellation of  the allotments  out   of  the  discretionary  quota  made  after 31.10.89  and   it  was  further  said  that  any  remaining allotments of  the same  kind should  be  treated  alike  to complete the  exercise. In  other  words,  our  order  dated 7.5.97 contained  the direction  to treat all allotments out of the  discretionary quota  made after 31.10.89 without any exception, in  order to  examine the  accountability of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 concerned authorities  as also  to avoid  any discrimination between allotters  subsequent to  31.10.89. That  order was, therefore, concerned  entirely with the allotment made after 31.10.89   and did  not refer to any allotment prior to that date. We  consider it  necessary to  say  so  to  avoid  any possible  misinterpretation  by  this  Court’s  order  dated 7.5.97. We  may,  however,  add  that  the  only  question  for examination  by   this  Court   in  Sanjay   Jain  vs.  Anil Sabharwal’s case being all the allotments made subsequent to 31.10.89,  our   order  is  also  not  to  be  construed  as inhibiting any  separate/independent action  in  respect  of allotments for  any other  period including  period prior to 31.10.89.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 913  OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(C)No.17187 of 2004] Leave granted. In this appeal, Section 4 Notification was issued on 14/08/2000 for acquiring the land for public purpose, namely to supply drinking water in  Canal Based Water Supply Scheme . Challenge of the acquisition before the High Court was dismissed by the High Court.   This C ourt at SLP stage issued notice on 03/09/2004 on a contention of the appellants that the Gram Pancha yat land itself is available to satisfy their requirement and yet the appellants’ land, who are agric ulturists have been acquired by depriving their livelihood.  A counter affidavit has been filed by the Stat e stating that the land of the appellants is suitable for the public purpose and for which  it is acquired after their subjective satisfaction of the acquiring authority, and since land has been acquired after t he  subjective satisfaction   of the authority,  this  Court should not -2- interfere.   We are of the view that  which land is suitable to be acquired is the authority to decide after subjective satisfaction and not for this Court to decide such issue.   There is no merit in this appeal.   It is accordingly dismissed.

" WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO.171 OF 1985 O R D E R The  notification   under  Section  4(1)  of  the  Land Acquisition Act,  1894 (for  short, ‘the Act’) was published on March 8, 1957 for planned development of Delhi. The lands acquired for  the development  are 8.40  acres out  of which the land  of appellants are small in extent. In Justice A.S. Bhandari vs.  Union of India, (LPA No.81 of 1979) decided on May 1, 1980, the Division Bench of the High Court determined the market-value at Rs.10 per square yard, i.e., Rs.10,000/- per bigha.  The appellant,  aggrieved by  that,  filed  this appeal. The  only question  is whether  it is  a fit case to enhance the  compensation to  Rs.12/- per square yard, i.e., Rs.12,000/- per  bigha as  claimed  by  the  appellant.  Sri Juneja,  learned   counsel  appearing   for  the   claimants contended that  the lands  in Justice  Bhandari’s  case  are brick-kiln  land   while  the   lands   of   appellant   are agricultural lands.  Therefore, the  appellants are entitled to higher  compensation. It  is further  contended that  the notification under  Section 4(1)  was quashed  in subsequent proceedings which was ultimately upheld on November 8, 1968. No further  notification under  Section 4(1)  was published. Had  it   been  so   published,  further   increase  of  the compensation at  Rs.12/- per  square yard  would be just and fair  compensation.   Having  given   consideration  to  the contention of  Shri Juneja,  we find  it difficult to accept the  same.   On  the   facts,  evidence  relied  in  Justice Bhandari’s case  is a sale deed of 560 square yards in which admittedly the  market-value was fixed at Rs.12/- per square yard. Since  it is  a small extent of land, which formed the basis of  the case  to determine compensation at Rs.10/- per square yard,  the same  price would  not commend  when large extent of  land is  offered for sale to a willing purchaser. Keeping that  yard-stick in  view, we think that it is not a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 fit case for further increase. The  appeals  are  accordingly  dismissed  but  without costs.","Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, ‘the Act’) was published on March 8, 1957 for planned development of Delhi.

" ORDER The appellants M/s A.K. Goel and another are connected  with a  well-known Hindi Magazine ’Sarita’ in the capacity  as  a reporter  and  publisher.   The  contempt  proceedings  were initiated  on  the ground that an article published  in  the said   magazine  in  respect  of  the  functioning  of   the administration  of  subordinate judiciary in  U.P.  However, during  the  said  proceedings the  appellants  tendered  an unconditional apology and the same was accepted by the  High Court.   However, the grievance is that the High  Court  has made  certain  observations which, if  taken  seriously,  no newspaper will be in a position hereafter even to make  fair criticism regarding the functioning of the administration of subordinate  judiciary.   We  have  carefully  perused   the relevant portion of the High Court judgment in this context. The  High Court, as a matter of fact, observed that   ""after reading the article we are of the considered view that while writing the article in an attempt to improve the  conditions of the litigants as well as the judicial officers Ajai Kumar Goel   lost  sight  of  the  article  creating  an   adverse impression"".   The High Court, however, having made such  an observation  accepted the unconditional apology.  We do  not think  that the observations made by the High Court  in  any manner  prevent  the media from writing any  article  making fair criticism without undermining the integrity and dignity of the judiciary and which are not detrimental to the  cause of judiciary as a whole.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dismissing the Criminal Revision petition filed by the appellant. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi had found the accused- appellant guilty of offences punishable under Section 7(1) read with Section 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (in short ’the Act’).  He had sentenced him to undergo imprisonment  for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- with default stipulations. An appeal was carried and the learned Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi, in Criminal Appeal No.61 of 1999, dismissed the same holding that the offence was made out. As noted above, a revision petition was filed before the High Court which was dismissed summarily. 2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: On 27.11.1984, the Food Inspector purchased a sample of Khoya from the appellant. The Public Analyst found that the milk fat of the finished product was 19.07% as against the minimum prescribed standard of 20%. The appellant exercised his right under Section 13(2) of the Act. The appellant faced trial.  As noted above, the Metropolitan Magistrate convicted the appellant    and sentenced him. The appeal filed before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi, was dismissed. A stand was taken before the learned Additional Sessions Judge that in view of several decisions of this Court, there should be commutation of sentence. The learned Additional Sessions Judge held that the commutation of sentence under Section 433 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Cr.P.C.) was a matter within the discretion of State Government. The appellant filed criminal revision which was dismissed, as noted above. 3.      Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court, by a non-reasoned order, dismissed the revision petition, though in similar cases it had passed orders following the decision of this Court in N. Sukumaran Nair v. Food Inspector, Mavehkara (1997 (9) SCC 101). Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the exercise of power under Section 433 Cr.P.C. is discretionary and no direction can be given to commute the sentence. 4. Learned counsel for the appellant made a plea for affording http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the benefit as given by this Court in N. Sukumaran Nair’s case (supra) and Santosh Kumar v. Municipal Corporation and Anr. (2000 (9) SCC 151).  The plea is made on the ground that the occurrence took place in 1984 and the margin of variation is very small. 5. It is pointed out that the appellant has already suffered custody for more than three months. We direct that a sum of Rs.7,500/-, as fine,  be deposited within a period of six weeks from today. The appellant shall move the appropriate Government for commutation of the custodial sentence. On the deposit of the above amount being made within the stipulated time and the appropriate application being made the State Government may consider whether commutation can be done in view of the peculiar facts of the case by passing an appropriate order under Clause (d) of Section 433 of the Cr.P.C. In the meantime, the appellant shall remain on bail. 6.      With this end result, the appeal stands disposed of.","The appellant was found guilty of offences punishable under Section 7(1) read with Section 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.

The trial court as well as the  High Court  have neither  disputed the paternity nor the maternity of the appellant. He has been denied his share in the  joint Hindu  family property  owned by his father on the  sole  ground  that  when  begotten  no  valid  marriage subsisted between  his parents.  The trial  court was in his favour though  in giving  him legitimacy, but the High Court branded the  appellant  as  an  illegitimate  child  of  his parents and,  hence, not  entitled to claim partition of the joint Hindu  family property.  The said property consists of about 21  acres of  agricultural land in which the appellant claims 1/7th share. Evidence Was  led by  the parties  on the issue whether Munisami Gounder  had validly  married Pappammal. It was not denied  by  either  side  that  beforehand  Pappammal  stood married to one Koola Gounder and after lining with him for a couple of  years, had  walked out  of his house to live with Munisami  Gounder   way-back  in  the  Year  1942/1943.  The evidence  of   P.W.  2  led  by  the  plaintiff  as  to  the performance of  the spoken of marriage by rites and rituals, or that  efforts were made to have the marriage of Pappammal with Koola  Gounder cancelled,  was  rejected  by  the  High Court. Be  that as  it may,  the  fact  found  remains  that Pappammal walked  out of  her husband’s  house  and  started living with Munisami Gounder in the year 1942/1943 and it is as a result of that union that the appellant was born. The High  Court in  illegitimising the appellant, seems to have overlooked the caste factor which would have a great bearing in  order to  establish the relationship between the parties. They  were ’Gounder’,  necessarily falling  in  the classification of  ‘Shudras’. Hindu  law  is  clear  on  the subject that If a Shudra woman is turned out of the house by her husband,  or she  willfully  abandons  him  and  is  not pursued to  be brought back as wife, a divorce in fact takes http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 place, sometimes  regulated by  custom, and then each spouse is entitled,  to re-arrange  his/her life  in marriage  with other marrying  partners. Walking  out of Pappammal from the house of  her first  husband Koola Gounder was irretrievable and irreversible, for it is in evidence that neither of them took interest in each other thereafter. The divorce was thus complete. Paternity of the appellant having not been denied, he was  treated as a son of his father. We would, therefore, think that  the trial  court was  right in  giving  him  the status as  a son of his father. In doing so, the trial court rightly took  in aid  the fact  that in  recognition of that status, the appellant was given his first cousin in marriage i.e.   Munisami’s   sister’s   daughter.   That   fact   was corroborative of  a valid  acknowledgement of  paternity and legitimacy. If  the people,  especially the  relatives,  had treated and acknowledged the appellant as the legitimate son of his  father by  forging a  bond of  matrimony of the sort aforementioned, it  is a  strong piece  of evidence  to hold that the appellant was a legitimate offspring of his father. The High  Court thus clearly fell in error in illegitimising him. We reverse that view. For the  foregoing reasons,  we allow  this appeal, set aside the  impugned order of the High Court and restore that of the trial court, but without any order as to costs.",M.

Applying Rule 28 of  the  Rajasthan Engineering  Subordinate  Service   (Public  Health  Branch) Rules,  1967  certain  persons,  who  were  earlier  Diploma holders  and  who  had subsequently obtained  Degrees,  were placed  above  the  Respondent  in a  seniority  list.   The Respondent  had  challenged his placement in this  seniority list   as   prepared  by   the  Public  Health   Engineering Department,  Government of Rajasthan.  The Respondent had in the petition inter alia challenged the vires of Rule 28. The  Learned  Single  Judge,  by  an  Order  dated  21st September,  1999, made the Petition absolute by holding that the  controversy was covered by a judgment of this Court  in the  case  of  Vijay Singh Deora and Others  vs.   State  of Rajasthan and Another reported in 1997 (3) S.C.C.  118.  The learned  single Judge did not at all consider the effect  or validity of Rule 28, which reads as follows : ""Rule 28 :  - Seniority - Seniority of persons appointed to  the  lowest post of the Service or lowest categories  of posts  in  each of the group/section of the service, as  the case   may  be,  shall  be   determined  from  the  date  of confirmation  of  such  persons  to the said  posts  but  in respect  of  persons appointed by promotion to other  higher posts  in the service or other higher categories of posts in each  of  the group/section in the service, as the case  may be,  shall  be  determined from the date  of  their  regular selection to such posts."" In  Deora’s  case (supra) the applicability,  effect  or validity of Rule 28 had not been dealt with at all.  In that case  seniority  was not fixed on basis of this  Rule.   The questions  raised  in this Writ Petition were therefore  not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 covered  by  that  decision.   The aspects  raised  in  this Petition should have been considered on merits.  The Learned Single  judge  did  not consider  them.

Accordingly we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter back to the  Division  Bench for consideration of the Appeal on  its merits.

Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short,  the ’Act’)  was Published  on   July 7,1977, acquiring  14 acres  32 guntas  of land of Bachiragh village near  Suryapet  Nalgonda  District  (A.P.)  for  the purpose of  constructing a  Bus stand  Complex.    The  Land Acquisition Officer  awarded compensation  @ Rs. 7,500\- per acre. The  sub-Court on  reference awarded  the considerated compensation @ Rs. 3.60 lacs per acre.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Crl.  Misc.  Petition  No. 1424-1425 of 1977. (Application for release on Bail). S.   M. Jain, for the appellant. D.   Mukherjee, V. S. Dave, R. C. Tyagi and S. S.  Khanduja, for the respondent. I. Makwana, for the intervener. The Order of the Court, was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.  The petitioner  moves  for  bail  having surrendered after leave was granted to the State to file  an appeal against acquittal by the High Court. 536 The basic rule may perhaps be tersely put as bail, not jail, except  where there are circumstances suggestive of  fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or  creating other  troubles  in  the  shape  of  repeating  offences  or intimidating  witnesses and the like, by the petitioner  who seeks enlargement on bail from the court.  We do. not intend to be exhaustive but only illustrative. It  is  true  that the gravity of the  offence  involved  is likely  to  induce  the petitioner to avoid  the  course  of justice and must weigh with us when considering the question of  jail.  So also the heinousness of the crime.   Even  so, the  record  of the petitioner in this case is  that,  while lie,  has been on bail throughout in the trial court and  he was released after the judgment of the High Court, there  is nothing  to suggest that he, has abused the trust placed  in him  by the court; his social circumstances also are not  so unfavourable in the sense of his being a desparate character or  unsocial element who is likely to betray the  confidence that the court may place in him to turn up to take  justice, at  the hands of the court.  He is stated to be a young  man of  27 years with a family to maintain.   The  circumstances and the social milieu do not militate against the petitioner being  granted  bail at this stage.  At the  same  time  any possibility of the abscondence or evasion or other abuse can be  taken  care of by a direction that the  petitioner  will report himself before the notice station at Baren once every fortnight. This  petitioner  will be released on bail on  his  entering into a bond of his own and one surety for Rs. 5,000/- to the satisfaction  of the Additional District &  Sessions  Judge, Baren.  While the system- of pecuniary bail has a  tradition behind it, the time has come for rethinking on the  subject. It  may well be that in most cases not  monetary  suretyship but  undertaking by relations of the petitioner  or  organi- sation  to which he belongs may be better and more  socially relevant.   Even so, in this case we stick to  the  practice and direct the furnishing of one surety for Rs. 5,000/-. Application for intervention allowed. S.R.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 2376-2377  OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 26491-26492/04) Leave granted. The appellant  was appointed as Chowkidar on 1st August,1965, in Sarvodaya Shiksha Sadan Inter College, Bheerpur, Allahabad.  The appellant has questioned the Judgment and Order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 19th August,2004, whereby the Judgment and order of the learned Single Judge was modified to the extent that the relief which had been granted to the appellant by the learned Single Judge was curtailed and he was made entitled to his monetary benefits on retirement till 30th June,1985, and not till 31st January, 1993, as had been granted by the learned Single Judge. The controversy before the  learned Single Judge was  with regard to the correction made by the Principal -2- of the College of the appellant’s date of birth  in  his service records.  At the time of initial entry into service, the appellant’s date of birth was recorded as 1st January,1933, but subsequently it came to light that the appellant had studied in  Primary School, Khain, Karchana, Allahabad. In the school records his date of birth was shown as 12th June,1925.  On the basis of the above, the Principal of the college issued a notice to the appellant to show cause as to why his date of birth should not be corrected in the college records in view of the School Certificate.  A letter was also sent to the appellant to file a medical certificate of the Chief Medical Officer, Allahabad, regarding his age.  Thereafter, after giving the appellant a hearing, the Principal of the College corrected the date of birth of the appellant in his service records from 1st June,1933 to 12.6.1925 and  issued a letter to him on 20th August,1987. retiring him from service. The said order was challenged in appeal before the Committee of Management of  the institution which dismissed the same. As has been recorded by the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned Judgment, no further steps were taken by the appellant to challenge the said correction made by the  Principal of the College before the  District Inspector of Schools or before any  court -3- or authority.  Consequently, the said correction  became final and binding on the appellant. Thereafter, by an order dated 9.4.1986, the Joint Director of Education, Allahabad, fixed the appellant’s pension treating the date of retirement as 30.6.1985. The appellant challenged  the  above Order before  the learned Single Judge of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the High Court in writ jurisdiction.  The learned Single Judge   ultimately held that the correction had been illegally effected and should not be given effect to, and  directed that the appellant was to be treated in service upto 31.1.1993. The Division Bench  has set aside the said finding on the ground that the learned Single Judge could not have reopened the matter which had been finally decided and against which no further steps had been taken by the appellant. The reasoning of the Division Bench Judge appears to be sound. Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, we are unable to differ with the judgment impugned in this appeal and we accordingly,  dismiss the Appeal.  But there will be no order as to costs. The Authorities are  directed to disburse to the appellant  all  the  dues  in terms of the Order of the -4- Division Bench of the High Court, if not already disbursed, within two months from the date of communication of this Order.","The appellant was appointed as Chowkidar on 1st August, 1965, in Sarvodaya Shiksha Sadan Inter College, Bheerpur, Allahabad.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated April  5, 1990  of the  Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High  Court made  in LPA  NO.444/90. The land of the respondents, along  with  others,  admeasuring  50.55  acres situated   in    village   Behar   Tehsil,   Pathankot   was requisitioned and subsequently acquired for defence purposes under the  Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952  [for short,  the  ’Act’].  The  Land  Acquisition Officer had  determined the  compensation  at  Rs.201/-  per canal. When an application was made by the respondents under Section 8  of the  Act, the  arbitrator in  his award  dated December 6,  1986 determined  the compensation at Rs.1,000/- per canal.  He also awarded solatium @ 30% and interest @ 9% per annum  for one  year from  the date of taking possession and @  15% thereafter till date of deposit. When challenged, the appeal  came to be dismissed by the learned single Judge and affirmed  by the  Division Bench.  Thus this  appeal  by special leave. The only  question that  arises for  consideration  is: whether the  respondents are  entitled  to  the  payment  of solatium and interest awarded by the arbitrator ? This Court in Union  of India  v. Hari  Kishan Khosla [1993 Supp. 2 SCC 149] held  that  the  claimants  are  not  entitled  to  the solatium interest  since the  Act does  not provide  for the payment thereof.  On the  list occasion  when the matter had come up for hearing, this Court passed an order on March 25, 1996 directing  the appellants  to produce  the record of K- Form. A  letter dated  December 19 has been placed before us by the  learned counsel  for the appellants stating that the respondents have  not received  the amount under protest nor have they made any application for appointment of arbitrator within the  stipulated period.  We  need  not  go  into  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 question as  regards the  appointment of  the arbitrator for determination of  the compensation  against the award of the Land Acquisition  Officer since that order has become final. The only  question is:  whether the respondents are entitled to solatium and interest? Learned counsel  for the  respondents sought to contend that  the   Act   provides   for   determination   of   just compensation. All  the three  components form  part  of  the determination of  just compensation and that, therefore, the award  passed   by   the   arbitrator   does   not   warrant interference.  We   find  no   force  in   the   contention. Determination of  just compensation is with reference to the value of  the land acquired under the Act. Since the payment of solatium  and interest is in addition to the compensation determined under the Act, this Court in Hari Kishan Khosla’s case [supra]  had held  that the  arbitrator  is  devoid  of jurisdiction to  award solatium  and interest.  Under  these circumstances, the  High Court  was not  right in  upholding payment of solatium and interest. The appeal  is allowed  to the  extent of  awarding  of solatium and  interest and  with respect to determination of compensation @  Rs.1,000/- per  canal the  order of the High Court stands upheld.

" RAJENDRA BABU, J. : L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J An  agreement  to sell was entered into on  6.5.1994  by respondent  NO.3 with respondent Nos.  1 and 2 in respect of property  bearing  municipal No.C-590, Defence  Colony,  New Delhi  for  a  total sale consideration of Rs.80  lacs.   An application  in Form 37(I) was filed before the  Appropriate Authority  as required under Section 269UC of the Income Tax Act,  1961  [hereinafter  referred to as  the  Act].   The Appropriate  Authority  by an order made on 30.1.1984  under Section 269UD ordered the purchase by the Central Government of the said property for the sale consideration mentioned in the agreement to sell.  This order was challenged before the High  Court in C.W.P.No.3884 of 1994.  The High Court by  an order  made  on 17.10.1997 quashed the order for  compulsory sale  made  in  favour of the Union of  India.   Hence  this appeal by special leave. According  to the Appropriate Authority, the fair market value is assessed to be Rs.96,85,650/-, thus resulting in an increase  by  20 per cent of the apparent  consideration  of Rs.80  lacs  plus conversion charges of  Rs.1,04,000/-.   In reaching this conclusion, the Appropriate Authority took two instances  of  sale of properties situate at  C-77,  Defence Colony,  New  Delhi and C-86, Defence Colony, New  Delhi  to show that the value has been understated by more than 15 per cent.   Even  assuming  for the sake of  argument  that  the valuation  assigned  by  the Appropriate  Authority  to  the property  in  question is correct, one important factor  has been  ignored by the Appropriate Authority, namely, that the property  was  under litigation and proceedings  were  still pending  in  the court of law at the time when the sale  was sought  to be made and the Additional District Judge in fact had  issued  an injunction on May 27, 1994  restraining  the same,  transfer  or  parting  with  the  possession  of  the property.   The  Department  brushed  aside  this  important factor  as  regards  pending   litigation,  which  had  been initiated by the step brother of the transferor in which the title  of  the  transferor had been  challenged.   In  those circumstances,  the  High  Court  felt  that  the  impending http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 litigation  altogether  cannot be ignored while  determining the  fair market value on the ground that the transferor had agreed  to indemnify the transferee or that in the long  run the  litigation  will  fail.   Whatever  may  be  the  other argument  that had been addressed by the parties  concerned, it  is clear that the pending litigation assumed  sufficient importance  in the matter.  The High Court took note of  the fact  that in other cases where there is pending  litigation in  respect  of  properties  which have  been  subjected  to proceedings  under  Chapter  XX-C  of   the  Act  had   been discounted by 10 per cent.  It is not necessary to determine this  particular  percentage.  The well known  principle  of administrative law that if a relevant factor is ignored, the order made becomes vitiated has to be applied in the present case  as  well.   On  that  basis, the  order  made  by  the Appropriate  Authority is vitiated and on this short  ground we find that the view taken by the High Court is correct and calls for no interference.

Respondent No. 1, elder brother of the petitioner filed the suit  for declaration  against the  petitioner and three brothers that the decree dated May 4, 1990 was null and void which was  decreed by  the Subordinate  Judge, Hoshiarpur on September 29,  1993. The  petitioner has  filed an appeal in the Court  of the Additional District Judge, Hoshiarpur. The counsel made  a statement  on September  15, 1995  that  the petitioner did not intend to proceed with the appeal. On the basis thereof,  the appeal  was dismissed  as withdrawn. The petitioner challenged  the order  of the  appellate Court in the revision.  The High  Court confirmed  the  same  in  the impugned order. Thus, this special leave petition. The learned  counsel for  the petitioner  has contended that the  petitioner  had  not  authorised  the  counsel  to withdraw the  appeal. The  Court after  admitting the appeal has no  power to  dismiss the  same as  withdrawn except  to decide the  matter on merits considering the legality of the reasoning of  the trial  Court and  the  conclusions  either agreeing or  disagreeing with  it. We  find no  force in the contention. Order  III, Rule  4, CPC empowers the counsel to continue on  record until  the proceedings  in the  suit are duly terminated. The counsel, therefore, has power to make a statement on  instructions from  the party  to withdraw  the appeal. The  question then is: whether the court is required to pass  a reasoned  order  on  merits  against  the  decree appealed from  the decision  of the Court of the Subordinate Judge? Order  XXIII, Rule  1(1) and  (4) give  power to  the party to  abandon the  claim filed  in the suit wholly or in part. By  operation of Section 107(2) of the CPC, it equally applies to  the appeal  and  the  appellate  Court  has  co- extensive power  to permit  the appellant  to  give  up  his appeal against  the respondent  either as a whole or part of the relief. As a consequence, though the appeal was admitted under Order  XXXXI, Rule  9, necessarily  the Court  has the power to  dismiss the appeal as withdrawn without going into the merits  of the  matter and  deciding it  under  Rule  11 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 thereof. Accordingly, we  hold that  the  action  taken  by  the counsel is consistent with the power he had under Order III, Rule 4,  CPC, If  really the  counsel has  not acted  in the interest of  the party  or against  the instructions  of the party, the  necessary remedy  is elsewhere and the procedure adopted by the Court below is consistent with the provisions of CPC. We do not find any illegality in the order passed by the Additional District Judge as confirmed by the High Court in the revision. JThe special leave petition is accordingly dismissed giving liberty to the petitioner to proceed in according with law.","Petitioner had filed an appeal in the Court of the Additional District Judge, Hoshiarpur.

" O R D E R These appeals  by special leave arise from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the High Court of Allahabad, made on 30.10.1977 in special Appeal Nos. 1047 & 1048 of 1970. It is  not necessary  to  dilate  upon  the  three-tier history of the litigation. Suffice it to state that pursuant to the  remand order  made by  the High  court in  the  last instance, the  Deputy Director  has gone  into the  question whether the  settlement officer  under the consolidation Act has jurisdiction  to decide the dispute. Section 3(5) of the U.P. consolidation  of Holdings  Act defines  ""land"" to mean the land  held or  occupied for  the purpose  connected with agriculture, horticulture  and poultry  form  and  also  the site, being  part of  a holding, of a house of other similar structures. In view  of the  above definition under section 3(5) of the consolidation  Act, the buildings occupying the land and used for  commercial purpose  are not  covered by  the  Act. Therefore, the  High Court  had left  the dispute open for a decision by the appropriate Court. It is  an admitted position that the appellants and the respondents are holding heats in those areas. Under the U.P. Land Reforms  Act, 1950 the question whether such lands vest in the  state on  abolition of  the estates  etc. is  also a matter left  open since  the state  is not  a party to these proceedings.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R NON-REPORTABLE 1.      This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 5th of February, 2001 passed by a learned judge of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in RSA No.112 of 1996 whereby the High Court had allowed a second appeal filed by the respondent No.1 and set aside the judgments and decrees of dismissal dated 29th of January, 1996     and 20th of July, 1996 passed by the Civil Judge, Delhi and the Senior Civil Judge, Delhi, being the first appellate court, respectively. 2.      The plaintiff/respondent no. 1 had instituted the suit before the Civil Judge, Delhi for declaration and injunction in respect of the suit property and for other incidental reliefs. In the said suit, a preliminary issue was framed to the extent that in view of Section 185 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 (in short \021the Act\022), the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to entertain the suit was barred. Both the courts below held that the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit in view of the bar imposed under Section 185 of the Act. The High Court, in second appeal against the judgments of the courts below, held that in view of the nature of the reliefs claimed in the suit, the jurisdiction of the civil court was not hit by section 185 of the Act. Accordingly, the judgments of the two courts below were upset by the High Court by the impugned judgment and the trial court was directed to decide the suit on all other issues on merits. Feeling aggrieved, the instant special leave petition has been filed, in respect of which leave has already been granted. 3.      We have heard Mr. Gupta, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and Mr. Namboodiri, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents. We have examined the impugned judgment of the High Court as well as of the courts below. The High Court in the impugned judgment held that Section 185 of the Act could not be applied in view of the nature of the reliefs claimed in the suit and therefore, the suit shall be heard on merits on the other issues. In view of the stand taken by us, as noted hereinafter, and considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the allegations made in the plaint, we are, prima facie, satisfied that this appeal can be disposed of by directing the trial court to decide the suit not only on the other issues on merits but also on the issue regarding the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the suit in view of section 185 of the Act. 4.      Such being the stand taken by us at this stage, we are not going into the merits of the judgment of the High court as well as of the courts below. The trial court shall now http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 commence the trial of the suit and decide the same on merits on all issues, including the issue whether the civil court has the jurisdiction to try the said suit in view of the bar of Section 185 of the Act. While deciding the suit, the trial court shall not be influenced by any of the observations made by us or in the impugned judgment by the High Court or by the courts below.

" O R D E R. JAGANNADA RAO.J. The appellant  contends that  the notice  dated 23.1.89 for compulsory  retirement issued  under Rule 10(4)(a)(i) of the Maharastra Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1982 is bad as much as  the procedure  indicated in the  Circular issued by the State  Government on  1.9.1983  has  not  been  followed before the  appellant crossed 50 years and his case  must be deemed to  have reviewed  in his  favour before  crossed  50 years. In such a situation, a second review after he crossed 50 years is, according to the appellant, not permissible. It is  also contented  that it is not open to the respondent while  issuing  notice  on  23.1.1989  to  apply  the  norms prescribed in  a latter  Circular  dated  12.5.1986.  It  is contended that  while the  23.1.1983 Circular   prescribed a standard  of  not  less  than  average  the  Circular  dated 12.5.1986 prescribed  a more stringent standard of ’not less than  good’.  If  review  had  been  undertaken  before  the appellant  crossed   50  years,  than  it  would  have  been satisfied the  standard of  ’less than  average’ - which, in fact, he  did -  as per the norms prescribed by the circular dated 1.9.1983.  The contention of the appellant is that the circular dated  1.9.1983 is binding on the Government and is intended  to   see  that   the  general   power  under  Rule 10(4)(a)(i) is not used arbitrarily. After hearing  learned senior council on both sides, we were prima  facie inclined to accept the above contention of the appellant.  But we have come to notice a two Judge Bench decision in  Suryakant Govind  Oke vs.  State of Maharashtra [1995 Suppl.  (2) SCC  420] wherein it has held that even if an officer’s case has not been reviewed before he crossed 50 years, his  case can  be reviewed  under the  circular dated 12.5.1986 read  with Rule  10(4)(a)(i) of the Rule, and that this could  be done  even after he has crossed 50 years.  We have, therefore,  thought it  fit that  the case  is  to  be decided by a three Judge Bench. In this  context, we are of the view that the decisions in Union  of India & others vs. Narsirmiya Ahmadmiya Chauhan [1994 Suppl.  (2)  SCC  537],  K.  Chelliah  vs.  Industrial Finance Corporation  of India & Another [1992 Suppl. (3) SCC http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 82] and in Brij Mohan Singh Chopra vs. State of Punjab [1987 (2) SCC  188] decided  by Benches  of two  Judges and also a decision of  a three  Judges Bench  in  State  of  U.P.  vs. Chandra Mohan  Nigam [1978 (1) SCR 521] - all concerning the effect  of   Circulars/guidelines  dealing  with  compulsory retirement - are also relevant.

" J  U  D  G  M  E  N  T (arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 11462/2002) RAJENDRA BABU,  CJI : Leave granted. A writ petition was filed in the High Court by a resident within the vicinity of a unit of the appellant on the allegation that the appellant was letting out its trade effluents outside factory premises.  On 16.12.1996 the High Court appointed a Committee to make a report regarding discharge of effluent.  On the filing of Report by that Committee a show cause notice was issued to the appellant on 26.12.1996 in the light of the contents thereof. Thereafter,  the High Court on 9.1.1997 directed the closure of the factory.  In the course of the order made by the High Court it was noticed that the appellant could not say that there was no discharge of trade effluent.  The High Court directed the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 75,000/- and also ordered its closure.  On 16.1.1997 by another order made the High Court directed the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 75 lakhs as a condition for restarting of the unit .  On depositing such amounts in instalments the High Court directed restarting of certain activities which do not generate any kind of effluent.  Then by an order made on 27.1.1998 the High Court disposed of the matter.  In the course of the order made on that day it was noticed that an agreement had been entered into between the petitioner and certain other persons residing in the village with the appellant;  that effluent treatment plant (ETP) was about to be commissioned and this would include training of the people of the industry for the operation and of the maintenance of the ETP;  that the report filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board on examining the samples collected on 20.01.1999 indicated that the appellant is meeting the norms; that the petitioners and others in the writ petition filed before the High Court had been paid damages arising on account of discharge of effluents and had entered into an agreement which was filed before the High Court;  and that the unit having met with the requirements of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board.  On that basis, the High Court disposed of the writ petition allowing the same to be withdrawn. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 However, as regards the refund of the amount deposited by the appellant before the Court, the High Court stated that this aspect could be considered at a later stage. Thereafter,  an application was made for refund of the said amount in deposit.  The High Court disposed of that application without making any order by making it clear that such application could be revived after the cases pending before this Court are disposed of. In this appeal, it is urged before us that the writ petition having been withdrawn and the concerned persons who had suffered damage on account of discharge of effluents having been compensated, question of continuing to keep the said amounts deposited in Court would not arise. It is further submitted that this case stands entirely on different footing from other cases pending before this Court because in other cases discharge of effluent was to a common ETP while no such discharge had been made in this case, except some of the effluents having been discharged into lands surrounding the factory. Degradation of environment or damage, if any, suffered by the residents residing in the vicinity having been satisfied with the compensation paid to them in terms of the agreement which was produced before the High Court, the ETP having been set up and with pollution control norms having been satisfied,  the High Court ought to have considered question of refund of the amounts deposited with Court and should have treated this case on a different footing altogether and not connected with other cases pending before this Court. Therefore,  we set aside the order made by the High Court, remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration of the application for refund and to dispose of the matter in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed accordingly.","A writ petition was filed in the High Court by a resident within the vicinity of a unit of the appellant on the allegation that the appellant was letting out its trade effluents outside factory premises.

" JUDGMENT NON-REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL Nos.4384-4385 OF 2002 T. Krishna Reddy & Ors.                     ......Appellants Vs. M. Bagi Reddy & Anr.                      .......Respondents JUDGMENT HARJIT SINGH BEDI,J. 1.   These appeals arise out of the following facts. 2.   The appellant and his predecessors-in-interest were cultivating the suit land to the extent of about 9.2 acres falling under survey No. 357 of Alwal village, Malkajgiri Mandal, Ranga Reddy District in Andhra Pradesh and an ownership certificate under section 38E of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 had also been issued in their favour. In http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 5 2 1988, the appellants, pursuant to a family partition whereby they had been put in exclusive possession of the suit land, filed an application before the Divisional Revenue Officer for the issuance of a revised ownership certificate under Section 38E and after due enquiry a revised ownership certificate was, in fact, issued.   The respondents herein challenged the issuance of the aforesaid revised certificate before the Joint Collector, who dismissed the appeal by his order dated 19th June 1995 and a petition against this said order was dismissed by the High Court and the second appeal filed by the respondents against the order of the Joint Collector was also dismissed on 6th April 2000.       The respondents, who are in possession of the adjoining lands being survey Nos.355 and 405, filed a civil suit on 8th April 1996 before the Subordinate Judge Court, Ranga Reddy District seeking permanent injunction against the appellants with respect to the suit land i.e. the land in Survey No.357. The trial court decreed the suit in favour of the respondents herein.   Aggrieved by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 5 3 the order of the trial court, the present appellants filed an appeal and the appellate court re-appreciated the evidence and keeping in view the fact that a certificate under section 38E had been issued to the appellants which showed that they were in possession of the land, allowed the appeal. The respondents herein carried the matter in second appeal to the High Court and also filed a petition against the order dated 19th June 1995 passed by the Joint Collector confirming the validity of the certificate granted under section 38E.   The High Court dismissed the petition challenging the order dated 19th June 1995 but without framing any substantial question of law, allowed the second appeal filed against the order of the Civil Court.   It is in this circumstance that the present matter is before us. 3.   During the course of hearing, it has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants          that writ proceedings under the Inams Abolition Act are pending in the High Court and as the outcome of the aforesaid proceedings would have an important bearing on the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 5 4 present matter as well, it would, perhaps, be prudent to remit this matter to the High Court to be heard along with the writ petition. It has been pointed out that in the last paragraph of the impugned judgment of the High Court, the relevance of the Inam proceedings then pending     before   the   competent   authority       has     been recognized by the High Court, and an observation made that they would determine the fate of the dispute.

" JUDGMENT G.P. MATHUR,J. These petitions by special leave have been preferred against the judgment and order dated 22.4.2002 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. 2.      The petitioners are carrying on business of selling fruits and vegetables on their ’rehries’ (hand carts) in the grain market in Sector 26 in the city of Chandigarh.   It appears that steps were taken to remove them from the grain market.   At that stage they filed the writ petitions praying that a writ of mandamus be issued restraining the respondents from removing them from grain market in Sector 26 without allotting them alternative sites.   A further prayer was made that the respondents be directed to allot the petitioners alternative sites from where they may carry on their business.   Initially, an interim order was passed by a learned Single Judge in favour of the petitioners, but ultimately the writ petitions were dismissed by a Division Bench relying upon two earlier decisions rendered in similar writ petitions. 3.      In exercise of powers conferred by Sections 188 and 199 of Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, the Chandigarh Administration has framed Bye-laws known as Chandigarh Hand Cart (Control & Regulation) Bye-laws, 1976. Bye-law No.8 provides that no person shall use a handcart contrary to the Bye-laws.   It is an admitted position that the petitioners have not been granted any licence and, therefore, they do not have any legal right to carry on business in the grain market in Sector 26.   Having regard to the aforesaid legal position and the decisions rendered in the earlier writ petitions, the Division Bench was of the opinion that no writ of mandamus, as prayed for by the petitioners, can be issued in their favour. 4.      We have heard one of the petitioners in person and have given our careful consideration to the material on record.   This being the admitted position that the petitioners do not have a licence in their favour, we think, the High Court committed no error in declining to issue a writ of mandamus, as prayed for by the writ petitioners.   However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the special leave petitions are disposed of with a direction to Chandigarh Administration to consider the case of the writ petitioners sympathetically as and when it decides to grant fresh licences either for the grain market in Sector 26 or for any other market.","The petitioners are carrying on business of selling fruits and vegetables on their ’rehries’ (hand carts) in the grain market in Sector 26 in the city of Chandigarh.

This is an appeal against the judgment and order of the High Court of Orissa, Cuttack in Criminal Appeal Nos.149 and 221 of 1994 dated 24th September, 1997.  The High Court by its impugned judgment and order allowed both the appeals and acquitted the respondents of all the charges levelled against them.  Earlier, the appellants had been conv icted by the trial court under Sections 498A and 304B IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years under Section 498A and 7 years under Section 304B IPC.

As earlier noticed , the High Court by its impugned judgment and order has acquitted all of them of the charges level led against them. We have heard counsel for the parties and we have also perused the records placed before us.  We find ourselves in agreement with the High Court that so far as the allegation s relating to the offence under Section 498A is concerned, the prosecution has not been able t o establish its case against the respondents.  The High Court has considered the evidence on r ecord and we find no reason to interfere with the finding of fact recorded by the High Court.  So far as the offence under Section 304B is concerned, there is no evidence to suggest that soon  befo re the occurrence the deceased was subjected to torture and harassment.  In the absence of any such evidence, conviction   under Section 304B cannot be sustained.  Even the medical evidence on record is rather ambiguous. We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that the High Court has recorded the order of acquittal based on the evidence on record and on proper appreciation of such eviden ce.

Lahoti, CJI Leave granted in SLP (C) No. 3106/2004. In all these appeals, it is not necessary to notice the facts of individual cases.  It would suffice to state that in all these cases, the plaintiff, a woman, had undergone a sterilization operation performed by a surgeon in the employment of the State of Haryana.  Subsequent to the performance of the surgery, the woman became pregnant and delivered a child. Suit was filed against the doctor who had performed the surgery, claiming compensation based on the cause of action of ’unwanted pregnancy’ and ’unwanted child’, attributable to the failure of the surgery. State of Haryana was impleaded, claiming decree against it on the principle of vicarious liability. The suits have been decreed and such decrees have been put in issue by filing these appeals by special leave. A 3-Judge Bench of this Court has held in State of Punjab v. Shiv Ram & Ors. (C.A. 5128 of 2002 decided on August 25, 2005) that child birth in spite of a sterilization operation can occur due to negligence of the doctor in performance of the operation, or due to certain natural causes such as spontaneous recanalisation.  The doctor can be held liable only in cases where the failure of the operation is attributable to his negligence and not otherwise.  Several textbooks on medical negligence have recognized the percentage of failure of the sterilization operation due to natural causes to be varying between 0.3% to 7% depending on the techniques or method chosen for performing the surgery out of the several prevalent and acceptable ones in medical science.  The fallopian tubes which are cut and sealed may reunite and the woman may conceive though the surgery was performed by a proficient doctor successfully by adopting a technique recognized by medical science.  Thus, the pregnancy can be for reasons  de hors any negligence of the surgeon.  In the absence of proof of negligence, the surgeon cannot be held liable to pay compensation.  Then the question of the State being held vicariously liable also would not arise.  The decrees http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 cannot, therefore, be upheld. However, the learned counsel for the appellant-State stated at the very outset that the plaintiffs in all these cases are poor persons and the State was not interested in depriving the decree-holders of the payment made in satisfaction of the decrees but the State was certainly interested in having the question of law settled.  The stand taken by the appellant-State has been that in spite of the decrees under appeal having been set aside, any payment already made thereunder would be treated by the State as ex gratia payment. In view of the law laid down in State of Punjab  v. Shiv Ram & Ors.,(supra) all these appeals are allowed. The judgments and decrees under appeals are set aside. All the suits filed by the plaintiffs-respondents are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs throughout.  However, any amount paid by the appellant-State to the plaintiffs-decree holders shall not be liable to be refunded by way of restitution.","A woman had undergone a sterilization operation performed by a surgeon in the employment of the State of Haryana.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated April  5, 1990  of the  Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High  Court made  in LPA  No.444/90. The land of the respondents, along  with  others,  admeasuring  50.55  acres situated   in    village   Behar   Tehsil,   Pathankot   was requisitioned  and   subsequently   acquired   for   defence purposes under  the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act,  1952  [for  short,  the  ’Act’].    The  Land Acquisition  Officer  had  determined  the  compensation  at Rs.201/- per  canal. When  an application  was made  by  the respondents under  Section 8  of the  Act, the arbitrator in his award dated December 6, 1986 determined the compensation at Rs.1,000/-  per canal. He also awarded solatium @ 30% and interest @ 9% per annum for one year from the date of taking possession and  @ 15%  thereafter till date of deposit. When challenged, the  appeal came  to be dismissed by the learned single Judge  and affirmed  by the Division Bench. Thus this appeal by special leave. The only  question that  arises for  consideration  is: whether the  respondents are  entitled  to  the  payment  of solatium and interest awarded by the arbitrator?. This Court in Union   of  India v. Hari Kishan Khosla [1993 Supp. 2 SCC 149] held  that  the  claimants  are  not  entitled  to  the solatium and interest since the Act does not provide for the payment thereof.  On the  last occasion  when the matter had come up for hearing, this Court passed an order on March 25, 1996 directing  the appellants  to produce  the record of K- Form. A  letter dated  December 19,  1995  has  been  placed before us  by the learned counsel for the appellants stating that the  respondents have  not received  the  amount  under protest nor  have they  made any application for appointment of arbitrator  within the  stipulated period. We need not go into  the   question  as  regards  the  appointment  of  the arbitrator for determination of the compensation against the award of  the Land  Acquisition Officer since that order has become final.  The only question is: whether the respondents are entitled to solatium and interest? http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Learned counsel  for the  respondents sought to contend that  the   Act   provides   for   determination   of   just compensation. All  the three  components form  part  of  the determination of  just compensation and that, therefore, the award  passed   by   the   arbitrator   does   not   warrant interference.  We   find  no   force  in   the   contention. Determination of  just compensation is with reference to the value of  the land acquired under the Act. Since the payment of solatium  and interest is in addition to the compensation determined under the Act, this Court in Hari Kishan Khosla’s case [supra]  had held  that the  arbitrator  is  devoid  of jurisdiction to  award solatium  and interest.  Under  these circumstances, the  High Court  was not  right in  upholding payment of solatium and interest. The appeal  is allowed  to the  extent of  awareding of solatium and  interest and  with respect to determination of compensation @  Rs. 1,000/-  per canal the order of the High Court stands upheld. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the order dated April 5, 1990 of the Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court made in LPA  No.444/90. The land of the respondents, along with  others, admeasuring  50.55 acres situated in Behar Tehsil, Pathankot was requisitioned and acquired for defence purposes under the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952.

Under these circumstances, notice must be deemed  to have  been served on the respondent. He is set ex parte. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Allahabad High  Court made on March 15, 1993 in writ Petition No.  12480/87. The  admitted position is that while the respondent  was working as a Senior Marketing Inspector, a charge-sheet  was served  on  him  on  November  23,  1984 calling upon  him to  explain   the charges  for  committing gross irregularities  in the  movement of  wheat outside the State of  U.P. Instead  of submitting  reply to  the charge- sheet, he  went on  dilly-dallying in  submitting the reply. Several  letters   addressed  to   the   respondent   proved ineffective. Resultantly,  the appellants took a decision on June 26,  1987 holding  that the respondent was found guilty of misappropriation.  Consequently, he  came to be dismissed from service. The respondent challenged the same in the writ petition. The  High Court  has set  aside the  order in  the impugned order  holding   that the  documents have  not been supplied to  the respondent  and, therefore,  the action was vitiated by  error of  law. We do not find any justification in   the view taken by the High Court; the substratum of the result is that the appellants have not conducted any enquiry though the  respondent had  been avoiding to give the reply. Since the respondent had avoided to submit the reply, he has forgone his  right   to submit  his reply.  Nonetheless, the appellants are not absolved of the duty to hold an  ex-parte enquiry to  find out   whether  or not  the charge  has been proved. In  the event  of the  Enquiry Officer find that the charge  is  proved,  he  would  submit  his  report  to  the disciplinary authority.  The disciplinary  authority  should communicate the copy of the enquiry report to the respondent and seek   an  explanation  for the proposed action thereon. If the  respondent submits  any explanation, the same may be taken into consideration and appropriate order may be passed http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 according to  law. Until then, the respondent must be deemed to be under suspension.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R The short question involved in this appeal is as to whether a Typewriter Instructor is a Teacher or not. We have heard the parties at length. According to the University Calender the Teacher shall include Principal, Lecturer, Lecturer in Physical Education, Tutor, Demonstrator, Instructor and Librarian in the service of a Non-Govt. College. It appears that by a letter dated 12.2.1999 an instruction has been issued to clarify the confusion created with regard to the entitlement of vacations by the category of staff such as SLA/JLA/Typewriter Instructor/Tabla Player and Laboratory Attendant as to whether they are entitled to full vacations like Teaching staff or they are non-teaching staff and like any other Government staff they are entitled only to casual leave or other vacations during the year. Clause (1) of the said instructions clearly states that if any University Rules are contrary to the aforesaid instructions they must be amended accordingly. It is stated that the aforesaid Government Circular has been challenged by the respondent before the High Court by filing a writ petition. The High Court has held that the typewriters are entitled to the benefits available to the teaching staff and, therefore, no amendment has been carried out in consonance with the direction contained in the Government order dated 12.2.1999. Having regard to the peculiar facts that some of the respondents have been enjoying the facilities since more than 13 years in accordance with the University Calender we do not want to interfere with the impugned order. We, however, leave the question of law open. We also allow the appellant State to amend the University Calender in terms of the Government order dated 12.2.1999.  Such amendment if any carried out pursuant to the Government order shall be prospective.  If any such amendment is made it shall cover  all cases of the Typewriter Instructors including the case of the respondents herein. This appeal is disposed with the direction indicated above. We make it clear that  the University and other authorities are, however, allowed to amend the Rules in consonance with the Government Order dated 12.2.1999.",The short question involved in this appeal is as to whether a Typewriter Instructor is a Teacher or not.

The appellant herein was acquitted by the Trial Court  for an offence punishable under Section 307 IPC.

The High Court confirmed the said order of conviction. The learned counsel for the appellant stated that so far as the conviction under Section 307, IPC is concerned, it was not challenged by the State and the order had attained finality.  So far as conviction under the Punjab Excise Act is concerned the counsel stated that the maximum punishment :2: imposable for the said offence is three years.  He also stated that the appellant had suffered serious injuries due to  air crash and even now his physical condition is not well and is undergoing treatment.  An affidavit to that effect is also filed.  Necessary material in the form of  photographs and medical certificate are also produced.  He further stated that the appellant has remained in jail for 159 days till today.

" O R D E R Notification   under   Section   4(1)   of   the   Land Acquisition, 1894  (for Short,  the ’Act’)  was published in respect of  different parcels  of lands on February 23, 1964 and March  1, 1964  acquiring an extent of 6.67 acres in the first notification and 2.75 acres in the second notification for the  purpose of  setting up spinning mill. The lands are situated near  Nagpur Municipal  Corporation practically now within urban  agglomeration. The Land Acquisition Officer in his award dated October 6, 1966, determined the compensation @  Rs.5,000/-   per  acre  in  respect  of  some  lands  and Rs.3,000/- per  acre in  respect of other lands in the first notification and  Rs.2,000/- per  acre for  the lands in the second notification  and solatium and interest under Section 23(2) and Section 34 of the Act. On reference  the civil Court by decree and award dated November 18,  1968 enhanced  the compensation to Rs.0.40 per sq.ft. On  appeal by  the State  and cross-objection  by the claimants, the  High Court  reversed the decree and award of the  reference   Court  and   confirmed  the  award  of  the Collector. Thus, these appeals by special leave. Though learned  counsel for  the appellants  stated that the High Court  was in  error in  not relying upon the sale deed (Exts. 39 and 40) to an extent of Rs.5,000/- per sq. ft. and Rs. 4,000/-  per sq.ft.  respectively, the  High  Court  was wholly right  in its  conclusion for the reason that neither the  sale  deeds  not  the  certified  copies  thereof  were exhibited  in   the  Court.   In  these  circumstances,  the documents are  inadmissible, though  the witnesses, AW 9 and 10 have been examined to speak on these transactions. In the absence of  the sale deeds, no oral evidence could be relied upon. The  reference Court  had committed  manifest error of law in relying on that evidence. But the fact that the lands are very near to the city and possessed of a potential value is not  in dispute. Under these circumstances, we think that the appropriate course would be that the market value of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 lands in  respect of  which Rs.5,000/-  was awarded  by  the Collector shall be determined @ Rs. 8,000/- per acre and the lands for  which Rs.3,000/-  was awarded,  would be valued @ Rs. 6,000/-  per acre.  Similarly, in  the  case  of  second notification,  the   market  value  would  be  determined  @ Rs.4,000/- per acre. The award and decree of the reference Court is modified to the  above extent. The claimants are entitled to solatium and interest  under Section  23(2) @  15%  on  the  enhanced compensation and  interest under  Section 28  @ 6% per annum from the  date of  taking possession till date of deposit of enhanced compensation.

The contention  of the petitioner in the above  case is  that on a true construction of section 6 read with  section 2(gg)  of the  Madhya Pradesh  Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 452 1960 (Act  No. 20  of 1960) (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’) each member of the family, including a minor son would become a  holder entitled  to a separate unit of the ceiling area., In  other words, it is argued that a minor son who is deemed to  be entitled  to an  area  of  joint  family  land proportionate to his share under section 6(ii) of the Act is entitled to  claim a separate ceiling area independently. It is contended  that his  share of land cannot be clubbed with the land  which can  be claimed by his father as his ceiling area, We have heard Shri G.L. Sanghi, learned counsel for the petitioner. He  has taken us through the relevant provisions of the  Act viz.  section 2 (gg), section 6 and section 7 of the Act.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. AR . Lakshmanan, J. Although respondent is served, nobody appears for the respondent. This appeal is directed against the final judgment dated 3rd September, 2002 of the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench, in S.B.Civil Second Appeal No.138 of 1997. We have heard Mr. S.K. Jain, learned counsel for the appellants.  The respondent was appointed as a Conductor on daily wages by the Corporation.  His services were terminated as the same were not required by the Corporation.  The High Court, without considering the fact that the respondent being daily wager has no substantive right to hold the post, however, has committed serious error in dismissing the second appeal filed by the Corporation and affirming the judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Court and also of the Trial Court.    In our view, the High Court has committed a grave error in not considering the fact that the respondent being workman and a dispute being an industrial dispute, Civil Court has no jurisdiction and try the suit for reinstatement. Trial Court which passed the decree has got no pecuniary jurisdiction and, therefore, the decree passed by the Trial Court is without jurisdiction.  The above submission made by Mr. S.K. Jain merit acceptance.  In fact, in the written statement filed by the appellant Corporation, the question of jurisdiction has been specifically raised.  The Court has also framed an issue in regard to the jurisdiction and hearing by the Civil Court.  However, the said issue has not been rightly considered and properly answered. The case on hand is covered by a very recent decision of this Court reported in 2005 (7) SCC 447 (decided by Mrs. Justice Ruma Pal and Dr. Justice AR. Lakshmanan).  The said appeal was filed by the very same Road Transport Corporation, against its workman, who was appointed as Conductor on probation and his services were terminated by the Corporation, which was challenged by the workman.  The very same workman had approached the Civil Court and obtained a decree, which was affirmed by the Appellate Court and also by the High Court, against which Civil Appeal No.5176 of 2005 was filed by the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation in this Court.  This Court, after hearing the counsel appearing for the respective parties, held that the only remedy available to the workman was by way of reference under the Industrial Disputes Act and not by way of a suit.  This Court also held that the workman in that case was also not entitled to the protection under Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India. This Court also held that if the Court has no jurisdiction, the jurisdiction cannot be conferred by any order of the Court.  This Court also held that where an Act creates an obligation and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 enforces the performance in a specified manner, the performance cannot be enforced in any other manner.  The respondent in that case has failed to approach the remedies provided under the Industrial Disputes Act. In the instant case also, the respondent, who is also similarly placed as in the other case covered by the Industrial Disputes Act, has failed to approach the Industrial Court, but approached the Civil Court, which on the facts and circumstances of the case had no jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit. Therefore, this judgment (supra) rendered by this Court squarely applies to the facts and circumstances of this case.  In our view, the respondent is not entitled for any payment by way of salary or other wages.  He is also not entitled for any reinstatement or back wages.  However, if the respondent has already been paid some amount, the same amount may not be recovered from him.  We make it clear that the respondent shall not be entitled to continue in service any further and he shall not be entitled for any wages except to already paid to him.  The respondent shall be discharged forthwith. The Appeal is accordingly allowed.  There shall be no orders as to costs.","This appeal is directed against the final judgment dated 3rd September, 2002 of the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench, in S.B.Civil Second Appeal No.138 of 1997.

Obulesu [P.W.11] stated that death was caused as a result of cumulative effect of all the injuries.  Mohammed Syeed [P.W.1] stated, during the course of cross examination, that the appellant assaulted the deceased on the right shoulder.  The doctor in his evidence, has nowhere stated that the injury on the right shoulder, i.e., injury No.1, was a fatal one.  As the appellant cannot be said to have inflicted the fatal injury, the High Court was not justified in upholding his conviction under Section 302 I.P.C.  The appellant could not have been convicted under Section 302/34 I.P.C., as there was nobody else with whom he could have shared the common intention in view of the fact that there were only four accused persons, out of whom, three persons have been already acquitted.  In view of these facts, we are of the view that the High Court was not justified in upholding the conviction of the appellant.

In the appeal 399 before  the  High Court the only question raised  was  that though Occurrence took place on 31-5-1974 challan was  filed on 29-8-1977, therefore, no cognizance could have been taken in view of Section 468 CrPC.  The High Court has  considered this  aspect  and after referring to Section 473  CrPC  held that  in the facts and circumstances of the case  the  court can take cognizance if the delay has been properly explained or that it is necessary to do so in the interest of justice.

" O R D E R K. VENKATASWAMI, J. These two special leave petitions are preferred against the common  judgment and order in e.j.c. Nos. 263 and 879 of 1991 dated  13.9.1993 passed  by the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack. The petitioners  who were  unsuccessful before the High Court are  the employees  of  Rourkela  Steel  Plant.  Being aggrieved  by  the  promotion  policy  and  rules  of  Steel Authority of  India Limited  (hereinafter referred to as the ’SAIL’) as  adopted in the year 1986 superseding the earlier policy holding  the field,  they challenged  the same before the  High  Court.  Incidentally  they  also  challenged  the promotions made  on the  basis  of  the  impugned  promotion policy. Be it noted, it does not appear from the judgment of the High  Court that  there was  any challenge  of promotion given to private opposite parties individually. Before the  High Court  several contentions were raised challenging the  impugned  promotion  policy.  However,  the learned Judges while upholding the promotion policy impugned before them  made certain  directions in  paragraph  12  and observations in paragraphs 15 and 19 of their judgment. Mr. P.P.  Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners, in  view of  the directions in paragraph 12 and observations made  in paragraphs 15 and 19 of the High Court judgment, fairly stated before us that he is not challenging the legality  and validity of the impugned promotion policy. Nevertheless he  wanted to challenge the promotions given to respondents 4  to 17  in one Special Leave Petition and 4 to 31 in  other/second Special  Leave Petition. When we pointed out that  no such  individual challenge  to promotion of the above mentioned  respondents was  made before the High Court and in  view of  the fact  that there is no challenge to the promotion policy  before us,  there is  no  scope  for  such contention, the  learned counsel  submitted that  before the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 High Court the promotions were also challenged. As we stated earlier, promotions as a whole were challenged on the ground that promotion  policy impugned  before the  High Court  was illegal, arbitrary  and liable  to be  struck down.  If that basis does  not now  survive in view of the directions given by the  High  Court,  there  does  not  remain  any  serious challenge to  individual promotions given to the respondents mentioned above. We may  also point  out that  in view  of the fact that individual promotions  were not  challenged, presumably  the concerned respondents  did not  appear before the High Court as well as in this Court in spite of notice. Further we find from the  judgment of the High Court that the learned Judges have gone  into the documents made available before them and recorded a finding as follows :- ""From what has been stated above, we are satisfied that  the SAIL  has taken  all efforts humanly  possible to  see that a true appraisal  is made  of an executive before he  is promoted  from the post of Assistant Manager to Deputy Manager."" In view  of the above finding and in the absence of any other material  to hold  otherwise, we do not think there is any cause for interference. In the  result, the  Special Leave  Petitions fail  and are, accordingly, dismissed.",Two special leave petitions are preferred against the common judgment and order in e.j.c.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. No doubt  this  appeal  arises  from  an  interlocutory application,  since   it  has  an  effect  on  the  judicial proceedings that  have become  final; we  think that at this stage, it would be appropriate to interfere with this matter and correct it. This appeal  by special leave arises from the order and judgment of  the High  Court of Karnataka made on 20.10.1995 in  C.R.P.   No.420/95.  Admittedly,   the   appellant   had instituted the suit for partition and separate possession of the suit  property  in  1966  in  Suit  No.88/66  which  was dismissed on  February 20, 1988. On appeal, after the remand by  the   High  Court,   Appeal  No.98/88  culminated  in  a compromise. A  compromise decree  was passed on February 29, 1990 (sic.).  Thereunder the  appellant was  given from  the total extent of 3 acres 39 guntas of lands towards his share and decree  in that  behalf was  passed. under the Panchnama drawn by  the Tehsildar  on July  22, 1993 the appellant was put in  possession of 39 guntas of land as per the certified copies of  the Panchnama  filed in  the trial  Court as Item No.17 of  the documents  filed  in  the  present  suit.  The district Court  also in  the present  proceedings recorded a finding in paragraph 14 of its order that the appellant. was put in possession of 39 guntas of land. The question,  therefore arises:  whether an injunction can be  issued against  the appellant?  It is not in dispute that pending  that partition  suit No.88/66,  the respondent had purchased the land belonging to his vendors including 39 guntas of land under registered sale deed dated February 24. l986. Undoubtedly  the respondent  was not  a party  to  the compromise  decree   dated  February   29,  1990.  Since  he purchased the property pending the suit for partition, a compromise  decree having  been executed by the parties in which the  right of the appellant to the extent of 39 guntas was  crystallized   and  he  was  duly  put  in  possession, necessarily, he  was in lawful possession of the property as an owner.  The question  is: whether  an injunction  can  be issued  against  the  lawful  owner?  It  is  settled  legal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 position that  no injunction  can be issued against a lawful owner of  the property.  The High  Court  proceeded  on  the premise that  the appellant  was put  in possession  of  the property after  the interim  injunction was  granted by  the trial Court.  It is factually incorrect since the injunction was granted  by the  trial Court  only on January 5, 1994 by which date  he had  already been  put in  possession by  the Tehsildar under  the Panchnama  dated July  22, 1993.  Under these circumstances,  the High  Court also  was in  error in coming to  the conclusion  that the  appellant cannot  be in lawful possession  since he had come in possession after the injunction was issued under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of CPC. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  orders of the courts below  stand set  aside.  But  in  the  circumstances without costs. It  is   made  clear  that  since  the  respondent  has purchased the property pending the suit, it would be open to him to proceed against his vendor in accordance with law.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the order and judgment of the High  Court of Karnataka made on 20.10.1995 in C.R.P.

" JUDGMENT ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. These appeals by the assessee are directed against the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in appeals purported to be under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short the ‘Act’). The appeals were filed by the revenue questioning correctness of certain conclusions arrived at by the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bangalore Bench (in short the ‘Tribunal’) in appeals filed by the assessee as well as the revenue. The dispute relates to the assessment year 1995-96. The relevant factual details have been noted in Civil Appeal No. 4232 of 2003 and other cases (M. Janardhan Rao v. Joint Commissioner of Income Tax etc. etc.) disposed of today, and are not repeated here. The assessee was described as A.O.P.-3 by the revenue authorities in the concerned assessment proceedings. Questioning correctness of certain conclusion by the Tribunal, revenue had preferred appeals before the High Court. The High Court has held that the Tribunal’s views in respect of Question Nos. (iii), (v) and (vii) as formulated were not in order, and accordingly allowed the appeals filed by the revenue in part. The basic issues which form the core dispute have been dealt with in the appeals filed by the assessees and disposed of, as noted supra, today. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the conclusions of the High Court have been arrived at without any discussion and reasons have not been indicated as to why seal of approval was being put on the findings recorded by the Tribunal. Per contra, learned counsel for the revenue supported judgment of the High Court. According to him, when views of Tribunal and first appellate authority were being affirmed, there was no need to record reasons separately. So far as the issues covered by judgment in C.A. No. 4232 of 2003 etc. etc. as noted above, are concerned, the order shall cover these appeals also. In addition, question Nos. (iii), (v) and (vii) as noted in High Court’s judgment are concerned, need to be adjudicated afresh. It is true in an order of affirmation, repetition of reasons elaborately may not be necessary. But even then the arguments advanced, points urged have to be dealt with. Reasons for affirmation have to be indicated, though in appropriate cases may be briefly stated. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Recording of reasons is a part of fair procedure. Reasons are harbinger between the mind of maker of the decision in the controversy and the decision or conclusion arrived at. They substitute subjectivity with objectivity. As observed in Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree, (1974) L.C.R. 120, failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice. In the aforesaid background, we remit the matter to High Court to consider question Nos. (iii), (v) and (vii) afresh along with other matters covered by judgment in C.A. No. 4232 of 2003 etc. etc. disposed of today.

One Hari Singh Malhiyan, elder brother of the appellant,  is alleged to have deposit ed 80 currency notes of Rs.1000/- denomination in his capacity as Karta of a H.U.F. with the State Bank of India, Parliament Street Branch, in view of the promulgation of the High Denomination Banks Notes (Demonitisation) Ordinance, 1978.  Subsequently, he filed an application for recovery of the said amount, but since the same was rejected, he filed Civil Writ Petition No.1764/1980 for quashing the orders of rejection dated 2nd February, 1980 and 4th July, 1980, passed by the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Finance,  Department  of Economic  Affairs and the Chief Currency Officer, Reserve Bank  of India (Issue Department), New Delhi.  A writ in the nature of mandamus was also sought for against the said respondents, to direct them to pay the petitioner Rs.80,000/- in exchange f or the 80 currency notes of the denomination of Rs.1000/- each. The said writ petition was dismissed for default on 4th January, 2002, but the writ petitioner Hari Singh Malhiyan did not take any steps to restore the same. Subsequently, the present appellant filed an application for impleadment and restora tion of the said writ petition which was dismissed.  Without pursuing the matter further, the appellant filed a separate writ petition, being No.467 of 2006, inter alia, for a writ in th e nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to release his 1/5th share in the said 80 currency notes of Rs.1000/- denomination with interest @ 18% from 1978 till final payment. The said writ application came up before the Delhi High Court on 20th January, 2006 when it appears that no one was present on behalf of the petitioner and the High Court found that the appellant’s earlier application for impleadment had been dismissed.  Having also found that the  appellant  had  not  filed his claim on behalf of the H.U.F., the High Court held that the appellant could not at that stage claim that the currency notes in question belongs to the H.U.F.  On that reasoning the High Court dismissed the writ petition and it is against such order of dismissal that the appellant has filed the special leave petition. Having heard learned counsel of the respective parties and having seen that the earl http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ier writ petition filed by the elder brother of the appellant had been filed in his personal capacity and also noticing that the appellant herein has filed a separate suit for partition wherein the said sum of Rs.80,000/- is also included, we are of the view that no interference is called for i n the present appeal  since the appellant would be at liberty to press his claim with regard to th e said amount in the suit itself. In that view of the matter, we dismiss the appeal, but we also observe that it will be open to the appellant to urge the points taken herein in the pending suit.

" ORDER 1.This  appeal is directed against the order of the  High Court  of Delhi.  The appellant was tried by  Summary  Court Martial  and  was  sentenced to undergo  nine  months  civil imprisonment  and dismissal from service.  The  question  of law   raised  is  that  Summary  Court  Martial   that   was constituted was not presided over by a Commanding Officer as required under Section 116 of the Army Act.  The  submission is  that some of the records supplied to the appellant  show that  it was only an officer of the rank of a  Captain  that presided and he cannot be deemed to be a Commanding Officer. The High Court dismissed the writ petition observing that it had  perused  the record as well as the evidence and  it  is satisfied  that the Summary Court Martial was presided  over by Lt.  Col.  Sandhu, a Commanding Officer. 2.The learned counsel, however, submits that the  records supplied to the appellant do not disclose the same fact.  We have  perused the records and we agree with the  High  Court that the Summary Court Martial constituted was presided over by  Mr Sandhu, the Commanding Officer.  Therefore, there  is no force in the submission. 3.The   learned  counsel,  however,  submits   that   the appellant was released on bail by this Court and he has been in jail for a period of over five months and that it is  not a case where the appellant may be sent back to jail at  such distance  of  time.  The act of indiscipline  was  committed sometime prior to 1980.  So far as this aspect is concerned, it  is  for  the Army Authority  concerned  to  consider  it whether the appellant should again be sent back to jail  for serving out the remaining small portion of sentence or remit the same.

Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned senior counsel for the State. 2.      The appellant was convicted by Principal Sessions Judge, Kanyakumari Division at Nagercoil by judgment dated 5.10.1998 for offences punishable under sections 302 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment (section 302 IPC) and one month’s RI (section 341 IPC). The appeal filed by the appellant challenging the said judgment was dismissed by the Madras High Court by its judgment dated 7.1.2003, thereby confirming the conviction and sentence. 3.      The prosecution case was that the deceased John Reghu was learning auto driving from his friend PW-4 \026 Selvan Daniel. The appellant Stanly Moses took on hire the autorickshaw  owned  by PW 4.  When   PW 4       demanded the auto rickshaw hire charges from the appellant, the deceased John Reghu supported PW 4 and asked the appellant to pay the hire charges to PW 4. The appellant objected to it and there was a quarrel between the deceased and the appellant. On the date of the incident (27.8.1996) the appellant went to the house of the deceased and inquired whether the deceased was at home. PW-1, the mother of the deceased, stated that he was not at home. The appellant went away making threats against the deceased. Later, on the same day, appellant met the deceased and there ensued a quarrel between them and the appellant stabbed the deceased who died as a result of the injury sustained. PW1 (mother of the deceased) and PW2 (sister of the deceased) were the two eye witnesses who supported the prosecution case. Their evidence was believed by the Sessions Court and the High Court. We find no reason to disbelieve their evidence as to what transpired on that day or the finding of guil t recorded by the courts below. 4.      Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the quarrel between the appellant and the deceased was over a petty issue and was of a sudden nature and the appellant has caused only one injury on the deceased and therefore the offence did not come within the purview of section 302 IPC. Learned senior counsel appearing for the State, on the other hand, contended that the appellant had caused the death of the deceased with pre- meditation and therefore the offence will fall under section 302 IPC. 5.      The prosecution evidence shows that there was a quarrel over a petty issue between the appellant and the deceased. The incident happened on a public road. The post mortem conducted    on    the    deceased    showed    only    one   stab   injury   on the    deceased. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 There is no dispute as to the nature of the quarrel between the appellant and the deceased or about the fact that there was only one injury on the deceased. On considering the entire facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the culpable homicide by the appellant did not amount to murder, as exception 4 to section 300 IPC was attracted and that the offence was punishable only under section 304 Part I of IPC and not section 302 IPC. Consequently, the conviction of the appellant under section 302 IPC is set aside and instead he is found guilty of offence punishable under section 304 Part I and is sentenced to undergo ten years’ rigorous imprisonment. The conviction and sentence under section 341 IPC remain undisturbed. 6.      The appeal is disposed of accordingly, modifying the sentence to the extent mentioned above.","The appellant was convicted by Principal Sessions Judge, Kanyakumari Division at Nagercoil by judgment dated 5.10.1998 for offences punishable under sections 302 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R Heard learned counsel for the parties. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 25.04.2001 passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench in Respondents’ Civil Revision Petition No. 521/2001 whereby the learned Single Judge has reversed the order dated 17.3.2001 of the Addl. District Judge No. 2, Jaipur City, Jaipur by which order the  learned Addl. District Judge has dismissed the appeal filed by the respondents herein against the order of  Trial Court which had determined interim rent as per provisions of Section 13(3) of the Rajasthan Premises (Control of Rent & Eviction) Act, 1950 (hereinafter for short the ""Act""). We need not go into the chequered history of the matter.  Suffice it to say that the appellants herein have purchased the suit properties being two shops by two separate registered sale deeds and the same were duly registered with the Sub-Registrar, Jaipur on 16.5.1994. Thereafter, the appellants demanded rent from the respondents and on their refusal to pay rent, they filed a suit for eviction of the respondents herein.  In the said suit, the Trial Court determined the interim rent payable by the respondents, which was affirmed by the First Appellate Court.  Against the said fixation of interim rent by the Trial Court, which was affirmed by the First Appellate Court, the respondents herein moved a Revision Petition before the High Court.  Since, the revision petition was not maintainable before the High Court, the appellants have moved this Court by the present appeal. A suit for specific performance was filed by the respondents herein on the ground that they had entered into an agreement to sale and therefore they are not likely to be evicted from the suit shops. The said suit was contested by the parties hereto and the same has been dismissed by the Trial Court and a decree of specific performance has not been granted.  However, the Trial Court directed the respondents herein to refund the amount of Rs.1,29,000/- with interest.  Against that order the appellants, as also the respondents, herein filed two separate appeals before the High Court.  The said appeals are pending. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that in terms of proviso to Section 115 of the Code Of Civil Procedure,   the High Court ought not to have entertained the revision petition filed by the respondents as the order of fixation of rent was purely an interlocutory order.  Be that as it may, we need not go into this question at this stage as in order to put the present controversy to an end, we thing it just and proper that the respondents shall continue to deposit in Court the rent month by month and it will be open for the appellants to withdraw the same amount on furnishing bank guarantee till the amount of rent reaches Rs.1,29,000/-.  In case the appeals are not disposed of by the High Court and the deposit of rent exceeds the amount of Rs.1,29,000/-  the respondents will continue to deposit the rent but then it will be open for the appellants to withdraw th e amount without furnishing any bank guarantee. We make it clear that the abovesaid arrangement has been made by us in order to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 decide the equities between the parties, as  in the present case, the parties are seriously contesting the appeals against the order of refusal to grant a decree of specific performance and the refund of Rs.1,29,000/-to the appellants herein.

Thereafter, respondent having evil designs on her started pressurizing her to break off her engagement and marry him, though he was 48 years of age and already married having two children. The petitioner and her mother warned the respondent that he should not harbour such feelings. The respondent became furious and threatened the petitioner that he would not allow her to live in peace. 2.      According to her, with a view to spoil her marriage prospects, the respondent filed a frivolous civil suit against the petitioner, her brothers and other relatives; that in furtherance of his evil designs, he also forged a letter dated 19.12.2006 purporting to have been authored by the petitioner addressed to his friends at Mumbai, making defamatory imputations against him, and on that basis filed a complaint before the Metropolitan Magistrate (49th Court), Mumbai under section 200 Cr.P.C. in January, 2007, praying that the petitioner be summoned, tried and penalized for the offence of defamation. The learned Magistrate has issued summons to the petitioner in the said case. The petitioner has filed this petition for transfer of the said criminal proceedings bearing CC No.6/SS/2007 from the Court of the Special Metropolitan Magistrate, 47th Court, Vikhroli, Mumbai to any court in Delhi. The petitioner contends that though the respondent resides in Delhi, he has filed the complaint in Mumbai to put her to hardship, both financially and otherwise as she will be required to travel all the way to Mumbai and appear in the case on several hearings;  that the respondent may resort to third degree methods in Mumbai; and that he may harass her by seeking unnecessary adjournments. 3.      The respondent has resisted the petition by filing a counter, alleging that the petitioner developed intimacy with him and was requesting him to marry her; and that she had defamed him by writing letters to his friends making false allegations. He has contended that she will not be put to any hardship as she can seek exemption from personal appearance in the Mumbai court. According to him, his main witnesses are at Mumbai and they will not be able to come over to Delhi if the case is transferred. He also http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 stated that the apprehensions of petitioner that he will seek unnecessary adjournments or indulge in any harassment tactics, are without basis. When the matter came up for hearing today, the respondent who appears in person, also submitted that the petitioner is now married and is no longer residing in Delhi but is residing in Punjab and therefore, there is no need to transfer the case to Delhi. 4.      Both sides have made several allegations in regard to the merits. We do not propose to examine them in this case as the scope of transfer proceedings is limited. 5.      We are satisfied that petitioner will be put to considerable hardship if she is required to contest the matter in Mumbai. On the facts and circumstances, the case deserves to be transferred to Delhi, as requested by the petitioner. 6.      We accordingly allow this petition and direct transfer of CC No.6/SS/2007, titled Vipin Kumar Gupta vs. Gurpreet Kaur from the Court of the Special Metropolitan Magistrate (47th Court), Vikhoroli, Mumbai to the court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, who shall either dispose of the case himself or assign it to any other Magistrate in Delhi.",Petitioner claims that respondent was her mother’s counsel in a number of matrimonial and maintenance cases filed by her mother against her father.

" THE 10TH DAY OF MAY, 1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.B. Pattanaik C.B.Babu, B.Krishna Prasad and P.Parmeshwaran, Advs. for the appellants. O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. Though the  respondents have  been served, none appears either in  person or  through the  counsel.   We have  heard counsel for the appellant. This appeal arises from the order of the Division Bench of the  Guwahati High  Court in  a batch  of writ  petitions being Civil  Rule No. 1153/89 and batch passed on dated July 30,  1990.    The  Railway  administration  had  prepared  a preferential traffic  scheme (PTS),  by general  order No.71 categorising the  priority articles for carriage by railways and  allotted   different  priorities   which  are  made  in alphabetic orders  A  to  E.  sponsored  coal  movement  was mentioned in  Category  C  priority  and  priority  E  would include non-sponsored  coal.   Subsequently  by  proceedings dated March 1, 1989 the Railways modified its earlier scheme and issued general PTS Order No.77 with effect from April 1, 1989 under  which priorities  were redetermined.   It  would appear that  subsequently non-priorities  coal  item  E  was deleted from  the priority scheme.  When the respondents and others challenged its validity on the anvil of Art. 19(1)(g) of the  Constitution, the  Division Bench  of the High Court without disturbing  the validity  of  the  order  had  given direction observing that after all the priorities enumerated in the  scheme are  exhausted  and  if  the  wagons  remains unutilised,  the  unutilised  wagons  may  be  kept  at  the disposal of  non-priority articles  for carriage.  Thus this appeal came to be filed by special leave. It is  seen that  in order No.75 priorities A to E were made which included sponsored coal within the meaning of the order and non-sponsored coal within the meaning of the order and non-sponsored  coal provided in priority E for allotment of  wagon.     With   regard  to  non-priority  item  E,  it http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 subsequently deleted  as mentioned  in paragraph  E  of  the special leave  petition which  reads  as  ""the  Order  No.77 relates to PTS for allotment of wagons which came into force from 16.7.86, but non-sponsored coal referred to in priority E of  PTS No.75  was removed"".   It  would thus be seen that non-priority coal  came to  be removed  from the  priorities mentioned in  Items A  to  E.    Therefore  the  High  Court obviously was  of the  intention to direct that if after the wagons allotted  for movement  to priority articles remained available,  the   same  may  be  allotted  for  non-priority articles for  carriage.   We do  not think that there is any impediment  in  the  way  of  administration  to  give  such allotment, instead  of keeping  them side.   It  would be in commercial interest of the Railway administration. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.  No costs.",This appeal arises from the order of the Division Bench of the Guwahati High Court in a batch of writ  petitions. The Railway administration had prepared a preferential traffic scheme (PTS) under which non-priorities  coal was deleted from the priority scheme.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises against the order of the  Division Bench  of the  High Court  of Patna,  dated September 21,  1993 made  in CWJA No.2811/93. Admittedly the respondent had  entered into an agreement with the appellant Board for  supply  of  electricity  pursuant  to  which  the respondent  was   required  to  pay  the  minimum  guarantee charges. When  a bill  was issued,  it would appear that the respondent had objected to the minimum guarantee bill on the ground that  there was erratic supply of electricity and the Board   unable  to  supply  the  required  quantity  of  the electricity. Consequently  the respondent  to not  liable to pay the minimum guarantee under the  contract the High Court allowed  the  writ  petition  finding  that  on  an  earlier occasion the  High Court  in CWJC No.3642/92 had disposed of writ petitions  on February  25, 1923 directing the Board to raise fresh   bill  giving proportionate  reduction  in  the annual minimum  guarantee charges,  but the  same not  being complied with  it is  not open to the Board to give the bill as impugned in the writ petition. It is seen that clause 13 of the agreement provides a under: ""13. -  if at any time the consumer is  prevented   from  receiving  or using the  electrical energy  to be supplied   under   this   agreement either in  whole, or in part due to strike,   riots,    fire,   floods, explosions, act of God or any other case reasonably  beyond control  or if  the  Board  is  prevented  from supplying or  unable to supply such electrical energy  owing to  any or all of  the cause  mentioned  above http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 than   the    demand   charge   and guaranteed, energy  charge set  out in   the Schedule  shall be reduced in proportion to the ability of the consumer to  take or  the Board  to supply such  power and the decision of the  Chief Engineer, Bihar State Electricity Board,  in this respect shall be final. Note:  The   term  Chief   Engineer includes additional  Chief Engineer for the area concerned."" A reading thereof would clearly indicate that the Board is enjoined to give proportionate reduction provided any one of  the   conditions  enumerated   therein  had  occasioned. Obviously, an  application in  that behalf shall be required to be  filed to  the Chief  Engineer of  the Board  who  was required  to  investigate  into  the  matter  and  then  his decision  shall   be  final.   It  would   appear   that   a representation was  made, but it is not clear whether it was to the  Chief Engineer,  the competent authority in terms of the  agreement   or   any   other   officer.   Under   these circumstances,  unless   an  application   is  made  to  the competent authority  to investigate  into  the  matter,  the board in  terms of  clause 13 of the contract is necessarily obliged to  demand and  the consumer  is to  comply with the payment  of   minimum  guarantee  amount  in  terms  of  the agreement subject  to the  decision by  the Chief  Engineer. Accordingly we  set aside the order of the High Court giving liberty to  the respondents  to make  an application  afresh within a period of one month from the date of the receipt of this order  to the  Chief Engineer,  Electricity Board.  The Chief Engineer  would enquire  into and give the decision in that behalf. In the event, the Chief Engineer finds that the Board was responsible, then necessarily, in terms of clause the proportionate reduction is required to be given to the respondents. The appeal is accordingly ordered. No costs.","This appeal  by special  leave arises against the order of the Division Bench  of the High Court  of Patna,  dated September 21,  1993.

" O R D E R Leave granted in SLP. The only  question  that  arises  in  these  cases  is: whether the  respondents, having  agreed under Section 11(2) of the  Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the ’Act’) to payment of  the compensation  in terms  of the  agreement  @ Rs.140/- per  guntha besides  the additional compensation at the rate  of 20%  on account  of development of the land and solatium @ 15% and interest prevailing as on that date, were entitled to  claim the benefit under the Amendment Act 68 of 1984? This  Court in  State Gujarat  & Ors.  vs. Daya Shamji Bhai &  Ors. [(1995)  5 SCC  746]  considered  the  question elaborately and  held that  the parties  having entered into the  agreement   under  Section  11(2)  were  bound  by  the agreement and thereby, they were not entitled to any benefit other than  what was  agreed upon. Therefore, the High Court was not  right in  the impugned  order passed  in the review petition in  allowing the  enhancement under  the  Amendment Act. It is sought to be contended by the learned counsel for the respondents  that under clause 16 of the agreement since there is  no agreement  as regards the rate of interest, the claimants are  entitled to  statutory rate of interest under Section 28  as  amended  in  Act  68  of  1984.  We  do  not appreciate the  contention to  be  correct.  Parties  having agreed to  the payment  of  interest  on  the  date  of  the contract, the  rate of  interest admittedly payable being 4- 1/2%, they are entitled to interest at 4-1/2% and not to the enhanced rates  under proviso  to Section  28 of the Act, as amended by Act 68 of 1984.

" JUDGMENT S.B. SINHA, J. The appellant before us is the husband of the deceased Sumitra. They were married on 7.2.1984. A child was born to them in 1985. The incident occurred on 11.3.1987 at about 11.00 a.m. Indisputably, the two-year old child of the appellant was also injured in that incident. It has also not been disputed that the father of the appellant received burn injuries when he tried to save the lady and the child. Whereas the deceased Sumitra died on the spot, her son and father-in-law died subsequently. Three witnesses, namely, both the parents and the brother of the deceased were examined to prove the purported demand of dowry and harassment allegedly meted out to the deceased by the appellant. The entire prosecution case is based on some letters which were said to have been written by the deceased and her husband in the years 1984-85. The learned Trial Judge as also the High Court based their entire judgments of conviction and sentence on the basis of said letters and the conduct of the appellant and other family members. From a perusal of the judgment of the High Court it appears that the appellant is said to have demanded some money from his in-laws to raise some construction. The High Court opined that the said  demand does not strictly come within the purview of the definition of dowry. But despite the same, it proceeded to hold that such demands spoil the atmosphere of the matrimonial home; the wife was embarrassed and as a result of such embarrassment committed suicide. As regards the fact that the appellant’s father had tried to save the lady and the child, who ultimately died, was although considered by the High Court, but it proceeded to hold that he also must have known the contents of the letters (Exts PU and PU/1) and the behaviour of his son to be totally untoward a married life and he did not resort to anything which could have solved the problem in the family. The High Court states: ""He may not have contributed the deceased to have died but he also did not help her the live. In such a situation even if he tried to save the infant and the daughter-in-law, it could not absolve the appellant of his misdeeds which are proved and as referred to above are in writing. The husband was supposed to bring cordiality, cooperation and peach in the home even if he needed some monetary help from the others instead of maltreating his wife which led to such a grave situation which he did not contemplate that his son could be lost."" Having considered the judgment of the High Court, we are of the opinion that the approach of the High Court is not correct. As the purported demand made by the husband had no direct nexus or immediate cause for commission of suicide by his wife, the same would not amount to abetment of commission of such suicide. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The very fact that the High Court has proceeded on the basis that the demand made by the husband did not amount to dowry, in our opinion, negates the prosecution case. It should not have jumped to the conclusion that the same must have caused embarrassment to the deceased which led to her commission of suicide. The observations were in the realm of conjectures and surmises. In a criminal case, no conviction can be based on conjectures and surmises. The prosecution should have proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is accepted a the Bar that when the incident took place, the appellant was not in his house. He was prosecuted together with his brother. The learned Trial Judge acquitted the brother of the appellant. This fact also should have been taken into consideration  by the High Court. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that it is a fit case where the appellant is entitled to benefit of doubt. Accordingly, the impugned judgment passed by the High Court and the judgment and order of the Trial Court are set aside and the appeal is allowed. The appellant is on bail, the his bail bonds shall stand discharged.","The High Court opined that the said demand does not strictly come within the purview of the definition of dowry.

" RAJENDRA BABU, J. : This matter involves interpretation as to the scope of Section 630 of the Companies Act, 1956 [hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’].  This Court in Abhilash Vinodkumar Jain (Smt.) vs. Cox & Kings (India) Ltd. & Ors., 1995 (3) SCC 732 has explained that the expression ’officer or employee’ used in Section 630 of the Act should be given a broad meaning in the light of the decision of this Court in Baldev Krishna Sahi v. Shipping Corporation of India Ltd., 1987 (4) SCC 361 and Amrit Lal Chum v. Devoprasad Dutta, 1988 (2) SCR 783.  The object of the said provision was explained to be not strictly penal in nature but quasi criminal, the main object being to provide speedy relief to the company where its property is wrongfully obtained or wrongfully withheld by an employee or ex-employee or anyone claiming under them.  Indeed this Court explained the position as follows: ""It would defeat the ’beneficent’ provision and ignore the factual realities that the legal heirs or family members who are continuing in possession of the allotted property had obtained the right of occupancy with the employee concerned in the property of the employer only by virtue of their relationship with the employee/officer and had not obtained or acquired the right to possession of the property in any other capacity, status or right."" [p.741] [emphasis supplied] On that basis ultimately, this Court concluded that the employee would include the legal heirs of the deceased employee. When the matter came up before another bench of this Court in J.K.[Bombay] Ltd. vs. Bharti Matha Mishra (Mrs.) & Ors., 2001 (2) SCC 700, it was held that though the expression ’officer or employee of a company’ would include past officer or employee of the company or his legal heirs or representatives but does not include other members of his family and further stated that the provision cannot be liberally construed so as to rope in family members, other than the legal heirs or representatives of such past officer or employee. Prima facie, we find that there is an apparent conflict between the two http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 decisions of this Court - one in Abhilash Vinodkumar Jain’s case [supra] and the other in J.K.[Bombay] Ltd.’s case [supra], on the interpretation of Section 630 of the Act.  Hence we think it appropriate to refer the matter to a larger bench.","This matter involves interpretation as to the scope of Section 630 of the Companies Act, 1956 [hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’].

Heard Mr.Immanuel, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr.R.Nedumaran, learned counsel for the respondent. We have perused the order impugned in this appeal which reads thus :- ""ORDER This petition coming on for orders upon perusing the petition and the affidavit filed in support thereof and upon hearing the arguments of Mr.A.Immanuel, Advocate for the petitioner, the Court made the following order:- Heard both side. 2       Interim stay is made absolute subject to the condition that the petitioner/appellant deposits 50% of the total tax due to the respondent within a period of eight weeks, failing which the stay granted shall stand automatically vacated."" The matters relates to the sales tax arrears of vendee-appellant. According to the appellant, the sales transaction was completed in the year 2000 and the proceedings were initiated against him by a notice issued by the Addl.Deputy Commercial Tax Officer- III, Tuticorn on 31.07.2002 and an assessment order was passed 06.12.2004 against the assessee M/s.Blesso Construction and P.J. Engineering Constructions fixing the total tax due at Rs.83,53,477/- by way of tax arrears including penalty etc. A Demand Notice was issued to the appellant-assessee R.Balasubramaniam to pay the arrears of tax due since the appellant has purchased the property  and is in possession of the property in S.No.495/1A2, 495/1B2.  It is not in dispute that the appellant has purchased the property in question for Rs.4,90,000/- as could be seen from the sale deed.  According to the appellant, he was a bonafide purchaser. It is also not in dispute that against the dismissal of the Writ Petition filed by the appellant challenging the said assessment, the appellant preferred the Writ Appeal which is pending final disposal before the High Court and during the pendency of the Writ Appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court directed the appellant to deposit 50% of the total tax due to the respondent within a period of eight weeks, failing which the stay granted shall stand automatically vacated. Aggrieved by the said interim order, the appellant preferred the above appeal in this Court and this Court on 28.11.2005 while ordering notice to the respondent ordered attachment of the property purchased by the appellant shall continue and no further steps will be taken until further orders by this Court.  Since there is an order of attachment during the pendency of the Civil Appeal in this Court, the interest of the respondent is fully safeguarded by the said Order.  We, therefore, set aside the order passed by the High Court ordering deposit of 50% of the total tax due and request the High Court to dispose of Writ Appeal filed by the appellant on merits and in accordance with law. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We also make it clear that the attachment order passed by this Court will continue till the disposal of the Writ Appeal.  The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. No costs.","The matters relates to the sales tax arrears of vendee-appellant.

V. Mohan Prasad & Anr. O R D E R The petitioners  pray in  these petitions, among others things, to  recall our  order dated  8.1.1996. They say that the counsel  who appeared for them did not inform the result and the undertaking they were required to give to vacate the premises. They were not served with the dasti service in the contempt proceedings  and, therefore,  they were  unaware of the proceedings that took place in this Court. Consequently, they were  wrongly convicted.  Their special  leave petition against order  or eviction  upheld by  the  High  Court  was dismissed. Time,  at request;  was given  to deliver  vacant possession after  expiry of the time and written undertaking was given.  It is too much to accept such contentions. It is not in dispute that Mrs. Gyan Sudha Misra, counsel appearing on their behalf had filed the SLP. It is not their case that they made  enquiry of  the result of the case in this Court. It would be normal practice, unless contrary is proved, that the counsel  who appeared  for  the  petitioner  duly  would intimate the result of the order passed by this Court. Under these circumstances,  this Court cannot investigate into the fact whether the counsel for the petitioner had communicated the order  or not.  It is  not their  case  that  they  have vacated the  premises after  the SLP came to be dismissed by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 this Court after expiry of given period. The postal service of notice  in  contempt  petition  has  not  been  effected. Consequently, we  directed service by dasti so that personal notice could  be given to the petitioner by the respondents. An affidavit  has been  filed by Mohan Prasad, son of Dwarka Prasad, the  respondent in the SLP and the petitioner in the contempt petition,  wherein he  has stated that he had taken the service  personally to  the- respondent  and  sought  to serve on  them. They  had declined  to receive  the  notice. Thus, service of notice could not be effected through dasti.

" [ With I.A.Nos.4 & 5/97 in C.A.No. 8637/97 arising out of SLP (C) No. 11238/97 ] J U D G M E N T Verma, CJI Leave granted  limited to the question indicated in our order dated 7.7.9 The grievance of the appellants is that our order dated 7.5.97 in  Sanjay Jain  Vs. Anil  Sabharwal & Ors. [ (SLP(C) .../97 ( CC.4325/97 ] has been misconstrued to mean that the legality of  allotment of plots made under the discretionary quota even prior to 31.10.89 has been directed by that order to be  reopened and  examined. It  is submitted  that such a misinterpretation results  from a misconstruction of certain words in that order, namely: ""We are constrained to observe that the    accountability     of    the authorities who are responsible for making these  arbitrary  allotments which have  been rightly  cancelled by  the  High  Court  needs  to  be examined after  their  identity  is fixed in an appropriate proceeding. In addition,  it is  also expedient that any  remaining  allotments  of the kind  which have been cancelled by the  High Court  should also  be treated also be treated alike. This exercise has  not bee  performed by the High  Court in the preset case. It is, therefore, expedient that as a follow  up action, the High Court should  proceed   to  complete  the exercise."" It is  sufficient for  us to  clarify that by the above order dated  7.5.97 this  Court upheld  cancellation of  the allotments  out   of  the  discretionary  quota  made  after 31.10.89  and   it  was  further  said  that  any  remaining allotments of  the same  kind should  be  treated  alike  to complete the  exercise. In  other  words,  our  order  dated 7.5.97 contained  the direction  to treat all allotments out http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the  discretionary quota  made after 31.10.89 without any exception, in  order to  examine the  accountability of  the concerned authorities  as also  to avoid  any discrimination between allotters  subsequent to  31.10.89. That  order was, therefore, concerned  entirely with the allotment made after 31.10.89   and did  not refer to any allotment prior to that date. We  consider it  necessary to  say  so  to  avoid  any possible  misinterpretation  by  this  Court’s  order  dated 7.5.97. We  may,  however,  add  that  the  only  question  for examination  by   this  Court   in  Sanjay   Jain  vs.  Anil Sabharwal’s case being all the allotments made subsequent to 31.10.89,  our   order  is  also  not  to  be  construed  as inhibiting any  separate/independent action  in  respect  of allotments for  any other  period including  period prior to 31.10.89. The appeal is disposed of with this clarification.",7.5.97 in Sanjay Jain Vs. Anil Sabharwal & Ors.

Ram  Jethmalani, A. K. Sen, Harjinder Singh and M. N.  Lodha for the Appellant. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 S.   N.  Kacker, Sol.  General, R. P. Bhatt, Girish  Chandra for the Respondent. The Order of the Court was delivered by FAZAL  ALI,  J.-  In  support of  the  rule  Mr.  Jethmalani submitted  a short point before us.  It was argued that  the representation  filed by the detenu through his counsel  has not  been  considered by the Government at  all.   The  High Court was of the view that the aforesaid representation  was not given by the detenu himself but by Mr. Jethmalani in his capacity as a member of the Parliament.  The  representation has  been placed before us and it clearly recites  that  Mr. Jethmalani  acted not as a member of the Parliament  but  on instructions  from his client, namely, the detenu.   In  the circumstances  therefore,  the High Court was  in  error  in construing  the  representation made by  the  petitioner  as being  mad& not by him but by his counsel.  It  is  manifest that  the  counsel had no personal matter and  he  was  only advocating  the cause of his client.  In matters  where  the liberty 4 02 of the subject is concerned and a highly cherished right  is involved,  the representations made by the detenu should  be construed  liberally and not technically so as to  frustrate or  defeat  the  concept of liberty which  is  engrained  in article  21 of the Constitution.  As the representation  has not  been considered at all by the Government which  it  was duty bound to consider, that by itself vitiates the order of detention.  We, therefore, allow this appeal and direct  the appellant to be released forthwith.  The order of this Court releasing the appellant on parole, passed by us on the  last hearing, is vacated as having become infructuous. S.R. Appeal allowed. 403","Ram  Jethmalani, A. K.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL  APPEAL  NO. 1227  OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(C) No.22369/2005] Delay condoned. Leave granted. The claimants-respondents were travelling as unauthorized passengers in a Matador vehicle which was being rashly and negligently driven by one Chetan Kumar. The contention raised by the Insurance Company is that the said Chetan Kumar did not have any valid licence while driving the said vehicle.  One of the questions which was raised before the learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal was as to whether the deceased and in the injured persons were travelling as passengers or as employees of the owner of the vehicle. It is not in dispute that the insurance policy prescribed that the vehicle may be us ed only for carrying goods within the meaning of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The policy did not cover carriage of the passengers in the vehicle except the employees, other than the driver, not exceeding six in number coming within the purview of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. The Tribunal arrived at a finding that all the persons, who were 14 in number, were travelling in the said vehicle as passengers and not as labourers/employees of the owner of the vehicle.  Despite the same, the Tribunal opined that as the Insurance Company has not been able to discharge the onus of proof that the owner of the vehicle has committed breach of the conditions of the contract of insurance, the claim petition should be allowed. Aggrieved thereby the appellant herein preferred an appeal in terms of Section 173 of the Motor Vehicle Act which has been disposed of directing: ""Thus, we hold that all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount to the appellant and in the event the amount is paid by the  respondent No.3 shall be entitled to recover it from the insured in the same proceedings without initiating any fresh proceeding against the respondent No.2. In the light of the above mentioned decision, which is fully applicable in this case, this appeal is allowed and it is directed that the respondent No.8/National Insurance Co. Ltd. shall make payment to the third party and in the event the amount is paid by the respondent No.8/National Insurance Co. Ltd., it shall be entitled to recover it from the appellant-owner Pradeep Kumar Jain (insured) in the same proceedings without initiating any fresh proceedings against the appellant."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Learned counsel for the appellant would draw our attention to the finding arrived at by the High Court to contend that there was nothing to suggest that, merely in the absence of production of licence or that the vehicle was driven by the driver without lincence, on the basis thereof the impugned direction could not have been issued. We, however, need not go into the aforementioned question as evidently in terms of a decision of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Asha Rani & Ors., [2003 (2) SCC 223], which has been followed by this Court in a large number of decisions, it has been categorically held that a transport vehicle cannot be used for the purpose of carrying passengers. We are, therefore, of the opinion that there is no merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly. Learned counsel for  the appellant states that the awarded amount shall be deposited, within a period of eight weeks, before the Tribunal wherein proceeding for recovery of the awarded amount has been initiated.","Claims-respondents were travelling as unauthorized passengers in a Matador vehicle.

So far as C.A.No.6762 of 2001 is concerned, this appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay holding that in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Ramchandra Goverdhan Pandit vs. Charity Commissioner of State of Gujarat, [AIR 1987 SC 1598], the Letters Patent Appeal filed against the order of the learned Single Judge was not maintainable in law. In our view, Civil Appeal No.6762/2001 has now become infructuous, in view of the fact that the said appeal was filed against the original order of the learned Single Judge in respect of which Civil Appeal No.6761 of 2001 has been filed. Accordingly, this appeal being Civil Appeal No. 6762/2001 having become infructuous is disposed of accordingly. So far as C.A.6761 of 2001 is concerned, we find that the learned Single Judge while dismissing the appeal had not passed any reasoned and speaking order after applying his mind and after considering the available records.

The  said  provision  reads  as follwos:- (4)     Notwithstanding          anything (a)  may,  in addition to discharging the functions  of  the   Judicial   Member   or   the Administrative Member of the Bench to which he is appointed discharge the functions of the Judicial Member or, as the case may be, the Administrative Member, of any other Bench."" In  our  opinion,  the  aforesaid  submission of the learned counsel is not correct.    The  Chairman  may  be  a Judicial Member  or an Administrative Member.  All that this sub-clause permits is that the Chairman can function at more than one Benches.    This  provision  obviously  had  to  be included  in  order  to  enable  the Chairman to function at different places when he goes on tour.  This provision  does not  enable  the Judicial Member to act as an Administrative Member or vice versa.  If the Chairman is a person  who  was an  Administrative  Member, then under Section 5(4)(a) if he goes to another Bench  he  can  sit  on  that  Bench  as  an Administrative  Member,  but  certainly  not  as  a Judicial Member.

" KRISHNA IYER,  J. We  have today disposed of a batch of writ of  petitions arising under the Punjab Excise Act, 1914 (Annexure A).  There  the  petitioner  had  challenged  Sec. 59(f)(v) and  rule 37  as unconstitutional.  In the  present batch of  writ petitions  ’he contention is identical except that the  enactment and  rule are  formally different but in pari materia.  Sec. 41(e)(v) of the U.P. Excise Act empowers the Excise  Commissioner to  make rules  fixing the days and hours during  which licensed  premises may be kept opened or http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 closed. Rule  13 is  one such  rule which  forbids  sale  of liquor ""of  all Tuesdays  as well  as the first day of every month‘’. Aggrieved  by- rule  13 (as  amended),  because  it prohibits liquor  trade  on  the  1st  of  every  month  the petitioners, who  are licensees,  have come up to this Court challenging its vires. Rule 13 reads thus: 162 ""13B. All  excise shops  (including foreign liquor country spirit,  home drugs,  opium (tari  and outstill shops) shall  not be  kept  open  on  Independence  day (August 15)  Mahatma Ghana  Birthday (October 2) and on the day  of Mahatma  Gandhi’s tragic death (January 30) every year  an(l also on all Tuesdays as well as on the first day of every month. Provided that if the first day of the month happen to be  a public holiday, the day next following of that month shall  be the day on which the excise shops shall not be kept open. Provided further Excise Commissioner, may in  consultation with the Collector of the District concerned,  waive  the  condition  of  not  keeping  an exercise shop  open on Tuesday; or the first day of the month or  the day  next following of that month, as the case may  be, for such specified period as he may think fit, in the case of hotels possessing a licence in Form F.L. for  the sale of foreign liquor for the benefit of such foreign  tourists as may hold a valid permit under the All India liquor permit scheme of the Government of India.’ The source  of the  rule-making power  is Sec. 11(c)(v) which hardly needs reproduction. It is  easy to  see that  the provisions  in the Punjab Law, challenged  unsuccessfully before  us, and  these  U.P. provisions are  virtually  the  same.  The  contentions  put forward by  counsel for  the petitioners and the submissions by the  Solicitor General  and shri  O. P. Rana in reply are also identical with what we have heard and considered in the Punjab cases. Indeed, the U.P. cases, from the point of view of the State, are stronger because the licences were awarded at public auctions and all the conditions now objected to in these  writ  petitions  regarding  closure  of  business  on certain days  are printed  in the  auction notice. With full knowledge  of  these  restrictions,  which  they  considered reasonable when  they participated in the bids (and which we consider reasonable  for reasons we have given in the Punjab cases), they  took the  licences. So their present challenge must meet with its Waterloo in the decision of this Court in the Punjab  Cases. Without  more ado,  we dismiss  the  Writ Petitions with costs (one hearing fee). N.V.K.                                   Pettions dismissed. 163","Supreme Court of India dismisses writ petitions challenging Punjab Excise Act, 1914.

S.K. Bisaria and Amicus Curiae for the Appellant. N. Nettar for the Respondent. The order of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD,  C.   J.-Heard  counsel.   Special   leave granted. 1270 It is  true that  both the  Sessions Court and the High Court  have  given  ""special  reasons""  for  imposing  death sentence upon  the appellant.  We have  carefully considered every one  of the special reasons but we are unable to agree that this  is a proper case for imposing the death sentence. We have  held recently  in Bachan  Singh v.  State of Punjab that the  rule that  the normal  sentence for the offence of murder is  life imprisonment  should  be  observed  both  in letter and  in spirit. We had therefore to emphasise in that case that  the death  sentence should  be  imposed  in  very extreme cases. The appellant committed the murder of a young boy which has to  be deprecated  as strongly as one may but it appears that there  was a land dispute between the deceased’s father and certain  other persons,  which led  to the murder of the unfortunate young  boy. The  appellant  is  not  a  habitual criminal, the  circumstances which  led lo the crime are not likely to  recur and  the appellant  has not  committed  the crime for  any personal  gain. On  the whole  we are  of the opinion that  the ends  of justice will be met by sentencing 1) the appellant to suffer imprisonment for life. We do  hope that  even if the validity of section 433 A of the  Criminal Procedure Code Is upheld by this Court, the Government will  not, save  for weighty  reasons, reduce  or commute the  sentence of the appellant to less than fourteen years,  since  unquestionably,  he  has  committed]  a  very serious crime. Accordingly, we  set aside  the death  sentence imposed upon the  appellant and instead, impose the sentence of life imprisonment on  him With  this modification  the appeal  is dismissed. N.V.K.

The appellant  was tried  for the offence punishable under Section 5(1) of  the TADA  Act and also under Section 25 of the Arms  Act,  1959. The  Designated Court convicted him under Section 25 of  the Arms Act only and sentenced him to undergo six months’ RI. 153 2.   The prosecution case is that on October 18, 1986,  Hari Chand PW 2 accosted the appellant and recovered from him  an unlicensed firearm.  The panchnama was prepared and  charge- sheet was lodged. 3.   In statement under Section 313 CrPC the accused  denied the  offence  and  pleaded not guilty.  In  his  defence  he examined DW 1 who deposed that the recovery was effected  at the  instance of one Khazan Chand but he also admitted  that appellant  and three others were summoned by the police  and they  were required to produce the proof of their  innocence and  that  the illicit arms did not belong  to  them.   This defence  is  held to be an afterthought and  the  Designated Court has given ample reasons for rejecting the same. 4.   The  only  other  submission  put  forward  before  the Designated  Court  is that the official witnesses  were  all interested  and  the  case has been foisted.   There  is  no presumption  that  the evidence of  the  official  witnesses cannot be relied upon. 5.   By the Amendment Act 39 of 1985 the minimum sentence of one year is prescribed for unlawful possession of a  firearm without a licence.  In the instant case, as provided in  the proviso,  the  Designated Court has  given  special  reasons though not very satisfactory and awarded six months’ RI.  We see  no  ground  to  interfere.

" J U D G M E N T B.P.Singh,J. We have heard counsel for the parties. The respondent Jora Ram along with Mohan Ram and Durga Ram was put up for trial charged of the offences under Sections 302, 324 and 323 read with 34 I.P.C.   The trial court by its judgment and order of 2nd December, 1997 found the respondent as well as the other accused guilty of the offences under Sections 302,  324  and 323 read with 34 I.P.C.    They were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment under Section 302 read with 34 I.P.C., one year’s rigorous imprisonment under Section 324/34 I.P.C. and 6 months rigorous imprisonment under Section 323/34 I.P.C., apart from fines imposed. On appeal preferred by the accused, the High Court by its impugned judgment of 11th November, 1998 partly allowed the appeal inasmuch as Mohan Ram and Durga Ram were acquitted of the charges levelled against them.   The respondent herein was found guilty of the offence punishable under Section 304 Part II I.P.C. and since he had already served out the sentence of 5 years and 10 months, he was sentenced to the period already undergone. The State of Rajasthan preferred petition for special leave  before this Court against the judgment and order of the High Court but this Court by its order dated 27th September, 1999 confined the appeal only as against the respondent herein, namely, Jora Ram.   The acquittal of the remaining two accused has, therefore, attained finality and we are only concerned with the case of the respondent Jora Ram. The High Court came to the conclusion that the prosecution had not been able to prove the involvement of Mohan Ram and Durga Ram, co-accused and, therefore, they were entitled to the benefit of doubt.   It appears from the findings recorded by the High Court that the participation of two others was not dis-believed but it was doubtful whether Mohan Ram and Durga Ram were the other two participants.   The case of the prosecution was that the respondent who was armed with a knife had caused injuries on the person of the deceased.   The High Court found that the medical evidence on record did not make out a case of murder.   The medical evidence on record discloses that the injuries found on the person of the deceased were simple injuries and none of them was described as grievous. There is no evidence to prove that the injuries inflicted on the deceased were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.   There was a bruise  on the front  of the nec k of the deceased and the medical evidence disclosed that there was bleeding of the trachea as a result of that injury, and the bleeding resulted in clotting of the blood in the trachea leading to Asphyxia.   This injury was not attributed to the respondent, and there was nothing to establish that the injury which ultimately resulted in the death of the deceased was intended by any one.  In these circumstances, the High Court held that the offence under Section 302 IPC was not made out and that the offence made out was one punishable under Section 304 Part II I.P.C. We find no reason to take a different view.   The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.","Jora Ram along with Mohan Ram and Durga Ram was put up for trial charged of the offences under Sections 302, 324 and 323 read with 34 I.P.C.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur Bench dismissing the appeal filed by the appellants. 2.      Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Respondent filed a suit for specific performance of the contract of employment.  According to the appellants, his lands were acquired for the purpose of construction of quarters for the employees. 2.      Sale-deed was executed in respect of the land and there was specific provision in a preceding agreement that four persons were to be given employment.  Allegation was that only three had been provided employment and in spite of assurance the defendants did not give the job to the plaintiffs. 3.      Stand of the defendants was that the suit was not maintainable. In fact, four persons have been given employment.  The Trial Court and the First Appellate Court accepted the position that three persons had been given jobs but held that no job was provided to the appellant.  The Trial Court noticed that even though it was contended by the present appellants that one son of the plaintiff had been given a job, no document in that regard had been filed.  The First Appellate Court and the High Court were of the same view. 4.      The High Court held that the stand of the appellant that in view of Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, suit for specific performance is not maintainable and is subject to certain exceptions.  It was held that since there was a solemn promise to employ four persons the appellants should not be permitted to wriggle out the promise by taking the plea that Section 14 of the Act bars a suit of the nature filed. 5.      By order dated March 31, 2000, this Court had permitted the appellants to file documents to show that the son of the respondent no.1 had been given appointment on his nomination. The same has been filed. Though this document was not part of the records of the Courts below, but other evidence was available to show that, in fact, son of respondent no.1 named \023Guntoo\024 was appointed at the request of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 respondent no.1. The document placed on record by the appellant pursuant to the order of this Court also clearly establishes this fact. 6.      In that view of the matter the suit filed by respondent no.1 deserves to be dismissed and the orders of the Trial Court, First Appellate Court and the High Court in the Second Appeal deserve to be set aside which we direct. 7.      The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.  No costs.",The appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur Bench dismissing the appeal filed by the appellants.

" J U D G M E N T HANSARIA,J. The  appellant   joined  the   Prohibition  and  Excise Department as  a  Constable  in  the  year  1961.  The  next promotional post  is that  of Sub-Inspector.  He was  indeed interviewed for  that post  in the  year 1966,  but was  not promoted on  the ground  that his chest measurement was less than the  standard said to be  required to hold the post. He ultimately came  to be  promoted as a Sub-Inspector in 1970. His grievance,  is however,  is that  the promotion  has  to relate back  to 1966  inasmuch as his rejection in that year for the  promotional post  on the ground above noted was not tenable for  two reasons  : (1) there is no such requirement as would  appear, inter  alia,  from  the  decision  of  the Maharashtra Administrative  Tribunal itself  in the  case of one Shashikant Dhaku Chavan rendered in Transfer Application No.278 of  1991 on  27.8.1993, whereas  his approach  to the Tribunal was  dismissed by  an order  dated 15.6.1993 on the ground of his having not fulfilled the physical requirement; and (2)  the Government  had allowed  S/Shri S.H.  Avhad and S.K. Throat  to hold  the promotional  post though they were below height. 2.   We find  merit in  both the  grievances inasmuch as the rule relating  to physical requirement has no application in the case of Sub-Inspectors as would appear from the judgment of the  tribunal in the case of Chavan. Chavan’s case cannot be distinguished  on the ground that he belonged to clerical branch whereas  the appellant was in constabulary, as sought to be done by the learned counsel for the State, inasmuch as Rule 3  noted by  the Tribunal  in  Chavan’s  case  has  not mentioned about  physical requirement  as qualification  for Sub Inspectors.  This apart,  the Government  having allowed the aforesaid  two persons  to hold  the promotional of Sub- Inspector despite their being below the required height, the same benefit  has to  be made  available to the appellant as http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the short-fall  of  physical  requirement  in  his  case  is relatable to the chest being not of required measurement. 3.   The appeal is, therefore, allowed and we state that the promotion of  the appellant  to the  post  of  Sub-Inspector shall be  deemed to  be from  the date  of rejection  of his promotion in the year 1986. This notional promotion shall be confined to the benefit of seniority alone as was the prayer of the  appellant in  the writ  petition filed by him before the High  Court, which  had come  to be  transferred to  the Tribunal for disposal. No order as to costs.","The appeal is, therefore, allowed and we state that the promotion of  the appellant  to the  post  of  Sub-Inspector shall be deemed to be from the date  of rejection of his promotion in the year 1986.

" JUDGMENT ORDER The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla in Civil Review No. 9 of 1998. By the impugned order, the earlier order passed in Civil Writ Petition No. 1844 of 1995 was recalled and it was held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. This view was taken primarily on the ground that the respondent was a Cooperative Society and was, therefore, not covered within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short ‘the Constitution’). Reliance for this purpose was placed on two Division Bench judgments of the High Court holding that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. As noted above, the review was allowed and the writ petition was dismissed as being not maintainable. No view was expressed on the merits of the case. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted with reference to a seven Judges Bench judgment of this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology and Ors., [2002] 5 SCC 111 that the writ petition is maintainable. By the said judgment, the decision of the Constitution Bench in the case of Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of India and Ors., [1975] 1 SCC 485 was overruled. The Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Ajay Hasia and Ors. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi and Ors., [1981] 1 SCC 722 was explained and multiple tests for determining whether a particular Corporation or Body can be held to be included within the definition of ‘‘State’’ under Article 12 of the Constitution, were laid down. It was inter-alia held as follows: ‘‘The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests formulated in Ajay Hasia’s case (supra) are not a rigid set of principles so that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex hypothesi, be considered to be a State within the meaning of Article 12. The question in each case would be - whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally and administratively dominated by or under the control of the Government. Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the body is a State within Article 12. On the other hand, when the control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body a State.’’ It appears that the basic factual aspects were not placed before the High Court to determine the question whether the respondent-Society was ‘‘State’’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. In view of the aforesaid, we feel it would be appropriate for the High Court to examine the question regarding the maintainability in the background of what has been stated in Pradeep Kumar’s case (supra). The parties shall be permitted to place materials in support of their respective stands in this http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 regard. As the matter is pending since 1995 and involves the question of legality or otherwise of termination of services of the appellant, it would be in the interest of the parties if the writ petition is disposed of as early as practicable preferably within four months from the date of receipt of our order. In the ultimate result, Civil Writ Petition No. 1844 of 1995 is restored to file. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. The High Court shall decide the question of maintainability of the writ petition as well as the merits. In case, it holds that it has jurisdiction, then it shall consider the merits by taking into account the materials to be placed before it by the parties in respect of their respective stand. The appeal is disposed of accordingly without any order as to costs.","The appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla in Civil Review No. 9 of 1998.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.5691 OF 2002 This appeal filed by the State is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.08.2001 passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court. Heard the parties. The respondent herein was appointed on ad hoc basis on the post of Stenographer for a period of three months.   The time was extended twice and ultimately, the respondent also appeared in the test but failed.  The respondent preferred writ petition before the learned Single Judge. The same was disposed by the learned Single Judge allowing the respondent to continue till the regularly selected Stenographer joins the post. The same was confirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court. : 2 : While issuing notice on 15.10.2001 this Court stayed both the orders of the Division Bench and the learned Single Judge. In view of the interim order, the respondent is no more in service today. Even otherwise an ad hoc appointee appointed for a period of three months as Stenographer, whose term is further extended, should not be allowed to continue in the public interest when he failed in the test. It may be mentioned that there is no principle of law that a person appointed in a temporary capacity has a right to continue till a regular selection  Rather, the legal position is just the reverse, that is, that a temporary employee has no right to the post vide State of U.P. v. Kaushal Kishore, (1991) 1 SCC 691. Hence, he has no right to continue even for a day as of right, far from having a right to continue till a regular appointment. On this sole ground we set aside both the orders of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court. This appeal is allowed. No costs. Before parting with this case we would like to mention that very often selection and appointments are made on posts requiring special skills like that of a stenographer.  On such posts the only criterion should be merit.  However, very often such appointments are not made on merit but on some recommendations, and such appointees are very often incompetent. : 3 : If an incompetent stenographer is appointed for the Court the result will be that the correct order passed by the Judge will not be recorded, and this will create many problems.  Much of the time of the Judge will be spent on making corrections. Hence great care must be taken by the selection committee for selecting persons to be appointed on posts requiring special skills like that of a stenographer purely on merit disregarding any recommendation made by anyone, howsoever high.","The appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.08.2001 passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court.

" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 105 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. It is contended for the appellants that as per the directions, issued by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 1173/62, dated March 4, 1965, the High. Court had struct down the rules holding that there cannot be any distinction between the Talatis and Village Accountants. They cannot be clubbed together and they constitute different categories and that, there- fore, they are entitled to separate scales of pay. When they claimed the scale of pay on the basis of revised pay scales at Rs. 90-200 instead of Rs, 80-145, the Tribunal has committed illegality in not considering the distinction and that therefore, the appellants are not entitled to the benefit of the payment of scale of pay of Rs, 90-200 as per 1970 Rules w.e.f. January 1, 1970. It would appear that the Government made a distinction between Talatis and Village Accountants who possessed SSLC qualification and those who are non- SSLC candidates. For the candidates who are having SSLC qualification, pay scale of Rs. 90-200 has been provided for. Admittedly, the appellants are not in that category as they are non-SSLC candidates. The Government, therefore, thought it expedient to make a distinction between qualified and unqualified persons and prescribed different scales of pay. Hence, we do not find any invidious discrimination made between the two categories to club together and grant them same scale of pay of Rs, 90-200. However, since the appellants have already been paid the scale of pay of Rs. 90-200 while they were in service and are retired now, it would be appropriate that the Government may not recover from Diem the salary which they had already received though they are not to the scale of pay of Rs. 90-200. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. No Costs.","It is contended for the appellants that as per the directions, issued by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 1173/62, dated March 4, 1965, the High.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the order of the learned  single judge  made on August 2, 1996 in CRP No. 476/96. The admitted  position is that the respondent had filed the suit  for settlement  of accounts  on  the  basis  of  a contract dated  may  12,1983.  He  also  sought  for  decree jointly and  severally against  the defendants  2  to  4  or against their  estate for  the amount due; for a declaration that the  respondent is entitled to recover all the loss the damages form  defendants and  their assets when the same was ascertained, as  been filed  on February 15,1995 under Order VI, Rule  17, CPC for amendment of the plaint for converting the suit  into one  for damages  quantifying the  damages as stated  in   para  8A.   The  trial   Court  dismissed   the application. In  the revision,  the High  Court allowed  it. Thus, this special leave petition. It is  contended for  the petitioner that a suit merely for  settlement   of  accounts   and  declaration  that  the respondent is entitled to recover damages form the defendant cannot be  converted into  a suit  for damages in particular after the right of recovery is barred by limitation, i.e., a valuable right  had accrued  to the  petitioners.  The  High Court, therefore, is not right in granting the amendment. We find no  force in  the contention.  It is  seen that what is sought to  be amended  is paragraph  8A and  the suit  is to recover the  quantified amount  as damages  based  upon  the original cause  of action,  namely, the contract referred to hereinbefore. It  is seen  that the  original suit  was  for settlement of accounts and fastening a liability jointly and severally against  all the  defendants and  the  assets  and estates. The  relief  originally  sought  for  also  was  to declare the  liability of  the damages to be ascertained and recoverable from  them. Thus,  it could  be seen that as per the original  cause of action, the relief now sought for was available in  the suit  itself.  Instead  of  settlement  of account, the  respondent is  now seeking for damages against the respondent  and the damages instead of being ascertained were quantifies in paragraph 8A of the plaint. The amendment does not constitute addition of any new cause of action. The http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 respondent is not introducing any new cause of action nor it would change  the cause  of action  as  originally  pleaded. Thus, there  is  neither  change  of  cause  of  action  nor introduction of  any new  cause of  action after  the bar of limitation. The High Court was, therefore, right in allowing the petition for amendment of the plaint. The special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.","The petition was filed on February 15,1995 under Order VI, Rule 17, CPC for amendment of the plaint.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for both the parties.

It would thus be clear that, in spite of any matter having become final or matter pending by operation of  Section 32-A  and 32-8,  all  the  proceedings stand abated.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard the  learned counsel  for the appellants and the respondent-in-person. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order passed by  the Tribunal  in Contempt Petition No. 35/1996 in pending O.A.  No. 1156/94.  The Tribunal  had issued interim directions that  ""(I)n the  circumstances, we  hereby direct the respondents  as  an  interim  measure  to  consider  the applicant to  the Senior  Scale  and  Junior  Administrative Grade according  to the  Rules within a period of two months from the  date of  receipt of  the order.

It is stated by the appellants that they have  considered the case on June 7, 1996 and found him not fit  to the  said Senior  Time  Scale.  Thereafter,  the respondent filed  contempt petition  in the Tribunal and the Tribunal has  passed the  impugned order  relevant  part  of which is as under: ""...the  State   Government  should also consider  the fitness  of  the applicant for being promoted to the Junior Administrative Grade from an appropriate date  strictly  as  per rules within  two months  from  the date of  the communication  of this order.

Though the  learned counsel  for the appellants as well as respondent-in-person seek to raise contentions on merits, we think  that this is not an appropriate stage for us to go http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 into the merits in the matter. In view of the stand taken by the  appellants   that  the   case  of  the  respondent  was considered by  the Government  and found  that  he  was  not eligible for  grant of Senior Time Scale, as directed by the Tribunal, the appropriate course should be that the Tribunal may decide  matter on merits and then deal with it according to law.  Instead, unfortunately,  the Tribunal  has exceeded its power  in giving  the directions, even before the matter was considered  on merits.

" J U D G M E N T S.B. Majmudar, J. Leave granted. We have  heard learned  counsel for the parties finally in this appeal. The  short   question  is   whether  the   Commissioner exercising powers  under the  proviso to  Section 11  of the Land Acquisition  Act, 1984  (’the Act’  for  short),  while granting approval  to the  proposal of  the Land Acquisition Collector  regarding   the  award  of  compensation  to  the claimants could  reduce the  suggested amount  for different categories of lands sought to be acquired. The High  Court relying  upon its  earlier decision has taken a view that the Commissioner has no such power.  It is true that  the proviso to Section 11 lays down that no award shall   be made  by the  Collector under  sub-section (1) of Section 11  of the  Act without the previous approval of the appropriate Government or of such officer as the appropriate Government may  authorise in  his behalf  and acting  on the said proviso  the state of Bihar by notification dated March 13, 1995  had authorised the Commissioner of the Division in such class  of cases  where the  total compensation  exceeds Rupees Five Lacs but does not exceed Rupees Fifteen Lacs, to be the  authority under  the proviso to Section 11(1) of the act. The  High Court’s  decision cannot be sustained for the simple reason that the view which appealed to the High Court relying upon  its earlier  decision has  been upset  by this Court in  its decision  dated 30th November 1993 rendered in Civil Appeal  arising out  of S.L.P.  (C) No.  7873 of 1993. Following the  said  decision  it  must  be  held  that  the Commissioner could have exercised powers under Section 11(1) of the Land Acquisition Act. However, that  would not  be the  end  of  the  matter. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that according to him,  as the  lands acquired  in  this  case  were  about Ac.1.15 gunths,  the total  award offered  by the  Collector would not  be Rs. 5 lacs but would be much less.  Therefore, even assuming  that the Commissioner had authority to decide the question  under the  proviso to Section 11(1), if he was not the  competent authority  he could  not have reduced the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 amount  of   compensation.     Mr.  Singh,  learned  counsel appearing for  the  State  of  Bihar,  on  the  other  hand, submitted  that   the  award   under  Section   11(1)  is  a comprehensive award  and, therefore,  if number of pieces of lands are acquired by the same notification, the award would be  a  composite  one  awarding  compensation  to  different claimants.   And if the total amount of compensation offered in such an award exceeds Rs.5 lacs, it would fall within the powers of  the authority  entrusted  with  the  function  of approval under  the proviso  to Section  11(1) of  the  Act. Learned counsel  for the  respondents, on  the  other  hand, submitted that  if that  was so,  then question  wold  arise whether the  total compensation computed by the Collector as payable to all the claimants together would work out to more than Rs.15  lacs in which case the Commissioner would not be the competent  authority to  act under  proviso  to  Section 11(1) of the Act but it would be the State Government as the award would  exceed Rs.  15 lacs,   As these aspects are not dealt with  by the  High Court, we deem it fit and proper to set aside  the order under appeal and remand the proceedings by restoring the writ petition on the file of the High Court with a  request to  proceed further  in accordance  with law after hearing  the parties concerned.  We make it clear that we are  not expressing  any opinion  on the  merits  of  the controversies raised before us on this aspect and it will be for the  High Court  to decide  the same  on its  own in the light of  the relevant evidence which may be produced before it.  The appeal is allowed accordingly.   No costs.","The question is whether the Commissioner exercising powers under the proviso to the Land Acquisition Act, 1984, could reduce the suggested amount for different categories of lands sought to be acquired.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.16991 of 2005) MARKANDEY KATJU, J. Leave granted. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench) dated 12.4.2005 in Writ Petition No.455 of 2004. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The petitioner has prayed for quashing the award dated 4.2.2003 published by the Special Land Acquisition Officer in respect of Renapur Medium Project at village Talegaon (Ghat).  The High Court had dismissed the writ petition and hence this appeal. The short point before us is whether the award was illegal in view of Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""). The date of last publication of the notification under Section 4 of the Act was 18.2.1999 (in Gazette).  The last publication of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act was 28.2.2000 whereas the award was published on 4.2.2003.  According to the learned counsel for the appellant the award ought to have been published on or before 28.2.2000 which was the date of the last declaration under Section 6 of the Act.  Learned counsel has invited our attention to Section 11A of the Act which states : ""11A. The collector shall make an award under Section 11 within a period of two years from the publication of the declaration and if no award is made within that period, the entire proceedings for the acquisition of the land shall lapse."" In our opinion the submission of learned counsel for the appellant is clearly correct in view of the clear provision of Section 11A of the Act.  In view of Section 11A an award has to be made within two years from the date of publication of the declaration under Section 6.  Failure to adhere to this time frame is fatal to the award, as the provision is mandatory. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that after the declaration under Section 6 of the Act dated 28.2.2000 the acquiring http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 body had intimated to the Land Acquisition Officer vide its communication dated 2.1.2001 proposing deletion of some of the area which was proposed to be acquired.  The original declaration under Section 6 was regarding acquisition of 155.26 hectares, but thereafter 107.99 hectares was proposed to be deleted.  Hence the final area which was proposed to be acquired was to the extent of 36.8 hectares. Accordingly, a corrigendum to that effect was issued on 25.1.2003, and hence, it is submitted that the award dated 4.1.2003 was well within time.  We do not agree. In our opinion under Section 11A what has to be seen is the date of last publication of the declaration under Section 6, and not any subsequent corrigendum to the said declaration.  The only circumstance under which the period between the declaration under Section 6 and the award can be extended is mentioned in the explanation to Section 11A which states : ""In computing the period of two years referred to in Section 11A, the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration is stayed by an order of a Court is excluded."" There is no mention in Section 11A that the period after the publication of the declaration under Section 6 and the publication of any corrigendum to the said declaration has also to be excluded.  We will be adding words to the statute if we put such interpretation to Section 11A, and it is well settled the Court should not add or delete words in a statute. In view of the above reasons this appeal is allowed.  The impugned award is quashed.  The impugned judgment is set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.",The appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench) dated 12.4.2005 in Writ Petition No.455 of 2004.

" J U D G M E N T K. Venkataswami. J. Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties. Aggrieved by  the order  of the  Central Administrative Tribunal  (hereinafter  called  the  ""Tribunal""),  Allahabad Bench, dated January 8, 1996 in O.A.No. 1361/95. the present appeal is filed. In the  view we propose to take, it is not necessary to set out  in detail  the facts  leading to  the filing of the said O.A. before the Tribunal. The appellant union moved the Tribunal for regularising the services  of its  members, on  the ground that they have been engaged  as contract  labourers for several years doing the job  of parcel porters at Agra Fort (Railway Station) in the  light  of  the  judgment  of  this  Court  in  National Federation of Railway porters, Vendors and Bearers vs. Union of India & ors. (1995 (supp) 3 SCC 152. According to  the appellant,  the said judgment of this Court was  rendered more or less in identical circumstances. The Tribunal,  unfortunately,  instead  of  going  into  the matter and  deciding the issue raised before it, declined to entertain the  O.A. on  the ground  that the  union  has  an alternative remedy available to it. The question  that was to be decided by the Tribunal in the  light  of  the  judgment  of  this  Court  in  National Federation of Railway Porters’ case (supra) was which is the ’appropriate  Government’   to  decide   the   question   of regularisation of  the workers  to apply  the principle laid down  by  this  Court  in  National  Federation  of  Railway Porters, Vendors  and Bearers vs. Union of India & ors. 1995 (Supp) 3  SCC 152.  In the  facts and  circumstances of this Case and  having regard  to the  fact that  the interests of labourers  are   involved,  we  think  it  would  have  been appropriate for  the Tribunal  to decide the question itself instead of  directing the  union to  avail  the  alternative remedy. Accordingly, we  set aside the order of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 1361/95  and direct  it to  decide the  issue itself  on merits   in the  light of  the principles  laid down by this http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court in  the judgment  in National  Federation  of  Railway Porters, Vendors  and Bearers vs. Union of India & Ors. 1995 (Supp) 3 SCC 152. The parties are at liberty to raise all the contentions available to  them in law before the Tribunal. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","Union moved the Tribunal for regularising the services of its members, on the ground that they have been engaged as contract labourers for several years.

" D E R The only question which  has  been  raised  in  this appeal  pertains  to the award of interest by the Arbitrator for the pre-reference period.  The pre-refcrence period,  in the present  case,  is  from  31.3.1977  to 20.3.1980.  This entire period is prior to coining into force of the interest Act, 1978.  The interest Act, 1978 came  into  force  during the  pendency  of  the  reference  and  the award is made on 12.10.1982 when the Interest Act, 1978 was in force. The short question  is  whether  the  Arbitrator  in 1982,  could  have  awarded  interest  for the pre-reference period in view of the provisions of the Interest Act,  1978, although  the  entire  pre-reference  period is prior to the coming into force of the Interest Act, 1978. In this connection, our attention has been drawn  to the   decision   of  this  Court  in  State  of  Orissa  vs. B.N.Agarwalla reported in (1997) 2 SCO 469.    In  paragraph 18,  this  Court  has held that interest cannot be given for the period prior to the coming into force  of  the  Interest Act, 1973.    This  Court has also held that the decision in the case of Executive Engineer (Irrigation)  vs.    Abhaduta Jena reported in (1938) 1 SCO 418 has not been over-ruled in so  far  as  it  deals  with  interest for the pre-reference period.  This Court has upheld the view  taken  in  Abhaduta Jena’s  case  to the effect that in respect of pre-reference period, interest cannot be awarded in respect of the  period not covered  by  the  Interest Act, 1978.  Our attention was also drawn to a decision in the case of State of Orissa  vs. Niranian  Swain reported in (1989) 4 SCC 269 where also this Court said that where  reference  to  arbitration  was  made prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Interest  Act,  1978, Arbitrator is not empowered to grant interest for the period upto the date of submission of claim to arbitration. In this connection, we would also like to  refer  to Section  6(2)  of  the  Interest Act, 1978 which provides as follows: Section                 6(1) ................. Section 6(2?  :  The  provisions  of  this Act  shall  not apply to any suit or other legal   proceeding    pending    at    the commencement   of   this   Act   and   the provisions  of   the   corresponding   law http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 applicable    immediately    before   such commencement  shall  notwithstanding   the repeal  of  such  law  by sub-section (1), continue to apply to such  suit  or  other legal proceeding. This   section   also   clearly  provides  that  the provisions of the Interest Act, 1978 shall not apply to  any legal  proceeding  pending  at  the commencement of the said Act.  Since the definition of  ""Court""  under  Section  2(a) includes  a  Tribunal  or Arbitrator, the proceedings before the Arbitrator would also be covered by the expression legal proceedings in Section 6(2).  Therefore interest  Act,  1978 does not apply to pending arbitration proceedings. In  the  premises, the present appeal is allowed and the award of interest for the pre-reference period,  namely, 31.3.1977 to  20.3.1.980  is  disallowed.  The award and the decree are modified accordingly to this effect,","The award is made on 12.10.1982 when the Interest Act, 1978 was in force. The entire pre-reference period is prior to coining into force of the interest Act. The present appeal is allowed and the award of interest is disallowed.",appointment,22.65
" O R D E R We have  perused the  order of  the  High  Court  dated November 24,  1975. The  only question raised relates to the validity of  the Ordinance  which has already been upheld by the Full  Bench of  that Court.  It was  argued relating  to legislative competency.  Since it  is a  matter relating  to land reform  and land, it is covered by Schedule 7, List II, item Nos.14  and 18. As a result, the impugned Act is within the legislative  competence of  the State legislature. It is then contended  that it  is violative  of Art.14. We find no force in  the contention. Since the legislature is competent to enact  the law,  all the  agricultural  holdings  covered under the  Act are  equally regulated thereunder. Therefore, there is  no discrimination  violating Art.14.  It  is  next urged that  the procedure  prescribed is in violation of the Code of  Civil Procedure, a Central Act. We find no force in the  contention.  The  procedure  is  only  supplemental  or residual to  the main  purpose of  the Act.  CPC is  in  the Concurrent List.  The Act  received assent of the President. The  legislature,   therefore,  is   competent  to   provide procedure in  the implementation  of the  provisions of  the Act. Next  submission is  that the  trial provided under the Act is  unjust, unreasonable  and unfair.  We find  that the summary procedure  having been prescribed for early disposal of  these   cases,  causes   minimum  inconvenience  to  the litigants,  which   is  just  and  fair  procedure.  It  is, therefore, reasonable  and fair  to the  parties.  Elaborate procedure like  trial need not necessarily be provided as is in vogue  in civil  suits. The  time consuming  process  was sought to  be curtailed  and fair procedure was streamlined. As one  of its  facets it  is argued  that the Letter Patent Appeal was  taken away under the Act and that, therefore, it offends the  right to  fair hearing  and the CPC. We find no force in  the contention.  Creation of  the hierarchy of the court is  one of  legislative policy. With a view to curtail multiplicity of  appeals, the  legislature  stepped  in  and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 saved structural appeals. The legislature limited the remedy by providing  for only one appeal to the High Court before a learned single  Judge against  the orders  of the  Board  of Revenue or  consolidation authority etc. Since that question was  fully  canvassed  before  the  Full  Bench,  which  has considered the same in extension and upheld the abolition of the special  appeal, we  are in agreement with the reasoning and conclusion of the Full Bench. We do  not find any justification for interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The only question raised relates to the validity of the Ordinance which has already been upheld by the Full  Bench of that Court.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.113  OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.3444/2007) Heard learned counsel for appellant and learned counsel for the State. Leave granted. The appellant was convicted for the offence of murder for causing the death of Somari.  The prosecution case was that the appellant had gone to his uncle’s house.  The deceased Somari was also there.  When they were talking each other, the appellant addressed the deceased as ’Dian’ (hag) to which the deceased objected.  The appellant became upset, took a stick and hit her on the head.   The deceased fell down and died. Learned counsel for the appellant made a plea that the offence does not fall under Section 302 IPC.  There was no previous enmity or other motive to cause the death of the deceased.  From  the evidence, it is clear that the incident -2- happened all of a sudden without pre-mediation and the appellant did not take undue advantage of the situation nor acted in a cruel manner.  The offence will, therefore, fall under Section 304 Part I of IPC. We, therefore, set aside the conviction under Section 302 IPC and instead the appellant is convicted under Section 304 Part I IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for  a period of eight years.  We are informed that the appellant has already undergone sentence of more than seven years.  If the appellant has already undergone sentence for the said period, the appellant shall be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

" JUDGMENT DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Heard learned counsel for the State of Bihar (now Jharkhand) and its functionaries. 2. None appears on behalf of the respondents. 3. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in First Appeal No.431 of 1968. The basic issue involved in the appeal was whether the suit premises was used as an office or kutchery for collection of rent. We find that upto paragraph 25, the Division Bench noted the contentions of the parties and the evidence of the witnesses examined by them. In paragraph-26, the reliability of witnesses examined by the State of Bihar (now Jharkhand) and its functionaries was examined and it was held that they were reliable witnesses. After that, the confusion in the judgment starts. In paragraphs 27 to 29, it has been noted as follows: ""27. On proper analysis of the aforesaid oral evidence of the parties, I come to conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove that Raja Bunglow was being used only for residential purpose of Raja at the time of vesting and it was unconnected with either office of Zamindari Kutchery, whereas on the other hand, the contesting defendant was able to prove that the said Bungalow i.e. the suit premises was being used as office-cum-kutchery connected with collection of rent of the Ramgarh Estate. 28. I, therefore, set aside the trial Court's finding that the suit premises was not primarily an office or kutchery for collection of rent. 29. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed, but without costs."" 4. A conjoint reading of paragraphs 27 and 28 makes the position clear that the High Court held that the Trial Court's finding that the suit premises was not primarily an office or kutchery for collection of rent, cannot be maintained. Accordingly, in paragraph-28, the Trial Court's finding was set aside. If that be so, the only conclusion that could have been arrived at was to allow the appeal. Strangely, the High Court dismissed the appeal, without costs. 5. The conclusions and the findings do not go together. The High Courts' findings at paragraphs 27 and 28 are clearly to the effect that the Suit premises was used as an office or Kutchery for collection of rent. In the circumstances, we set aside the conclusion of the High Court about the appeal being without merit. As a consequence, the plaintiff's Suit stands dismissed. The appeal deserves to be allowed in terms of the findings recorded at paragraphs 27 and 28 of the impugned judgment which we direct.",Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in First Appeal No.431 of 1968.

" O R D E R Though notice  was served on the contesting respondent, he is not appearing either in person or through counsel. Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel for the appellant. The admitted  position is  that for  appointment to the post  of   Deputy  Medical   Superintendent,   qualification prescribed is  of post  graduation in Medicine and 15 years’ experience. Admittedly,  the respondent  did not  possess 15 years’ experience.  He had  only 14  years’ experience.  The Tribunal in  the impugned  order dated  October 24,  1996 in O.A. No.  954/97 has  held that  the condition  of 15  years experience is  vague  and,  therefore,  the  respondent  was wrongly excluded  from the  zone  of  consideration  without calling for  the  interview.  Since  the  selection  without calling for  the interview.  Since the selection had already taken place,  the Tribunal  has granted  exemplary costs and compensation to  the respondent.  We find that the procedure adopted by  the Tribunal is wholly and unwarranted. The only question the  Tribunal was  required to consider was whether the respondent  fulfilled the  qualifications prescribed for the post.  In view  of the  admitted position that 15 years’ experience is  one of  the qualifications  for selection and since  the   respondent  did   not  possess  the  same,  the respondent  was   rightly  not  called  for  interview.  the Tribunal, therefore,  not  justified  in  holding  that  the respondent was  wrongfully excluded  from being  called  for interview for  selection. It  is  not  a  case  of  wrongful rejection, but  of rejection  in accordance  with the rules. Even otherwise  also,  the  Tribunal  could  not  award  any damages as  it is beyond its jurisdiction to grant relief by way of damages.

" O R D E R Though the  learned  counsel  has  tried  his  best  to persuade us  to disagree  with the  impugned  order  of  the Court, we  think  that  the  High  Court  is  right  in  its conclusion that  the petitioner is not entitled to the equal pay as  Pumpset Operator. The learned counsel sought to rely upon section  18 of  the Punjab  Town Improvement Trust Act, 1923 (for  short the Act). Section 18 envisages power of the Trust to  fix  number  of  employees,  their  salaries  etc. Section 17  envisages constitution  of the trust and subject to the  constitution section 18 says that the Trust may from time to  time employ  such other  servants on such terms and conditions as it may deem, necessary and proper for carrying out  its  functions  under  the  Act.  Sub-section(2)  gives controlling  power   of  appointment,   promotion,  granting leave,  suspension  of  the  servants,  reducing  them  into their hierarchy  of position  removing  them  from  service, dismissing them  from service  for  misconduct  for  reasons other than  misconduct Chairman  also has  power  under  the Act. It  is  stated  that  in  exercising  this  power,  the Chairman being  the controlling  authority had  releaxed the service conditions  of the  petitioner  and  also  appointed him as  Pumpset Operator  though he  was  not  possessed  of the minimum  qualification prescribed  under the  Act. It is not in  dispute that  for the  said post  Matriculation with I.T.I. are  qualifications which  the petitioner  admittedly has not  possessed of.  General  power  of  supervision  and control does  not include the power to appoint any person of his  choice  without  basic  qualification.  Therefore,  the exercise of  the power  by the  Chairman would  obviously be illegal. Under  those circumstances,  the doctrine  of equal pay for  equal work  envisaged in  Article  39  (a)  of  the Constitution has  no application. It would apply only when a person is  dicharging the same duties but not being paid the same  pay  for  the  same  work.  In  this  case  since  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 petitioner is  not possessed  of minimum basic qualification to the  post to  which he  was appointed, unequals cannot be made equals  for paying equal pay for equal work.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI. J. This appeal  is filed  by the convicted accused against the judgment  of the  Punjab &  Haryana High Court in Crl.A. No. 57 of 1988 dismissing his appeal against the judgment of the Sessions  Court, Bhatinda  in Sessions  Case No.  108 of 1986. The appellant  has been convicted under Section 302 IPC for causing  death of Balwant Kaur. The incident happened in the  house   of  Balwant   Kaur.  To  prove  the  case,  the prosecution had examined her two sons Daya Singh and Kulwant Singh who  have stated that the appellant along with another Nachhattar Singh  had killed  their mother  by giving  blows with kulhari  and gandasa.  The  trial  court  believed  the evidence of  both those  witnesses and  convicted   both the accused. On  appeal the  High  Court,  though  believed  the presence of  two eye  witnesses at  the time of the incident gave benefit  of doubt  to the  second accused on the ground that he  had no reason or motive to kill Balwant Kaur. It is difficult to  appreciate the  reasoning of the High Court in this behalf  but as  he has  been acquitted  and there is no appeal by  the State,  it is  not necessary to point out how that finding is not correct. The High  Court has  held  that  both  Daya  Singh  and Kulwant Singh  were present  in the house at the time of the incident. Their presence in their own house at that time was quite natural.  If they  were present  in their  house  then obviously they  could have  seen the assault on their mother by the  appellant. Both  the courts  below have  thought  it proper to  accept their  evidence and  we see  no reason  to differ from the finding recorded in that behalf. The contention  raised on  behalf of  the appellant was that the witnesses could not have been in their house at the time when  the incident tool place. It was late evening time and therefore  their returning  to the house from their shop at that  time cannot be regarded as unnatural or improbable. As we  are of  the view  that the  High Court  was right  in confirming the  conviction of  the appellant on the basis of the evidence  of the two eye witnesses this appeal has to be dismissed. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 This  appeal   is,  therefore,  dismissed.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Division  Bench of the Delhi High Court made on February 19, 1980  in FAO  (OS) No.56/79. The respondents had filed a suit on  the original  side of  the  Delhi  High  Court  for perpetual injunction  against the  appellant from  enforcing bank guarantee dated July 16, 1977. The learned single Judge held that  no part  of the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of the High Court and, therefore, the Court lacked jurisdiction  to entertain  the suit.  On appeal, the Division Bench  concluded that  since the bank guarantee was executed in Delhi and payments were to be made in Delhi, the High  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  try  the  suit  and  the direction of  the learned  single Judge to return the plaint for presentation to the proper Court was not correct in law. Thus this appeal by special leave. The only  controversy is  whether the  Delhi High Court has jurisdiction  to entertain  the suit.  It is an admitted position that  the contract  was executed  in Bombay.  It is also  an   admitted  position   that  the   performance   of obligations and  liabilities under the contract was required to be  done in  Bombay inasmuch as Cargo of livestock was to be transported  in the ship from Kandla to Damman or Jeddah. It is  also an  admitted position that in furtherance of the execution of  the contract  at Bombay,  the respondents  had executed the  bank guarantee at Delhi and had transmitted it to Bombay  for performance  of the  contract. The  question, therefore, is  whether any  part of  the cause of action had arisen in Delhi. The learned counsel for the respondents had relied upon  a judgment  of this  Court in ABC Laminart Pvt. Ltd. &  Anr. vs.  A.P. Agencies, Salem [(1989) 2 SCC 163] to contend that since part of the cause of action had arisen in Delhi, the  High Court on the original side has jurisdiction to  entertain   the  suit.  We  are  unable  to  accept  the contention. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It is  settle law  that cause  of  action  consists  of bundle of facts which give cause to enforce the legal injury for redress  in a  court of  law. The cause of action means, therefore, every  fact, which  if transferred,  it would  be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to  a judgment  of the  Court. In other words, it is a bundle of  facts, which  taken with  the law  applicable  to them, gives  the plaintiff  a right  to claim relief against the  defendant.  It  must  include  some  act  done  by  the defendant since  in the  absence of  such an act no cause of action would  possibly accrue or would arise. In view of the admitted position  that contract  was  executed  in  Bombay, i.e., within  the jurisdiction  of the High Court of Bombay, performance of  the contract  was also to be done within the jurisdiction of  the Bombay  High Court; merely because bank guarantee  has   executed  at   Delhi  and  transmitted  for performance in  Bombay, it  does not  constitute a  cause of action to give rise to the respondent to lay the suit on the original side  of the  Delhi High Court. The contention that the Division  Bench was  right in its finding and that since the bank  guarantee was  executed and liability was enforced from the  bank at  Delhi, the Court got jurisdiction, cannot be sustained. We, therefore,  hold that  the learned single Judge was right in  his conclusion that no part of the cause of action had arisen  within the  jurisdiction on the original side of the High  Court of Delhi and direct to return the plaint for presentation to the proper court. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the Division Bench is set aside and that of learned single Judge is restored.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. These appeals  by special  leave arise  from the  order dated December  15, 1995  made in  LPA Nos. 155156/95 by the Bombay High  Court. We  need not traverse all the details of the litigation.  Suffice it  to state  that we  have  issued notice primarily  on the  question of the power of the court to re-schedule  the payment of the amounts under the consent decree. In  a consent  decree on  compromise, court would be loathe to  interfere  with  the  terms  thereof  by  way  of modification unless  both parties  give consent  thereto. On the last  occasion, when the matter had come up for hearing, Shri T.R.  Andhyrujina, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents,  had stated  that  pursuant  to  the  order passed by  the  High  Court  they  have  complied  with  the directions. Therefore,  by order  dated July  22,  1996,  we directed the respondents to file an affidavit as regards the dates on  which  compliance  had  bean  made.  In  pursuance thereof, an  affidavit has  been filed in which it is stated that all  the directions  have been  complied with  and  the payments have  been made  on  due  dates  except  the  three instalments to  be paid  in future viz.. first in this month i.e. September  96, second  in October 96, and the third and last  one,  in  December  96.  In  view  of  the  fact  that substantial amount  has already  been paid,  we do not think that it is a fit case warranting interference on the special circumstances. Another  area of controversy now sought to be raised is  the failure  to  hand  over  the  R.C.  books  in relation to  seven vehicles.  It is  stated in the affidavit and  records  have  been  placed  before  us,  to  show  the circumstances in  which the  R.C. books  could not be handed over in  relation to  five vehicles.  It is stated that with regard to  the sixth vehicle, it has been complied with now. As regards  the seventh vehicle, it is stated across the bar and also  in the  affidavit that  the vehicle  was sold as a scrap; as a consequence, R.C. book could not be handed over. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It is  stated by  Mr. C.  Sitaramiah, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants that vehicle was kept stationed and the  vehicle became a junk because of the conduct on the part of  the respondent  in not  allowing the vehicles to be used.

Counsel for the respondent was directed to produce the  record  relating to the D.P.C.  proceedings-   We  have perused  the proceedings of D.P.C. which would clearly  show that  the  reasons which prevailed with the DP.C.  were  the prosecution  under section 5(2) of Prevention of  Corruption Act  and the departmental enquiry, against the appellant  It is  not  in dispute that the proposed  departmental  enquiry a;so is related to the self same offence under section  5(2) of   the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act.   The,   judgment acquitting the appellant of the, charge under section  .,(2) became  final  and  it clearly indicate-,; that  it  was  on merits.  Therefore,  once the acquittal was  on  merits  the necessary  consequence  would  be  that  the  delinquent  is entitled  to  reinstatement as if there is no  blot  on  his service  and  the,  need for  the  departmental  enquiry  is obviated. It  is settled law that though the delinquent  official  may get  an acquittal on technical grounds, me  authorities  are entitled  to conduct departmental enquiry on the  self  same allegations  and take appropriate disciplinary action.  But, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 here,  as stated earlier, the acquittal was on  merits.  The material on the basis of which his promotion was denied  was the  sole ground of the prosecution under section  5(2)  and that ground when did not subsist, the same would not furnish the basis for DPC to overlook his promotion. We are informed that  the  departmental enquiry itself was  dropped  by  the respondents.  Under these circumstances, the very foundation an  which the D.P.C. had proceeded is clearly  illegal.  The appellant is entitled to the promotion with effect from  the date  immediate junior was promoted with  all  consequential benefits. The appeals are allowed.

In compliance with the order of this Court, a report has now been submitted by the Executive Engineer, R& B Division, Balasore, Orissa.

Mr. Mishra, Senior counsel for the petitioners, also submitted that his client is ready to vacate the suit quarters in question, if three months\022time is granted to them to vacate the same to which Mr. Das, learned counsel appearing for the municipality, has not raised any objection. 4.      Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and the submissions made on behalf of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 parties, we, therefore, dispose of this Special Leave Petition on the following terms :- i)      The petitioners are directed to vacate the quarters in question in favour of the municipality within three months from this date. ii)     If the petitioners fail to vacate these respective quarters in question, the respondent-municipality shall be at liberty to take possession by the help of the police authorities. iii)    The municipality, after taking possession within the time specified above, shall construct quarters/houses for the allottees within a period of 1 = years from the date of taken possession from the respective allottees/petitioners. 5.      We make it clear that it will be open to the petitioners to mention before this Court to ______ in the event, the municipality fails to deliver possession to the respective allottees of the new quarters/houses.  Then, it will be open to the municipality to fix reasonable monthly rent of the respective quarters of the allottees. 6.      With the above directions, this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.

" O R D E R Leave granted This appeal  arises from the judgment and order made on 20.11.91 by  the High  court of  Patna in  CWJC No.  6073 of 1991.

Subsequently he was  transferred along  with others  to the  Bihar  state water development  corporation the  appellant  .  It  is  an admitted position  that the  said Corporation has been wound up. Consequently,  instead of termination of the services of the employees  working in  the corporation,  an attempt  was made to have them accommodated in different departments. The first respondent was sent to the finance department which he had challenged.  His specific  case is  that  he  was  still having a  lien  on  the  post  he  hold  in  the  Irrigation department. That  was not  controverted in the High court by filing an  affidavit. No  contra evidence  has  been  placed before us also. The contention of the corporation and the Government is that since the Bihar state Water Development Corporation has been wound up, the employees have been adjusted in different departments. The order passed by the High court would create difficulty, if  similarly situated  employees claim the same position. We  appreciate the inconvenience of the Government but each case is required to be decided, in the light of the fact situation. It  is   an  admitted  position  that  when  the  first respondent was  initially sent  on deputation  to the  Bihar state water  Development  corporation,  he  was  allowed  to retain the lien in the parent Department and the same was to continue  until   lien  was  duly  terminated  only  on  his confirmation in  the Irrigation  Development corporation. No evidence is  placed before  us to  show that his lien in the Irrigation department  was terminated nor is he confirmed in the corporation  since the  Bihar  state  Water  Development Corporation was wound up, as he was holding lien in the post in the  parent Department, he was required to be repatriated to be repatriated to the parent Department. No Such step was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 taken.

Since  he was  not appointed  to the post, he filed the  D.A in  the Tribunal. It was contended that while he was  looking for  ward to  his appointment  in accordance with the  selection, instead  of making  the appointment the authorities issued  notification for fresh recruitment, thus , defeating the right of the petitioner and others similarly situated. Therefore, direction to the respondent authorities to appoint  him, as  per his  ranking in the select list for the year 1989 was sought. stay of fresh recruitment till the said list  got exhausted,  was also sought. The Tribunal has dismissed the petition holding that mere putting a candidate in the  select list  does not  confer on  him any  right  to appointment. Selection  was made  only for  filling  up  480 vacancies; after  the absorption   thereof, selection has to be made  for the  subsequent vacancies  from the open market and,. therefore,  directions sought  could not  be given. We find that the reasons given . We find that the reasons given by the  Tribunal are  well  justified.  Merely  because  the petitioner has been put in the waiting list, he does not get any vested  right to an appointment. It is not his case that any one  below his  ranking in  the waiting  list  has  been appointed which could give him cause for grievance. Thus, he cannot seek any direction for his appointment.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati. J. This appeal  is directed against the judgment and order passed by the Designated Court, Sangrur in Sessions Case No. 55 of 1993. The respondent  was tried  for the  offences punishable under Section  25 of  the Arms  Act and  Section  5  of  the Terrorists and  Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred  to as  ""the TADA  Act"").  The  charge against him  was that he was found in unlawful possession of one. 12  DBBL Gun  and four  live cartridges on 15.5.1992 in village Khillan,  which has been declared as a notified area under the  TADA Act.  The designated  Court  held  that  the evidence of PW.1 H.C. Baldev Singh and PW.3 Constable Basant Singh was sufficient to establish that the respondent was in unlawful possession  of Gun  and four  live cartridges.  The Designated Court,  however, did  not scrutinise the evidence further and  thought it fit to acquit the respondent only on the ground  that as no sanction under Section 39 of the Arms Act was obtained to initiate prosecution against the accused under Section  25 of  the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act, has,  ""the effect  of enhancing  penalty as  prescribed under the  Arms Act"", the accused cannot be tried for either of the offences. Aggrieved by  the order  of acquittal,  the  State  has filed this  appeal. We  are of the opinion that Mr. Sodhi is right in  contending that  the view  taken by the Designated Court that in absence of sanction for prosecuting an accused under the  Arms Act,  the cannot  be prosecuted  even  under Section 5 of the TADA Act, is wrong. But it is not necessary to allow  this appeal and remand the case to the  Designated Court as  the  respondent  deserves  to  be  acquitted  even otherwise on merits. Though the evidence of PW.1 H.C. Baldev Singh and  PW.3 Basant Singh establishes that the respondent was found  in possession  of one.  12 bore DBBL Gun and four live cartridges,  there is  no satisfactory evidence to show that  the   said  Gun  and  the  cartridges  were  sent  for examination by  the Central  Forensic scientific Laboratory. There is  no report  from the forensic Scientific Laboratory nor any  other evidence  to prove that the said gun was in a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 working condition  or that  the said  cartridges  were  live cartridges. An  entry made  in  the  Malkhana  register  was relied upon by the prosecution. It does not mention that Gun bearing No.  14119-88  was  sent  to  the  Central  Forensic Laboratory nor  does  it  contain  any  description  of  the cartridges. Therefore, in  absence of any evidence to show that the respondent is  found in  possession of one. 12 bore DBBL Gun in  a  working  condition  and  four  live  cartridges,  the respondent cannot  be convicted  under Section 5 of the TADA Act.

" O R D E R The  order   of  termination  of  the  service  of  the petitioner was  challenged by  filing an  application  under Section 19  of the  Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 before the  Central   Administrative  Tribunal,   New  Delhi.  Such application has  been dismissed  by the  impugned order. The applicant was  appointed Judge, Chandigarh, vide order dated March 17,  1982. He  was continuing  in temporary service on probation put  it appears  that his  service was  not  found satisfactory and  as  a  matter  of  fact  on  a  number  of occasions he  was found  by the successive judicial officers under whom  the applicant was working that his integrity was questionable. Considering his service records, the temporary service of the applicant has been terminated. Mr. P.P.  Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner has submitted that if termination has in fact been effected  by way of punishment, the real purpose of the order and not the outer form of it, is required to be looked into by  piercing the  veil, He has submitted that if on the score of  misconduct, the  service,  is  terminated  without holding by departmental proceeding and giving the petitioner a chance of showing cause, the order of    parte termination of service  on the ground of misconduct is illegal and void. Even in  the case  of temporary  service, the  provisions of Article 311  of the  Constitution of India is applicable. In support of  such contention,  reference has been made to the decision of this Court in Jarnail Singh and Ors. etc. versus State of Punjab (1986 (2) SCR 1022). It, however, appears to us that  no discriminatory  treatment has  been meted out to the petitioner  as was done to the employee concerned in the said decision. It appears that the service of the petitioner was  found   unsatisfactory  for   the   reasons   indicated hereinbefore. Since  the petitioner  was holding a temporary service and  was  on  probation,  an  order  of  termination simplicitor has  been passed  without attaching  any  stigma against   him.   As   the   service   records   were   found http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 unsatisfactory,  the   termination  order   cannot  be  held arbitrary and  dapricious. In the aforesaid facts, we do not thing that in reality an order of punishment has been passed against  the   petitioner  in  the  clocks  or  pretence  of termination simplicitor  without  holding  any  departmental proceeding   thereby   violating.   Article   311   of   the Constitution. We  therefore. find  no merit in this petition and the same is dismissed.","The applicant was appointed Judge, Chandigarh, vide order dated March 17, 1982.

No.8654/95. The admitted  position is that though lease was granted to the  appellants on  December 5, 1994 for one year and was executed, as  admitted by the respondents, on the said date, it expired  on December  5, 1995.  It is  contended that the lease  granted  to  the  appellants  was  cancelled  by  the Commissioner on February 17, 1995 and on a revision filed by the appellants  to the State Government by order dated March 23, 1995,  the order  of the Commissioner was set aside. But unfortunately the  operation of  the order of the Government was stayed  by the  High Court  on May  21, 1995  and it set aside the  order of the Government by the impugned order. It is not in dispute that pursuant to the direction of the High Court the  auctions were  conducted and  third parties  have been inducted  to work  out the  excavation of the sand; but they are  not before  us. Though  there is some force in the argument of  the learned  counsel for  the  appellants  that since the  working of the period of the lease granted to the appellants was  not allowed  to be fully utilised on account of the  orders passed by the courts or the Commissioner, the time may be extended for the appellants to execute the lease and work  out the  lease for  the residue  period, as stated earlier, since  the third  party rights  have  already  been intervened, in their absence we cannot give the direction as sought for.

VERSUS THE RURAL INSTITUTE, AMRAVATI & ANR. ETC.ETC. O R D E R We   do   not   find   any   justification   warranting interference in  this matter. Admittedly, notification under Section 4(1)  of the  Land Acquisition  Act (for short, ‘the Act’) was  published on  January 29, 1957 and thereafter the owner sold  the properties  to the  petitioners on  June 11, 1957 and  August 22,  1958. Declaration  under Section 6 was published on  August 14,  1958. Thus,  it could be seen that the sales  made after  the publication  of the  notification under Section 4(1) are void sales and the State is not bound by such a sale effected by the owner. Admittedly, the notice under Section 9 and 10 September 23, 1958 and award was made on October  9, 1959 and possession was taken on November 18, 1959. Thus,  the acquisition was complete. The possession of the Government is complete as against the original owner and title of  the  original  owner  stood  extinguished  and  by operation of  Section 16 the State acquires the right, title and interest  in the property free from all encumbrances. So any encumbrance  made by  the owner after notification under Section  4(1)   was  published  does  not  bind  the  State. Possession would be taken through the usual mode of drafting a panchanama by the officer and signed by the witness. It is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 complete and  conclusive. Thereby  it is  clear, as found by the court  below that  possession was  taken as  a fact  and handed over  to the  3rd respondent-society.  Therefore, the Society became the absolute owner of the acquired lands free from all  encumbrances. The  claim of  the petitioners  that they  have   perfected  title   by  adverse  possession  was negatived  by   all  the  Courts.  No  question  of  adverse possession arises unless it is pleaded and proved that after the  possession  was  taken  and  handed  over  to  the  3rd respondent, the  petitions have  asserted their own right to the knowledge  of the 3rd respondent and it had acquisced in it and  remained in  uninterrupted possession and enjoyment, nec vi,  nec lam  and nec  pre cario. That was not the case. Therefore, they  cannot  have  any  semblance  of  right  by prescription. It  is rather  unfortunate that  State filed a suit for  possession. They  should have  resorted to summery eviction under  the Public  Premises Act  etc. instead  they have gone  to the Civil Court.

Under these  circumstances, the only remedy open to  the petitioner  is to avail the action in the suit. Since the  limitation has  run out  to file  a civil suit by now, which  was not so on the date of the filing of the writ petition, the  civil Court  is required  to  exclude,  under Section 14  of the  Limitation Act,  1963, the  entire  time taken by  the High Court in disposing of the matter from the date of the institution of the writ petition. Normally for  application  of  Section  14,  the  Court dealing with  the matter in the first instance, which is the subject of  the issue  in the  later case,  must be found to have lack  of jurisdiction  or other cause of like nature to entertain  the   matter.  However,   since  the  High  Court expressly declined to grant relief relegating the petitioner to a  suit in  civil Court,  the petitioner  cannot be  left remedyless.

[(1997) 3  SCALE 1) In the  present case,  the appellants  Satram Committee claimed the  status of  as  a  denominational  temple  under Article 26  (d) of the constitution. The High Court has held that they  have the denominational status, but, nonetheless, it was  negatived on  the ground that the Managing Committee would be  appointed with  non-official and  official members under  the   A.P  Charitable   and  Religious   Institutions Endowment Act.  Thus, the appellants claimed the status of a denominational one  and the  Government has  questioned  the later direction.  Admittedly, the  Arya Vysya  Community  is having as  many as  102 gotras.  In other  words,  they  are representing a  large segment  of Hindus worshipping Goddess Matha Kanyakaparameswari. In the above cited case, the claim was that  the Hindus  who worship  God  Shiva  constitute  a denominational section  entitled to  the benefit of Articles 26(b) and  26(d) of   the  Constitution. A  Bench  of  three Judges, to  which    both of us were members, had considered the matter  in detail and held that Hindu Worshippers of God Shiva are  not a denominational section and, therefore, they are not  entitled to  the benefit  of Articles 26 (b) and 26 (d) of  the Constitution  for  management  of  the  Temples. Following the  above ratio,  we hold that the Hindu sections of the  Arya  vysya  Community  who  worship  Goddess  Matha Kanyakaparameswari are  not denominational  section for  the purpose of  Articles 26(b) and 26(d) of the Constitution.

" O R D E R Leave granted. These appeals  by special leave arise from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Madras High  Court, made  on January 9,  1997 in  CMA No.  843/96 and  WP Nos.  9771  and 12007/96. N.M.S.S Vellaichamy  Nadar College  was established  by Nadar Mahajan  Sangam in  the year  1965 and election to the Society  which   runs  the  college,  is  the  bone  of  the contention.  Untrammeled   by  procedural  formats  and  its ramifications in  the process  of election, the heart of the matter is good management of the college. Who is entitled to run the  institution the college. Who is entitled to run the institution and  administer property of the said institution is the  crux of  the question.  It is  not in  dispute  that though the term of the previous Society Committee expired on March 31,  1966, elections  could not be held for one reason or  the  other.  As  a  consequence,  at  the  pain  of  the entrustment of the management to the third agency, elections came to  be held  on June  9, 1996,  which proved  to be  an abortive attempt.  Consequent thereon,  a complaint was made to the  Registrar in  Form No.7 on June 12, 1996. An enquiry appears to  have been  held by the Registrar which failed in the process  from legal  perspectives  but  the  report  was submitted on  June 19, 1996. In the meanwhile, OS No. 417/96 was filed  for perpetual  injunction. An  interim  mandatory injunction  was  issued  in  I.A.  No.292/96  directing  the District Registrar  appointed under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act,  1975 (for  short, the  ‘Act’) to find out factual position  and then  to submit  the report.  In   the meanwhile, writ  petitions came to be filed. Ultimately, the Division Bench came to the conclusion that the learned trial Judge had  abdicated  his  functioning  as  an  adjudicatory authority; he  should have  recorded the  evidence  and  the findings by  himself. Instead,  he directed the Registrar to conduct an  enquiry and, thereby, it is a case of abdication of judicial functioning. Accordingly, the impugned order was passed. We have  heard learned  counsel for  both the  parties. With a  view to  shorten  the  litigation,  the  appropriate http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 course would be as under: The civil Court is directed to appoint an Advocate as a Commissioner. The  Advocate-Commissioner would  take all the members of  the Society existing as on May 14, 1996 as valid members.  He   should  conduct   the  elections   afresh  in accordance with  the procedure prescribed under the bye-laws of the  Society. Till  the elections are held, the Principal shall continue  to hold  charge of  the  management  of  the institution and  will act  as Receiver  of the  Court  under Order XL,  Rule 1, CPC. He shall be answerable to the Court. On receipt of the report from the Advocate-Commissioner, the civil Court  shall pass  appropriate orders  in the light of the  report   thus  submitted   and  dispose   of  the  suit accordingly.  The  expenditure  incurred  and  fees  of  the Advocate-Commissioner should  be as  determined by the civil Court. Elections  are directed  to  be  conducted  within  a period of  six weeks from the date of the appointment of the Advocate-Commissioner by the trial Court. The trial Court is directed to  appoint the  Commissioner within two weeks from the date  of the  receipt of  the order.  The trial Court is directed to  dispose of  the suit, after the election report is submitted, within three months thereafter. The fee of the Advocate-Commissioner should  be  determined  by  the  trial Court. The  same shall  be born  by  the  successful  party.

Banathia,  learned counsel  for the respondents.  We have perused the  charge framed against the appellant and the reports submitted  by the  Inquiry  Officer, the orders of the Director  General of  Police, the M.P. Administrative Tribunal and  also  of the High Court. The  charge framed against the appellant  reads  as follows: ""On   25.1.1993 by detaining Shri  Ram  Singh s/o  Deshraj Singh Parthar without any reason and  keeping  his license, cycle and  Rs.50/- with  him and demanding Rs.1000/- for  giving the  item  back and receiving the money.   In this  way  you  have given utmost  disrespect towards  your  duty  and by  showing  corrupt behaviour  you have proved yourself  not  fit for the department."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 A  perusal  of the Inquiry Officer’s  report  would clearly  go to show that no independent witness  had  been examined  to  prove  the demand and taking  money  by  the appellant  in  his  hand  nor is  there  any  evidence  of detaining  the  applicant  in a  half  constructed  house. When  the  matter was taken on appeal before the  Director General  of  Police, he reduced the penalty  of  dismissal given  by the Superintendent of Police and reinstated  the accused  and  also reverted the appellant to the  post  of Constable from that of Head Constable as a penalty  for  a period   of  two  years  from  16.11.1993  to  16.11.1995. Aggrieved against the imposition of the said penalty,  the appellant   preferred  original  application  before   the Administrative   Tribunal  in  O.A.   No.875/1994,   which affirmed  the  penalty  imposed by  the  Deputy  Inspector General of Police and the Director General of Police. The  matter  was  taken to the High  Court  by  the appellant by filing a writ petition under Article  227  of the  Constitution of India.  The High Court  affirmed  the orders   passed  by  all  the  other  Authorities.   Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred the above civil  appeal in this Court. We  have already reproduced in paragraph supra  the charge  framed against the appellant.  There is absolutely no evidence in regard to the demand of bribe of Rs.1,000/- or  receipt of the same by the appellant.  No satisfactory evidence  was  adduced to prove the  charge  in  question. Under  such  circumstances, the  penalty  imposed  by  the Director General of Police de-promoting him from the  post of  Head Constable to the post of Constable cannot at  all be  countenanced.  In our opinion, the case on hand  is  a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 case  of no evidence.  It is also a matter of record  that the  appellant  had an unblemished service  record  of  21 years and the said factor has also not been considered  by the Authorities while imposing the penalty. We,  therefore,  have no hesitation in setting  aside  the punishment  inflicted  on  the appellant  and  allow  this appeal.   The  period  of two years mentioned  hereinabove will  be  treated  as the appellant was on  duty  as  Head Constable and the appellant will also be entitled  to  all the monetary benefits for the said period. In   the   result,  the  judgments  of  the   M.P. Administrative  Tribunal  and the  High  Court  stand  set aside.  The Civil Appeal is allowed.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI,J. The appellant  was tried  alongwith three other accused for causing  the death  of  manna  Singh.  The  trial  court convicted him  under Section 302 IPC and acquitted the other accused. The High Court confirmed his conviction as it found that the  evidence of  the three  eye-witness, PW  2  Swaran Singh, PW  3 -  Raj Singh  and PW  4 -  Amar Singh  is quite consistent and  their evidence proves that the appellant had given a  barchha blow  to Manna  singh on  his  chest  which proved to  be fatal.  the High  Court after appreciating the evidence also recorded a finding that their evidence did not require any corroboration. However, it  was contended  by the  learned counsel for the  appellant   that  the   three  eye-witnesses   had  not specifically stated  before the  police when their statement were recorded  under Section  161 Cr.  P.C. that Amrik Singh had given the fatal blow to the deceased. Merely because the witnesses have  not specifically stated which blow was given by which accused their evidence cannot be discarded if it is found  to  be  otherwise  reliable.  the  eye-witnesses  had received injuries  during this very incident; and therefore, their presence  at the  time  of  the  incident  has  to  be believed. they  have specifically stated that after reaching the spot  on hearing  cries, they  had prevented the accused from giving  further blows  to Manna  Singh. With respect to this part  of their  evidence, they were not contradicted by their police  statements. Therefore,  there can  be no doubt regarding their having seen the blows given by the appellant merely because they had not specifically referred to them in their police  statements. The  courts below  have thought it fit to  believe the  evidence against Amrik Singh and we see no reason  to differ  from  the  finding  recorded  in  that behalf. As we  find  no  substance  in    this  appeal,  it  is dismissed. The appellant  was released on bail during the pendency of this  appeal.

The appellant also obtained no-objection from the Director, Archaeology & Museums Department, Jaipur.  Under the above scheme, the appellant issued an advertisement for auction of the commercial plots.  Pursuant to the said advertisement, a civil suit bearing No.43/2003 was filed for permanent injunction restraining the appellant from auctioning the commercial plots under the scheme.

" JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(2) SCR 217 The following Order of the Court was delivered The Taluk Land Board constituted under the Kerala Land Reforms Act 9 (for short, ’the Act’) is in appeal against the common order made by a learned single judge of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam, in C.R.P. Nos. 1669 and 2453 of 1993, on November 18, 1996. By the impugned order, the High Court accepted the sale deeds executed by the sisters of the declarant- Cyriac Thomas (the first respondent) resulting in leaving no excess land to be surrendered by him. The point that arises for consideration is whether the sisters of the declarant had title to the land or it, in fact, belonged to the declarant and therefore, the sales ought to be ignored and the land added to his holding. One Mr. Elanjikkal Cyriac died sometime before 1958. He was survived by his three sons, including the declarant, and four daughters. He left some agricultural land. As long back as in 1978, the appellant held that the declarant had no excess land to surrender, However, in 1980, the case was reopened and after taking into consideration the objections filed by him, the appellant held that the first respondent had 9.87 acres of land in excess of the ceiling limit as on January 1, 1970. On December 5, 1985 the High Court on the civil revision petition filed against the said order, remanded the matter to the appellant. After remand, the appellant by its order dated August 12, 1993 quantified the excess land (7.26.040 acres) which was to be surrendered by him. It was against that order of the appellant two civil revision petitions were filed - one by the declarant and the other by his three sisters. The High Court disposed them of by the impugned judgment, referred to above. That is how the present appeals are before us. The germane question is whether the declarant, his two brothers and four sisters are entitled to a share in the land left by the deceased Elanjikkal Cyriac. The answer to question determines the result of this case. If all of them had inherited the land, the appeals are bound to fail but if it is found the sisters did not, then sales effected by them would be invalid and the appellant will have to succeed, the declarant shall be liable to surrender the excess land as held by the appellant. Succession to the estate of a person was governed by the Travancore Christian Succession Act, 1092 in the erstwhile State of Travancore Cochin which was a Part-B Stale. The Indian Succession Act was extended to the Travancore Cochin State by Part-B States (Laws) Act. 1951. Consequently, all the children of the deceased Cyriac inherited the land under the Indian Succession Act. It is not disputed that if the Indian Succession Act applies, all the sisters will be entitled to equal share along with the brothers in the properties http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 left by the deceased Elanjikkal Cyriac. This position came to be recognised by the judgment of this Court in Mary Roy and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Ors., [1986] 2 SCC 209. This court laid down that on extension of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 to Part-B State of Travancore Cochin, the Indian Succession Act applied to succession opened thereafter. It follows that all the sisters had share in the land and, therefore, the land covered by the sales in question could not be added to the holding of the declarant as the deed executed by them would be valid. In this view of the matter, the order under challenge warrants no interference. The appeals fail and they are dismissed but in the circumstances of the case, without any order as to costs.","The Taluk Land Board constituted under the Kerala Land Reforms Act 9 (for short, ’the Act’) is in appeal against the common order made by a learned single judge of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard the learned counsel on both sides. The only  question for  consideration  is:  Doordarshan Kendra, Trivandrum  that he  would not  claim his  seniority held in Salem w.e.f. August 19, 1984. Shri E.M.S.  Anam, learned  counsel for  the  appellant contended that since the transfer had come to be made due to administrative exigencies,  viz., abolition  of the post and creation of  the post  and availability  of the  vacancy  in Tamil Nadu,  the transfer  was not on account of the request made by the appellant and that, therefore, the seniority had to be  reckoned from  the date  of his  initial appointment, i.e.,  September   21,  1983.   We  find  no  force  in  the contention. It is  now settled  legal position that on abolition of the post, the holder of the post has no right to continue on the  post.  Instead  of  retrenching  him  as  surplus,  the Government have  accommodated him  in the  available vacancy and, therefore,  it must be deemed to be a fresh appointment for the  purposes of  seniority. After  joining in  Salem in Tamil Nadu, he made a request for transfer to Trivandrum and it is  at his request that he was transferred. Consequently, on his  undertaking in  the application  that he  would  not claim his  seniority at  Salem  Station,  the  transfer  was effected at  his request.  It is settled legal position that he  would  take  his  seniority  as  junior-most  among  the confirmed employees in the transferee-region. Considered from  this perspective,  we are  of the view that the  Tribunal  has  not  committed  any  error  of  law warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.2514  OF 2002 Heard the parties. The controversy involved in this appeal is with regard to the promotion from the post of Deputy Keeper(Archaeology) to the post of Curator/Keeper (Archaeology). Under the Rules the post of Deputy Keeper (Archaeology) is a feeder post for promotion to the post of Curator/Keeper(Archaeology). Under the relevant recruitment rules the requisite qualification is five years serving as Deputy Keeper(Archaeology). The question raised in this appeal is, as to whether the appellant possessed requisite qualification for the promotion to the post of Curator/Keeper(Archaeology). Undisputed facts are that the appellant was appointed as Deputy Keeper(Archaeology) on 01.04.1992. He was promoted to the post of Curator/Keeper (Archaeology) on 22.06.1999. The Rules clearly provides that  for the post of Keeper(Archaeology) the appointment is made by way of promotion, failing which by direct recruits. The Tribunal also found that the requisite qualification is five years in the grade.  The Tribunal has also recorded a finding that the respondent was not Deputy Keeper(Archaeology) and, therefore, he is not entitled to be promoted to the post of Curator/Keeper(Archaeology). The appellant was appointed as Deputy Keeper(Archaeology) with effect from 01.04.1992 and he was promoted to the post of Curator/Keeper(Archaeology) on 22.06.1999.

The appellant  claims to  have been appointed on ad hoc basis by  proceedings dated  October 26,  1990. Gautam Kumar Chakraborty, the  first respondent  and  the  appellant  had joined the  Department on  January 27,  1986. The  Committee constituted for  their selection, found the first respondent to be  number one and the appellant as number 3 in the list. Admittedly, regular appointments are subject to confirmation by the  Orissa Public Service Commission. Instead of sending the names  to the Commission for consideration, the Minister recommended for  appointment of  the  appellant.  The  first respondent naturally had approached the Tribunal staking his claim for confirmation. The Tribunal directed the Government to refer  to the  matter, in  terms of  the  Rules,  to  the Commission which  after considering the respective merits of all the candidates had selected D. Mullick as number 1, B.N. Sahoo as  number 2,  appellant as  number 3 and Gautam Kumar Chakraborty as  number 4  and recommended  for  appointment.

In the present case, undisputedly, all the appellants have passed out secondary school examination and they have undergone nine months training not only from the institutes recognised by the Government but from the Government hospitals itself.

Accordingly, the appeals are allowed, impugned orders are set aside and it is held that the appellants are eligible for consideration for the post of Laboratory Technicians.  Undisputedly, prior to the filing of the writ petitions, no advertisement was issued for filling up the posts of Laboratory Technicians.  This being the position, it is directed that the appellants shall be considered for appointment on the posts of Laboratory Technicians, whenever the same are advertised and if it is so advertised, they can apply for the same.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard the  counsel for  the parties. This appeal by  special leave  arises from  the order of the Division Bench  of the  High Court  of  Patna  made  on November 11,  1993 in  CWJC No.13107/92. Admittedly one Shyama Devi  was a teacher who died on August 17, 1988. She nominated certain persons to be entitled to receive the G.P.F.  etc. on  her behalf.  It would  appear that three persons laid the claim which was accordingly made over. When  the respondent  claimed  to  be  son  of  a brother  of   the  deceaseds,  he  was  asked  for  the succession certificate.  By the  time he  produced  the certificate, the  amount had  already been  paid to the claimants.  Therefore,  the  respondent  filed  a  writ petition. The  Division Bench of the High Court allowed the writ  petition and  directed to make the payment to him. Thus this appeal by special leave. In view  of the fact that the State had discharged the  liability  in  terms  of  the  nomination  by  the deceased teacher,  the inter  se claims if any, have to be adjudicated  only on  the regular  constituted forum and the  State cannot be compelled to pay twice over on the succession  certificate produced by the respondent. Under these  circumstances, the direction issued by the High Court is clearly illegal. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of the High  Court is  set aside. If any other claim is to be discharged,  the same may be done in accordance with law. This  order does  not preclude  the respondent  to take       action        according       to        law.","One Shyama Devi was a teacher who died on August 17, 1988.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Special  Leave  Petition (Civil) No. 4059 of 1979. From the Judgment and Order dated 30-1-79 of the Punjab and Haryana  High Court  in Civil  Writ Petition  No. 106 of 1979. Soli J.  Sorabjee, Addl. Sol. Genl. of India and Girish Chandra for the Petitioner. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.  The  Additional  Solicitor  General appearing for  the Petitioner,  the Assistant  Collector  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Central Excise,  complains that  the Order of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is a wrong exercise of its jurisdiction  because there  is an alternative statutory remedy under  the Central  Excise Act  for relief when goods are seized.  It is  correct to  say that the High Court must have regard  to the  well  established  principles  for  the exercise of its writ jurisdiction and unless it is satisfied that the  normal  statutory  remedy  is  likely  to  be  too dilatory or  difficult to  give reasonably  quick relief, it should be  loath to  act  under  Article  226.  May  be,  in exceptional 135 cases-the present  one does not appear to be one-that extra- ordinary power may be exercised. So it is right to point out that the  High  Courts  will  be  careful  to  be  extremely circumspect in  granting these reliefs especially during the pendency of  criminal investigations. The investigation of a criminal  offence  is  a  very  sensitive  phase  where  the investigating authority has to collect evidence from all odd corners and anything that is likely to thwart its course may inhibit the  interests of justice. All that we need say here is that  the High  Courts will  bear in  mind the  need  for extreme  reluctance  when,  during  the  investigation,  any relief interim  or final,  which has a tendency to slow down or otherwise hamper the investigation, is sought. In  the   present  case,   the  requirements  that  the prosecution put  forward were  readily granted  by the  High Court and  the need  for the containers which bear tell-tale testimony necessary for the investigation does not appear to have been  pointed out to the High Court. We certainly agree that even  while releasing the goods the Courts must be very careful to  see  that  every  condition  or  need  that  the investigator points  out as  essential for  discharging  his investigative functions,  should be  readily conceded by the Court unless  plainly unreasonable.  After all, at the stage of investigation  it is  risky for  the Court  to  intervene except where  manifest injustice  cries for the Order of the Court. With these observations, we dismiss the Petition. N.V.K.

Leave granted These  appeals,   by  special  leave,  arise  from  the judgment of  the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court, dated December  22, 1995  made in  M.F.A. Nos.  2688/88  and batch. Notification under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act (for  Short, the ’Act’) acquiring a large extent of land was published  on  March  25,  1971.  The  Land  acquisition Officer in ....... award granted compensation at the rate of Rs. 8,000/- per acre for the dry lands with which we are not concerned. We  are not  concerned with  other  land  because there is  no appeal  in the  behalf.  On  reference    under section  18  of  the  Act,  the  Civil  Court  enhanced  the compensation to  Rs.  15,000/-  per  acre.  The  High  Court remitted   the   matter   to   the   reference   Court   for reconsideration. Thereafter,  the reference  Court  enhanced the compensation  to Rs. 38,000/-. On appeal, the High Court by the  impugned judgment  has enhanced  the compensation to Rs. 12/- per sq. yd. which amounts to Rs. 58.000/- per acre. It is  seen the  since the  respondents have  not filed  any appeal under  Section  26  of  the  Act  against  the  award granting enhanced  compensation of Rs. 38,000/- per acre, we do not  propose to  go into  the enhancement  granted by the reference Court. The only  question is:  whether the High Court would be justified in  enhancing the compensation to Rs. 12/- per sq. yd., in  other words, Rs. 58,000/- per acre. Admittedly, the land is  dry land  and  the  land  Acquisition  Officer  had pointed out  in his award that the converted lands for which he had  awarded compensation  at the rate of Rs. 9,000/- and Rs. 10,000/-  per acre,  bear different  connotation to  the actual dry  land existing  as on  that date.  The  potential value shall  be determined  for the  land existing as on the date of  the notification and not after subsequent developed land bears no relevance to further enhancement of the value. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Under  these   circumstances,  the  High  Court  has  wholly incorrect in  enhancing the compensation to Rs. 12/- per sq. yd., i.e. Rs. 58,000/- per acre.

It was further alleged that the petitioner with fraudulent and dishonest intention to cheat the complainant tried to wriggle out of the agreement. According to him, the agreement was entered into at Bangalore.  The payments were made at Bangalore and all the witnesses are residing at Bangalore. In the Transfer Petition, the petitioner has controverted the allegations made by the respondent and has prayed for transfer of the case to Bombay keeping in view the fact that she is a widow aged 80 years and suffering from Cancer and it would not be possible for her to effectively defend herself in the complaint filed by the respondent at Bangalore.  It would be difficult for her to travel to and fro to Bangalore from Bombay because of her age and the disease from which she is suffering. Counsel for the parties have been heard at length. Keeping in view the age of the petitioner and the fact that she is suffering from Cancer, we deem it appropriate to transfer CC No. 11090/2003 (PCR No. 131 of 2002) from the Court of IXth Addl.

A detention memo issued to the respondent stating that the goods lying in the factory premises, specified in the schedule, were liable for confiscation.  The respondent was ordered not to dispose of the goods in question or otherwise deal with or part with the same unless he heard in the matter to the proper Central Excise Authority and a notice was issued on 5.11.1996 to the respondent to show cause as to why the goods should not be classified as stated above. The respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging this show cause notice and the detention order. On an earlier occasion on similar adjudication, the appellate authority had upheld the claim of the assessee. The High Court proceeded on the basis that the appellate order had become final and expressing agreements with the same, quashed the notice.  The argument on behalf of the appellant is that if the view of the High Court is correct a classification cannot be reviewed and any such classification once made cannot be reviewed even if the earlier view is erroneous, and such a course would result in great loss of revenue was not accepted and allowed their petition and quashed the show cause notice.  Hence this appeal. The matter relating to commodity classification whether it falls under one heading or the other or attracts higher or lower duty has to be decided on facts arising in each case.  Even though, the decision may have been taken earlier at one point of time but on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 further investigation discover new fact or the law has changed, as is the stand in the present case, the matter has to be re-examined.  It is not at all proper for the High Court to interfere in such matters at the stage of issue of the show cause notice.

It shall be open to the respondent to file reply to the show cause notice as they deem fit, if not already filed within a period of one month from today or such further time as may be allowed by the Adjudicating Authority.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Notification under  s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, ""the Act"") acquiring a large extent of land for construction  of Vengalarayasagar Project, West Godavari District of  Andhra Pradesh,  was published on September 20, 1979.  The   Land  Acquisition  Officer  in  his  award  had determined compensation  at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per acre for wet  land and  had also  granted value  of  the  coconut trees. The  Subordinate Judge  on  reference  under  s.18(1) enhanced the market value to Rs.22,000/- per acre. He relied upon two  sale deeds  and Ex.A2,  an agreement of sale dated December 15,  1976,  for  a  large  extent  of  land  for  a consideration of  Rs.15,000/-. One  sale deed  was  executed under Ex.A3  on September 22, 1978. Another document, Ex. A1 was executed  on the  same day  for a sum of Rs.19,800/-. It has come  on record  that the  project  was  inaugurated  on August 28,  1976. The  lower Court enhanced the compensation to Rs.22,000/-  per acre  relying upon  the above documents. However, in  another matter,  a learned  single Judge of the High Court  by his  judgment dated  February  14,  1985  had confirmed the  compensation in respect of neighbouring lands acquired earlier,  at Rs.22,000/-  per  acre.  The  Division Bench,  however,   by  the   impugned  order   reduced   the compensation to  Rs.20,000/-. Thus  this appeal  by  special leave. Unfortunately,  the State  has  not  come  in  appeal against the enhanced compensation. The only  question is whether the appellant is entitled to compensation @ Rs.22,000/- per acre. It is seen that when the Project  was inaugurated  on August  28, 1976, all these documents obviously  had been  brought up  for inflating the market  value.  Unfortunately,  all  these  facts  were  not brought to  the notice  of the  learned single Judge when he confirmed the  compensation of  the  land  at  the  rate  of Rs.22,000/- per  acre. It is settled law that it is the duty http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the  court to consider the evidence in proper perspective and to  determine the  compensation. In each case, the court sitting in the arm chair of a * willing purchaser would as a prudent person offer the market value when the owner offered the land  for sale. Once the project was inaugurated and the lands were  acquired, no  prudent person  would come forward and purchase  the same  at higher rates. It may be depressed sales in  case of  acute necessity and urgency of the seller for money.  Under these circumstances, we hold that the sale deeds were  brought up  sales and  the enhancement  was  not justified. We  do not  propose to  interfere with the matter and cannot also enhance the market value. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

One  of  the arguments of the appellant as noted  by  my learned  brother was that the Court in the Synthetics  case by resorting to prospective over-ruling had in a fact sought to  uphold  a law upto the period of the judgment which  law had  held  to  have been passed without competence.   It  is submitted  that  the  finding  that   the  States  were  not competent  to levy tax on industrial alcohol meant that  the State  Acts  were  non est and that the Court could  not  by giving  prospective effect to its judgment breathe life into a  dead statute up to the date of the judgment.  It was also contended  by the appellant that even under Article 142, the Court  could  not whittle down or act in derogation  of  any constitutional provision.  By declaring that the statute was valid  up  to  the date of the judgment,  according  to  the appellant,  the specific constitutional provisions,  namely, Articles  246 and Article 245 were infringed.  Reliance  has been placed on the decision of this Court in Prem Chand Garg vs.   Excise Commissioner, U.P., Allahabad 1963 (1) SCR  885 and  Supreme  Court Bar Association V.  Union of  India  and Another 1998 (4) SCC 409. The   argument   of   the   appellant  proceeds   on   a misunderstanding  of the effect of prospective  over-ruling. As  has  been  elaborately stated in  my  learned  brothers judgment,  by  prospective  over-ruling the Court  does  not grant  the  relief  claimed  even   after  holding  in   the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 claimants  favour.   In this case, the Court held that  the statutory provision imposing vend fee was invalid.  Strictly speaking, this would have entitled the appellant to a refund from the respondents of all amounts collected by way of vend fee.   But  because,  as stated in the  Synthetics  decision itself,  over  a period of time imposts and levies had  been imposed  by  virtue  of the earlier decision  and  that  the States  as  well  as the petitioners and  manufacturers  had adjusted  their  rights and their positions on  that  basis, this  relief was denied.  The Court did not, by denying  the relief,  authorise or validate what had been declared to  be illegal  or  void  nor  did it imbue  the  legislature  with competence upto the date of the judgment.","Ruma Pal, J concurs with the reasoning and conclusions reached by my learned brother Kirpal, J.

The respondent-State exercising the power under Section 4(2) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954, (for short, the ’Act’) by a notification dated March 9, 1970 had exempted Papad and Badi, i.e.  Mangori from sales tax.  When the appellant made an application  for exemption of Gole Papad manufactured out of Maida, Salt Starch, Papad Soda, Alum and Food colour from sales  tax   under  the   above  notification,   the   Addl. Commissioner by  proceeding dated  27.8.82  held  that  Gole Papad was  not covered by the notification.  When the appeal came to  be filed, the Sales Tax Tribunal by its order dated 17.3.86 allowed  the appeal  and held  that the notification would govern all variety of Papad, whether they are circular or flat  in shape  consisting of all the ingredients whether it is  pulses, rice, maida, etc.  When the State carried the matter in  revision, it came to be allowed by the High Court and it  held that  the appellant  is  not  entitled  to  the exemption.  Thus this appeal by special leave. It is  seen that the notification clearly mentions that the word  ’Papad’ has  been used a genus and its species are made from  pulses, rice,  maida, potato,  sago etc.   In the notification the  words ""Papad  and Badi"", i.e. Mangori have been used  while in entry No.3 of the notification after the words  ""letter   head  pads""  the  words  ""other  stationery articles made  of handmade  paper"" have  been  used  meaning thereby that entry No.3 is not restricted to only invitation cards, envelopes,  file covers,  letter heads  pads but also includes other  stationery articles  made of handmade paper. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The question  is:  whether  the  ingredients  of  papad  are exclusively composed  of the  pulses or  maida or rice, etc? When the  notification mentions papad and Badi, i.e. Mangori it would  appear that  they did  not intend to differentiate between gole or flat papad made of any ingredient. Under  those   circumstances  it   appears   that   the interpretation given  by the  High Court  is not correct and that of Tribunal is correct. The appeal is allowed and if there is any difficulty it would be  open to the Govt. to make necessary declaration in exemption notification  itself by  way  of  amendment.

He should be  given an  opportunity   in the cases where he did not work  objectively or satisfactorily. Admittedly, no such opportunity was  given. Even  when he  acted in  dilemma and lacked objectivity,  in such  circumstances  ,  he  must  be guided by  the authority  as to the manner in which he acted upon. Since  this exercise has been done by the respondents, it would  be obvious  that the  above adverse remark was not consistent with law. Accordingly the appeal is allowed.

" J U D G M E N T We have heard counsel for the parties. It is apparent from our order dated 24th February, 2004 that the only question which remained to be considered was whether the department has charged interest from the year 1993 or from any later date.  Counsel appearing for the appellant had then submitted that though the lottery was declared on 12.11.1993, the prize in the form of a Maruti Car was delivered to the appellant on 8.11.1994 and tax liability arose only thereafter. He was liable to pay tax only in the assessment year 1995-1996 on receipt basis.  Counsel for the Revenue has produced before us instruction received from the office of the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Ludhiana.  The letter dated 24.10.2005 clearly states that the interest under Section 234A, 234B and 234C was not charged from the year 1993 as the consideration received on account of lottery prize was assessed on receipt basis, and not on the declaration of the prize.  Thus, there is no doubt that the interest has been charged on receipt basis and not on the basis of the date of declaration of the prize. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that there may be some error of calculation and in particular, he submitted that the interest, if any, payable under Section 234B was payable from December, 1995 and not from any earlier date, since he received the car as a prize on 8.11.1994. We do not wish to express any considered opinion on this question, since it is always open to the appellant to move the appropriate authority under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act for appropriate order. With the above observation, the civil appeal is dismissed.",The prize in the form of a Maruti Car was delivered to the appellant on 8.11.1994 and tax liability arose only thereafter.

The latter part of the said direction shows that in case of default, the Award amount carries interest @ 18% simple interest per annum from 01.02.1994 till date of actual payment. 7)      On 30.04.1998, learned single Judge of the High Court disposed of Arbitration Petition No. 171 of 1991 by passing the following order: \023In the totality of the circumstances, I order that let award be made rule of the Court and the amounts found due along with interest awarded by the Arbitrator be paid from the date of decree with interest at 18% till final realization of the decretal amount of the petition.

In the light of the controversy, we verified the direction of the Arbitrator and the order passed by the High Court both in the Arbitration and Revision Petition.

All  the  three  appealed to the High Court and their appeal was dismissed. Hardev Singh and Pritam  Kaur  have  now  approached this  Court  challenging  their conviction. What is urged by the learned counsel for the appellants is that the  evidence led  by  the  prosecution to connect the appellants with the murder  of  Nachattar  Singh  is  really  insufficient  and, therefore,  their  conviction  under  Section  302 read with Section 120-B IPC is neither proper nor legal. As pointed out by the High Court, the  evidence  led by  the prosecution agianst the appellants was to the effect that they suspected that Nachatter Singh had killed Joginder Singh, father of appellant No. 1 and  husband  of  appellant No.2 and they wanted to take revenge. On one day in presence of Mukhtiar singh PW-4. Parminder Singh PW-5 and Avtar Singh PW-7  they  declared  that  they  would  take revenge. These witnesses  had  seen  Gurtej  Singh  in  the  house  of  the appellants  and  heard  him  assuring  appellant No.2 not to worry as they were going to show the result. We have gone through the evidence of these witnesses and we find that their  evidence  on  this  point  does  not appear  to  be  reliable.  Their passing by the house of the appellants at the time when  it  was  so  stated  is  rather difficult  to  be accepted. The High Court has not given any good reason for accepting that part of the evidence of these witnesses. Merely from one occasion when prosecution witness Mukhtiar singh had seen Jagdev Singh and Gurtej singh in the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 house of the appellants. It was not proper to  jump  to  the conclusion  that  they  had gone there with a view to assure the appellants that they would take  revenge  by  committing murder  of  Joginder  Singh and the appellants had conspired with them for doing so. In our opinion the  prosecution  has failed  to  connect the appellants with the murder committed by Gurtej Singh and Chamkaur  Singh.  We,  therefore,  allow this  appeal  set aside the conviction of the appellants and acquit them of the charge levelled against them.","Hardev Singh, Pritam Kaur and Paramjit Kaur were found guilty of the murder of Nachattar Singh in pursuance of their conspiracy. Chamkaur Singh and Jagdev Singh were found absconding and their presence could not be obtained at the trial. The trial court believed the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and held that Gurtej Singh committed the murder.",appointment,33.62
" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 354 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The Government in its proceedings no. 20300 dated May 28, 1985 evolved a scheme to accord rehabilitation assistance to the families of a non- government primary school teacher who die or suffer from permanent incapacity while in service. They have prescribed that one member of the family of the deceased or permanently disabled non-government primary school teachers will be eligible for appointment in a class three or class four posts under Government including a post of primary school teacher or as the primary school teacher in a non-government primary school subject to the condition that the member of the family who seeks to avail of this facility possesses the requisite educational qualifications required for the post. If such a person seeks appointment as a primary school teacher whether in a government or in a non-government primary school, he may be appointed as such if he possesses the requisite educational qualifications. If such person does not possess the requisite training qualification, he/she shall be required to acquire the necessary training qualification within a period of three years from the date of appointment as a teacher in a primary school. An untrained person appointed as a primary school teacher would receive pay in the scale applicable to un-trained matriculate till he/she acquires the training qualifications. Clause II further provides that the above facility will be available to one member of the family of the deceased or permanently disabled primary school teacher provided due to the death or permanent disability occurred prior to the period of the normal date of superannuation and not during the period of re-employment or extension of service after retirement. For the purpose of rehabilitation it was initiated to either husband or wife, son or daughter including adopted son or daughter, step son or daughter or dependent brother or sister. Applications for rehabilitation assistance shall be received within a period of five years from the date of death or permanent disability. It is contended that the teacher, father of the respondent, was murdered on September 15, 1984 and the application was made after the scheme has come into force. The scheme has no application to the teachers who died prior to the scheme came into force. The direction given by the Tribunal in OA No, 617/90 dated August 16,1993 is contrary to the scheme since it was not intended for the benefit of dependents of those non-government primary teachers who died or suffered disability prior to this scheme has come into force. We find force in the contention. It states that the facility of rehabilitation to the family of non-government primary school teachers would be given to the teacher who dies or suffers permanent incapacity while in service. In other words, it would be clear that the death of teacher while in service or disability to a teacher should occur after the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 scheme has come into force. Therefore, an application made in compliance with the conditions prescribed therein should be in respect of the teacher who dies or suffer permanent disability after the scheme has come into force. However, since the Tribunal has exercised the discretion and given the benefit to the respondent no. 1 who is also qualified for appointment to the post in class III or class IV or untrained primary school teacher we find it not a fit case for interference. The SLP is accordingly dismissed.","The Government in its proceedings no. 20300 dated May 28, 1985 evolved a scheme to accord rehabilitation assistance to the families of a non-government primary school teacher who die or suffer from permanent incapacity while in service.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Though the  respondent has  been served,  he  does  not appear either  in person  or through counsel. This appeal by special leave  arises from  the order dated 1.3.1990 made by the High Court of Orissa in First Appeal No.252/87. The  notification   under  section  4(1)  of  the  Land Acquisition Act,  1894  was  published  in  the  Gazette  on 25.3.1985 acquiring about 120 decimals of land for extension of  Vidyut  Marg  in  Bhubaneshwar  Municipality.  The  Land Acquisition Officer  passed his  award under  Section 11  on 7.10.1985 awarding  a total  compensation of  a sum  of Rs.1 lakhs. Dissatisfied  therewith, the  respondent  sought  for reference and  also demanded  Rs.2 lakhs  for  the  building constructed thereon.  The reference  Court by  judgment  and decree dated  19.8.1987 awarded compensation @ Rs.1,66,000/- per acre  and other  statutory benefits.  On further appeal, the High  Court enhanced  the compensation in respect of The building from  Rs.10,000/- to  Rs.1 lakh.  Feeling aggrieved with the  enhanced compensation  in respect of the building, this appeal by special leave has been filed. The Division Bench has recorded the finding that though a  sale  was  purported  to  have  been  made  of  the  half constructed building  on  March  30,  1981  for  residential purpose, the  sanction for  the construction of the building from the Municipality was not obtained. The construction was unauthorized.  Nonetheless,  the  High  Court  directed  the payment of  compensation. We  find that  the approach of the High Court  is clearly  illegal. Having recorded the finding that the  respondent had  constructed the  building  without permission of  any authority  and since  the  Government  is entitled to  have the  unauthorized construction demolished, unless the  owner himself  voluntarily demolishes  and takes the value of the building structure as salvage material. the High Court  ought to  have  held  that  the  respondent  had http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 proceeded unauthorisedly in constructing the building having had  the   knowledge  of  the  acquisition.  Therefore,  the authorities   are    not   bound   by   such   construction. Consequently, the  State is not bound to pay compensation of the value of such a building constructed unauthorisedly. The judgment and  order  passed  by  the  High  Court  directing payment of compensation of Rs.90,000/- is clearly illegal. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the reference Court  for a  sum of Rs.10,000/- is upheld and the direction for  payment of  the  balance  amount  stands  set aside. No costs.","The appeal by special leave arises from the order dated 1.3.1990 made by the High Court of Orissa in First Appeal No.252/87.

It was  contended that by the transfer of the cases, the speedy trial  of  the accused has been hampered and that the  order has  been passed in a casual manner.  The writ petition  was dismissed  by  the  High Court holding that  the  petitioner being  an  advocate  had no locus standi  to  challenge  the legality of the order by way of a writ petition. Generally  speaking, a person shall have no locus standi to  file a writ petition if he is not personally affected by the  impugned  order or his fundamental rights have  neither been  directly  or  substantially invaded nor is  there  any imminent danger of such rights being invaded or his acquired interests  have been violated ignoring the applicable rules. The relief under Article 226 of the constitution is based on the  existence  of a right in favour of the person  invoking the jurisdiction.  The exception to the general rule is only in  cases  where the writ applied for is a writ  of  habeas- corpus or quo warranto or filed in public interest.  It is a matter  of prudence, that the court confines the exercise of writ  jurisdiction  to  cases  where legal  wrong  or  legal injuries  caused  to a particular person or his  fundamental rights  are  violated,  and  not   to  entertain  cases   of individual  wrong  or injury at the instance of third  party where there is an effective legal aid organisation which can take  care  of  such cases.  Even in cases filed  in  public interest,  the  court can exercise the writ jurisdiction  at the instance of a third party only when it is shown that the legal  wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is threatened and such person or determined class of persons is, by reason http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 or  poverty,  helplessness  or  disability  or  socially  or economically  disadvantaged position, unable to approach the court for relief. In  the  instant case the petitioner had not  filed  the petition  in  public  interest  and  did  not  disclose  the circumstances  which  prevented  the affected  persons  from approaching the court.  In the discharge of his professional obligations,  the petitioner-advocate is not obliged to file the writ petition on behalf of his clients.  No circumstance was  mentioned in the petition which allegedly incapacitated the affected persons from filing the writ petition.  Section 30  of  the  Advocates  Act, only entitles  an  advocate  to practise the profession of law and not to substitute himself for  his client.  The filing of the writ petition in his own name, being not a part of the professional obligation of the advocate,  the  High Court was justified in  dismissing  the writ  petition  holding  that the petitioner  had  no  locus standi.

" O R D E R Before the  Trial Court  it was  admitted that the suit land measuring  41.5 decimals was homestead land and several houses of phoos (thatch) and tiles were constructed thereon, which were  in occupation  of the plaintiff-respondent since long, even  prior to the gift Ex.1 executed in her favour by her father-in-law.  Since the  parties were  Mohamedans,  an oral gift  by a   father-in-law  to his  daughter-in-law was permissible but  here was  one which  was  written  but  not registered. It  could not,  in any  event, be  said that  in presence thereof  there was  no oral gift. Significantly, it was followed by possession making the gift complete and that is the finding of all the three courts below. The debate  before the  High Court  centered round  the erroneous premise  that the gifted property was agricultural land to  which the provisions of the Bihar Tenancy Act, 1885 as also  the Bihar  Land Reforms (Fixing of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of  Surplus Land)  Act got  attracted. Even  so, taking into  account those   provisions, the High Court came to the  conclusion that  the oral  gift made  by a Mohamedan would prevail over the provisions in the tenancy laws, which required occupancy  rights to  be transferred  by means of a registered deed.  We think  that it  was unnecessary for the High Court  entering into  such controversy  and putting the tenancy laws  at a  disadvantage over  Muslim personal  law. Once it  stood established  that the property in dispute was house-property,  which   included  open   spaces   of   land appurtenant and subservient thereto, to which the plaintiff- respondent was  put in  possession after an oral gift in her favour, that per se should have bee, enough to keep her suit decreed rejecting  the pleas  of  the  defendants-appellants that the  gift was  invalid, making the natural heirs of the deceased owner claim it by inheritance.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Madras, made on 13.9.96 in O.A.  No.1369/93. The  petitioner are  the Permanent  Way Inspectors in  the pay  scale of  Rs.1400-2300/-.  They  had sought the pay scale of Rs.1600-2660/- and when that was not given, they approached the Tribunal which has rejected their claim. Thus, this special leave petition. It  is   their  contention   that  the   Permanent  Way Inspectors, Gr.III,  Permanent Way Mistries and Direct Track Maintenance Mistries  ar separate cadres and are subordinate to the  Petitioners. Therefore,  they are entitled to higher scales of  pay. It is true that, in an earlier batch of four applications by  similarly situated  employees, the  Central Administrative Tribunal, Bangalore Bench has given direction to grant  the pay  scales claimed by them. After the special leave petition  was disposed  of by  this Court and an order was made  in  a  contempt  petition  by  the  Tribunal,  the Government  considered  the  matter  in  the  light  of  the decision  given  by  the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal, Bangalore. On  consideration thereof,  by proceedings  dated July 12, 1991, the Government have stated as under : ""In   obedience   duty   directions issued by  the  Honourable  Central Administrative Tribunal,  Bangalore Bench in  the order  dated  27.7.89 passed in  application  Nos.2029  & 2039 to  2041/1988, is  advised the Ministry of Railway (Railway Board) in consultation  with the  Ministry of  Finance,  which  is  the  nodal ministry  for   deciding   and   on issuance pertaining  to  pay  scale and  relative   aspect  of  Central Government employees  have made due evaluation of  the nature  of  duty and evaluation  of  the  nature  of duty  and   responsibility  of  the PW1’s Grade  III with that of PWM & DTM  on   such  evaluation  of  all http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 aspect it  has been  observed  that Kholder of  the post  of PWI  Grade III performs substantially the same or     similar      duties      and responsibilities   and    therefore there  are   no  circumstances   to revise the  scale  of  pay  of  PWI Grade  III  to  the  scale  of  pay higher than  the one  fixed in  the Railway Services (revised pay) rule 1986  issued   by   the   President pursuant to the recommendation made by the IVth Pay Commission."" This was  accepted by  the Bangalore  Tribunal  in  the contempt  proceedings.   When  the  petitioners  raised  the similar  contention,  the  Tribunal  did  not  accept  their contention. It  is seen that the Government after evaluating the  nature  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  the different sets  of officers  as mentioned in the order, came to the  conclusion that  they perform substantially the same and similar duties and responsibilities and that, therefore, they did  not find  any reason  to revise  the pay scales of Permanent Way  Inspectors, Gr.III to the scale of pay higher than one  fixed by  the Railway  Department in  the  Railway Services (revised  pay) Rules,  1986 as  recommended by  the IVth Pay  Commission. A  representation seems  to have  been made  before   the  Vth  Pay  Commission  and  the  Vth  Pay Commission  has   given  the   report  to   the  Government. Therefore, based  on the submission of the report of the Vth Pay  Commission   and  acceptance  by  the  Government,  the petitioners’ pay  would be looked into. The Tribunal’s order is consistent  with law.  Therefore, it does not warrant any interference. The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.","Petitioner are the Permanent Way Inspectors in the pay scale of Rs.1400-2300/-.

On 23rd February,  1995 an  appeal against  the  order  of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Single Judge,  preferred by  the University, was allowed and the admission of the appellant was cancelled. It  may be  mentioned that  the appellant  had taken a point by  filing a  filing a Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 1188  of 1994 that the letter Patent Appeal filed by the University was   was    not  maintainable,  as  it  was  not supported by  decision or  resolution of  the University nor was it  accompanied   by any  power of attorney on behalf of the  University.  No  separate  order  was  passed  on  this Miscellaneous Application. The  main issue involved in this case has already been discussed in Nitasha Paul’s case [Civil] Appeal No. -------- ---- of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 9776 of 1995) 1. The order  of the  appeal court  has  been  set  aside.  The question now  is to  what relief  is the appellant entitled? The appellant  has stated  that his father is an IAS officer of the  West Bengal  Cadre. He  got admission  in the  North Bengal Dental  College at Siliguri from which he passed both the  first  year  and  the  second  year  examinations.  His application  for   migration  to   D.A.V.  Centenary  Dental College, Yamuna  Nagar, was approved. He claims that he is a resident of Haryana. The appellant  cannot claim  admission to  a college of his own  choice on  the strength  of marks  obtained at  the first year  B.D.S. Examination  conducted  by  North  Bengal University. The  appellant’s prayer  for admission to Dental College at  Rohtak cannot  be allowed.  This order  will not prevent the  appellant from  continuing his studies at North Bengal Dental  College at  Siliguri or, if he is so entitled even now,  to seek  admission to the D.A.V. Centenary Dental College, Yamuna  Nagar, if a vacancy exists. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.",Puneet Sardana was granted admission in the North Bengal College at Siliguri in the B.D.S course. He claims that he is a resident of Haryana and cannot claim admission to his own college on the basis of marks obtained by him.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the division  Bench of  the Punjab  and Haryana  High Court, made on October 1,1996 in CWP No.15380/96. Admittedly, the  petitioner was  promoted on an earlier occasion temporarily, as Assistant Sub Inspector in the year 1988 but  ultimately the  same came to be challenged and was set aside  by an order of this Court. Thereafter, as per the directions of  this court, written examination and interview were conducted.  In the  written examination. the petitioner secured 105  marks . subordinate service selection Board has allotted 75%  of the  marks to  the written  test and 25% of marks to  the interview.  The petitioner  having secured 105 marks, could  not be  selected since he could not make up in the interview.  as many  as 97 candidates were selected. The petitioner having remained unsuccessful, filed writ petition in the  High court  challenging the  selection  process.  He contended  that  since  he  had  previous  experience,  some weightage would  have been  given out  of 25%  marks on  the basis  of   the  previous   experience.  However,  since  no consideration in  that behalf  was given,  the selection was bad in  law, The  High court has pointed out and in our view rightly, that  it is  a competition open to all the persons. By  fortuitous   circumstances  of  the  previous  temporary promotion, separate  marks could  not be  allocated for  the previous service  in which  event such  persons will steal a march over the other candidates in the open competition. The view taken  by the High court is clear, justifiable and well founded.  The   learned  counsel   for  the  petitioner  has contended that  the persons  who secured 80 marks in written examination have  been selected by granting full 25 % of the marks while  the petitioner  who secured  105 marks  in  the written examination  could not  be selected by being awarded some out  of 25  marks. As  a consequence,  the selection is arbitrary. The  learned counsel seeks to place before us the list of  such candidates  who secured 80 marks, said to have been published by the Board. Since the document had not been made part  of the  record in  the High Court, we cannot look into the document. It is not the case of the petitioner that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 he had  raised this  point in  the High  court and  the High court has  failed to  consider it  . On  the other hand, the High Court has pointed out thus: ""Records now  before us  show  that the petitioner  did not  do  fairly wall  to  get  high  marks  at  the interview.  consequently,   persons who  got   similar  marks  as  that secured by  the petitioner  in  the written test,  got higher  rank  by virtue of the marks secured by them at  the  interview.  Marks  in  the written  test  together  with  that obtained at  the interview  decided the rank in the select list."" It indicates  that the  High court  has considered  the record of  the selection  Board  placed  before  it  and  on comparative  evaluation   of  the   candidates  who  secured combined marks  in the  written  test  as  well  as  in  the interview, 97  candidates were  selected on the basis of the merit, the  High court has pointed out that no allegation of mala fides  or arbitrariness  of selection  was made.  Under these circumstances,  we do  not find  any illegality in the judgment of the High court warranting interference. The special leave petition is dismissed.","The special leave petition arises from the judgment of the division  Bench of the Punjab  and Haryana High Court, made on October 1,1996 in CWP No.15380/96.

We have also perused the judgment in these appeals and also the appointment order and other relevant records.  The appointment order appointing the respective respondents herein clearly show that the respondents were appointed in the prescribed scale on temporary basis for the academic year ending on 31st March, 1993 and subject to the approval by the Education Department.  The appointment order further states that the services of the temporary employees may be terminated by the management at any time without assigning any reason and without giving any prior notice.  This appointment order was issued to Y.D.Deshpande (respondent No.1 in SLP(C) No.16412/2005).  Another appointment order was issued by the management pursuant to the Resolution of the management in its meeting dt.11.08.1991.  The respondent No.1 in SLP(C) No.16418/2005 (S.K.Joshi) was appointed as Assistant Teacher in the school in question on consolidated salary of Rs.400/- per month and on contract basis.  The appointment order also further states that the appointment was upto the end of academic year 10.4.1992.  It is not in dispute that when the approval of the Government was sought the Government did not approve the appointment for the additional post.  It is also not in dispute that the appellants’ institution    is run on the basis of grant-in-aid by the Government.  The services of the respondents were terminated in the year 2001 and the respondents without http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 availing the alternative remedy available under the law straightway filed the Writ Petitions in the High Court which were allowed by the learned Single Judge and also on appeal by the management the same was affirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court. It is now well-settled principle of law that the appointment made on probation/ad hoc basis for a specific period of time comes to an end by efflux of time and the person holding such post can have no right to continue on the post.  In the instant case as noticed above, the respective respondents have accepted the appointment including the terms and conditions stipulated in the appointment orders and joined the posts in question and continued on the said post for some years.  The respondents having accepted the terms and conditions stipulated in the appointment order and allowed the period for which they were appointed to have been elapsed by efflux of time, they are not now permitted to turn their back and say that their  appointments could not be terminated on the basis of their appointment letters nor they could be treated as temporary employee or on contract basis.  The submission made by the learned counsel for the respondents to the said effect has no merit and is, therefore, liable to be rejected.  It is also well-settled law by several other decisions of this Court that appointment on ad hoc basis/temporary basis comes to an end by efflux of time and persons holding such post have no right to continue on the post and ask for regularisation  etc. For the foregoing reasons, the Civil Appeals stand  allowed and the judgments passed by the High Court in Writ Appeal Nos.2807/2002  and 2808/2002 and in Writ Petitions are set aside.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Appellant calls in question legality of the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court, dismissing the application filed by the appellant for extension of time to comply with the earlier order dated 25.6.1999. A brief reference to the factual aspects would suffice: Appellant filed Misc. First appeal under Order XLIII Rule 1(r )  of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the ’Code’) against order dated 30.5.1997 passed by the learned Civil Judge Puttur (D.K.) dismissing petition filed under Order IX Rule 13 read with Order XVII Rule 2 of the Code for restoration of the suit which had been decreed ex-parte. Appellant was defendant No. 5 in the suit. By order dated 25.6.1999 the learned Single Judge allowed the appeal, inter-alia, with the following directions: ""In the result, the appeal is allowed on payment of cost of Rs.1,000/-.  The impugned order is set aside.  The appellant is directed to file the written statement within 2 weeks from the date of this order and the trial court shall dispose of the suit within 3 months from the date of receipt of this order, after framing necessary issues."" It is the case of the appellant that his advocate on 30.6.1999 wrongly informed him that the written statement was to be filed within two months and the cost was to be paid within the said time.  The written statement was tendered on 2.8.1999 and cost was offered to the learned counsel for the plaintiffs.  The said learned counsel refused to accept the amount on the ground that the same was offered after the due date. Appellant filed a memo before the Civil Judge for accepting the deposit. However, the learned Civil Judge called for the records of the original suit no. 17/1995 and directed that the deposit can be made only after receipt of the records. On going through the certified copies, the appellant noticed that actual time granted was two weeks and not two months. He, therefore, made an application before the High Court to extend the time. The same has been rejected by the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 following order: OFFICE NOTE ""I.A. II for extension of time Advocate for appellant has filed an I.A. and affidavit praying to extend the time set for filing of the written statement and payment of cost by 2 months for the reasons stated in the I.A.  Post I.A II for orders before S.J. Orders of Court Heard. IA 2 is dismissed."" Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that because of the bona fide mistake the directions of the High Court could not be complied with and the fact that the written statement was tendered and the cost offered within two months proves the bona fides.  The High Court without indicating any reason has dismissed the application. There is no appearance on behalf of the respondents in spite of service of notice. We find that the appellant had indicated sufficient reasons as to why there was non- compliance with the order of the High Court.  The bona fides have been spelt out in detail and, in fact, there was no reply denying  the averments made by the plaintiff who was the opposite party no. 1 in the application. That being so, the High Court was not justified in summarily rejecting the application.  Therefore, we set aside the order of the High Court.  Let the written statement be filed within four weeks from today, if not already filed on record of the trial court.  The costs shall be paid within the aforesaid time. If the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled the order dated 25.6.1999 in MFA No. 2323 of 1997 shall be treated to be operative. The appeal is allowed with no order as to  costs.","Appellant calls in question legality of the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court, dismissing the application filed by the appellant for extension of time to comply with the earlier order.",appointment,47.14
" O R D E R Leave granted. The appellant entered Railway service as Shunting Porter on April 26, 1955. It would appear from the service record that his date of birth was declared to be January 22, 1926. On January 7, 1984, the appellant was informed that he was to retire on January 31, 1984 (A.N.), since he attained the superannuation on January 21, 1984. Thereon, the appellant gave a reply stating that his date of birth was January 22, 1936 and that therefore the order of retirement is not correct. Accordingly, he approached the High Court by filing Writ Petition No.CWJC No.353 of 1984 which was transferred to the Tribunal. The Tribunal rejected the said writ petition holding that the Union of India was not a party. Then he filed O.A. No.306 of 1989. The Tribunal by order dated April 4, 1990 dismissed the application on the ground of res judicata. Thus this appeal by special leave. The contention of the appellant supported by Shri Sanyal, learned senior counsel, is that the appellant had declared his date of birth as January 22, 1936 which could be reflective from the periodical medical inspection reports made by the authorities which noted that his date of birth. The respondents have deliberately withheld the documents and that, therefore, the appellant is entitled to the declaration that he is not liable to retire until he attains the superannuation age of 58 years. The respondents stated before the Tribunal in the first instance that the record was required to be produced in the High Court and one Mr. P.C. Ghose, D.S.(G) was entrusted with the record to meet their Advocate, Mr. A.B. Ojha. According to the endorsement made by the Sr.D.P.O. on November 29, 1988 the S.R. of the appellant together with the file was taken by Mr. P.C. Ghose to meet Mr. A.B. Ojha, their Advocate in connection with the case laid by the appllant. When that was required back by letter dated http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 December 23, 1988, the Advocated had stated that ""no such paper was with him"". Under those circumstances, it was explained that the file relating to the service record of the appellant was missing. It was also stated by the Tribunal in the earlier proceedings that the definite stand taken by the respondents was that the record was manipulated and service register was removed from record by the appellant in connivance with the Officer Superintendent (G). It would thereby appear that the service record of the appellant with the respondents is not available. The only question now is whether the appellant is liable to retire on attaining the superannuation on January 21, 1984 as contended by the Department or is entitled to remain in service for 10 more years treating his date of birth to be January 22, 1936. In view of state of record and paucity of the authentic material on record, we find it difficult to place implicit reliance on the contention of the appellant. The Tribunal, therefore, was right in dismissing the petition, though for different reasons. Under these circumstances, we cannot give any relief to the appellant. The appeal is therefore, dismissed. No costs.","The appellant entered Railway service as Shunting Porter on April 26, 1955. It would appear from the service record that his date of birth was declared to be January 22, 1926.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NOS.7122-7124 OF 2002 M/s.Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd., respondent No.1 herein (hereinafter referred to as the ’respondent’) is a manufacturer of wiring harnesses.  The manufacture is carried out accordi ng to specific orders of automotive and air conditioning industry, against specific contracts. In some cases the appellant received certain component parts of wiring harness, free of charge, from their buyers. These components were also incorporated in the wiring harness.  In such cases, the value of the free supply component parts were not added to the price of wiring harnesses while fixing their assessable value and paying excise duty on them. Appellant searched the premises of the respondent and came to know that the respondent was not paying duty on the free supplies received by it from their buyers and thus suppressed the informati on with the intention to evade payment of duty. Consequently, a show cause notice was issued proposing to demand duty of Rs.96,01,56 1/- for the period from March, 1995 to January, 1997 on clearance of wiring harness by the respondent.  The show cause notice also sought to invoke the extended period of limitation under Section 11A of the Central Excise & Salt Act, 1944.  Reply to show cause notice was also filed. By his order dated 27th February, 2001, Commissioner confirmed the demanded duty and also imposed a penalty of the same amount and further penalty of Rs.5 lacs and Rs.7 lacs on the Managing Director and DGM(Marketing) of the respondent’s company.

O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted . Heard learned counsel for both sides. This  appeal   by  special  leave  arises  against  the judgment and  order of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana in Civil Revision No. 3319 of 1992 dated January 21, 1993. A  notification   under  Section   4(1)  of   the  Land Acquisition Act,  1894 (Act 1 of 1894) (hereinafter referred to as  the ’Act’)  was published  on November  4, 1997.  The Land Acquisition  Collector in  his award made under Section 11 of  the act  on October  28, 1981 awarded compensation at the rate  of Rs. 30,000/- per acre.  Dissatisfied therewith, the respondents  filed application  under Section  18 of the act.   The Additional  District Judge by his ward and decree dated April  6, 1985 awarded compensation at the rate of Rs. 18/- per  square yard.   The  respondents  levied  execution regarding recovery  of the  amount on  October 12, 1992. The District Judge  by his  order dated  July 18,  1992  awarded additional amount  under Section 23(1-A) of the Act and also enhanced the  interest under  Section 28  of the  Act at the rate of  9 per  cent per annum for the first year and 15 per cent per annum thereafter till the date of realisation.  The appellant carried  the matter in revision but the High Court dismissed the revision.  Thus this appeal by special leave. It  has  been  well-settled  legal  position  that  the claimant is  not entitled to payment of additional amount of compensation  under   section   23(1-A)   when   the   award proceedings  have   been  concluded   long  prior   to   the introduction of the Amendment Act 68 of 1984.  It is settled by catena  of decisions  of this  Court that  the  executing Court  is   devoid  of   jurisdiction  and  power  to  award additional amount of compensation or to enhance the interest in execution.   The  Court gets  power and  jurisdiction  on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reference when  it enhances  compensation or on appeal under Section 54  enhances the  compensation to  award  additional amount of  compensation under Section 23(1-A) or solatium at 30% under  Section 23(2)  or interest under Section 28 under Amendment Act  68 of  1984.  The executing Court, therefore, travelled beyond its jurisdiction to award additional amount under Section  23(1-A) and also interest under Section 28 of the Act.   The  High Court was, therefore, in clear error in dismissing the  civil revision.   The  amended decree of the execution Court stands set aside. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

" J U D G M E N T HANSARAI, J. Leave granted. 2.   The dispute  at hand  relates to  property bearing door Nos.297 to 306 which once belonged to one M.Abdul Sattar and his vounder  brother M.Sattar. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein are the  daughters of  M.Sattar through  his first wife, the third respondent.  The two  appellants claimed themselves to be the  offspring of  M.Sattar through his second wife. They challenged a  deed of  settlement by  the aforesaid  Sattars relating to the property in favour of respondent Nos.1 and 2 on  the   ground  that   the  same   had  been  obtained  by misrepresentation, fraud  and coercion.  After the  death of both the Sattars, the appellants filed a suit in the file of Court of  Subordinate Judge,  Coimbatore, claiming that they were entitled  to 53  and 1/2  out of  72 shares  and  mesne profits. Respondents’  case  was  that  the  appellants  are illegitimate children  of M.Sattar,  and so, not entitled to any share;  and the  settlement deed  was valid.  The  trial court decreed  the  suit,  but  on  appeal  the  High  Court dismissed the  same holding  that the  appellants  were  not legitimate children  of M.Sattar and the settlement deed was valid. 3.   Shri Mohan,  learned counsel  for the  appellants,  has strenuously  urged  that  the  finding  of  the  High  Court relating to  legitimacy is  untenable inasmuch  as the Court gave undue  importance to  Exhibit A.9,  which is  a copy of marriage register containing recital of marriage of M.Sattar and his  second wife stating ""I affirm that this date I have married"".(Emphasis supplied). Shri Mohan contends that apart from this  exhibit, which is dated 26.8.1967, there are many documents to  show that  M.Sattar had acknowledged paternity prior  to   that  date.   It   is   submitted   that   these acknowledgements were  not viewed  in proper  perspective by the High Court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 4.   We  have   felt  inclined   to  accept   the  aforesaid submission of  Shri Mohan  keeping  in  view  the  principle underlying section 112 of the Evidence Act and what has been stated in  section 114.  These two  sections  give  rise  to presumption  against   concubinage  and  permit  raising  of presumption of  legitimacy of  the children  born during the period of  continuous cohabitation.  Shri Nariman, appearing for the  respondents, has  no objection  to our holding that the  appellants   are  legitimate   offspring  of  M.Sattar, provided interest of his clients is adequately protected qua other properties  of the  two Sattars.  We, therefore, state that the  appellants would be accepted, taken and treated as legitimate children of M.Sattar. 5.   On the  question relating  to validity  or otherwise of the settlement  deed, we find no reason to disagree with the High  Court,   as,  whether   the  deed   was  obtained   by misrepresentation, fraud  and coercion is a question of fact which has  been thoroughly  gone into by the High Court with reference to  the materials on record. We, therefore, uphold the finding  of the  High Court  qua  the  validity  of  the settlement deed. 6.   It appears  to us  that to  do complete justice between the parties  it would  be apposite  to state that as we have decided  the   question  of   legitimacy  on  the  basis  of presumption, it  should be  made clear  that the  appellants would not  lay any  claim in respect of any property left by M.Sattar and/or  Abdul Sattar  on the basis of what has been held by us relating to the legitimacy of the two appellants; and we say so. 7.   The appeal  is allowed  accordingly with no order as to costs.","The dispute  at hand relates to property bearing door Nos.297 to 306 which once belonged to one M.Abdul Sattar and his vounder  brother M.Sattar.

After the approved route was published under section 68D(3), a scheme  was framed  under which  unemployed graduates were permitted under  ""self employment  scheme""  to  operate  the stage carriages  and conditions.  It would  appear  that  to certain terms  and conditions.  It  would  appear  that  the appellants did not comply with the said terms and conditions as a  result of  which their  permits were  cancelled by the authorities Calling  the action  in question  the appellants filed a  writ petition The High Court has dismissed the said writ petition. Thus this appeal by special leave. The controversy  is longer  res integra.  It is settled legal position  that once  notification under subsection (3) of section  68-D of the Act is published in the Gazette, all the pre-existing  operators shall  cease to  operate on  the frozen routes  except  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and conditions mentioned  in the  scheme itself  which is law by itself.

In  this   case,  admittedly   the  state   Road   Transport Corporation had  the permits  Obtained and  that  therefore, under the  notified scheme  no one  except  the  state  Road Transport  Corporation   shall  exclusively  ply  the  stage carriages on  the notified  route in  terms  of  the  scheme itself.

State Road Transport Corporation & Ors. etc.(1987)1 SCC  13)  Considered  this  aspect  of  the  matter  and  in paragraph 3 Of the  judgment it  was help  that it  is  not  ,  however, permissible under  the Act  for the  Corporation to obtain a permissible under  the Act  for the  Corporation to obtain a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 permit under  Chapter IV-A  of Act  and to  allow a  Private operator as  its nominee  to operate  under that  permit his motor Vehicle  as a stage Carriage on the notified route. It cannot be  granted permission to collect any money either as nomination fees  or as  royalty or supervision charges. Thus it would  be seen  that  in  a  notified  route  no  private operator is entitled to ply the stage carriage.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. This special  leave petition has been filed against the judgment of the High Court of Madras, made on May 7, 1996 in CRP No. 46-96. Admittedly, the petitioner’s mother had filed an application  under Order  XXI, Rule  64, CPC to set aside the execution  of sale  of  two  items  of  properties.  The petition ultimately  came to  be dismissed and became final. After he  demise, the  petitioner  filed  application  under Section 47 of the CPC contending that the property could not be brought  to sale  for several reasons. In the High Court, one of  the grounds raised was that the properties were sold for  a  grossly  inadequate  price  and  sale  of  both  the properties was  excessive execution.  It was stated that the decree was  only  for  a  sum  of  Rs.  10,000/-  while  two properties valuing  Rs. 40,000/-  and another Rs. 1,00,000/- have been brought to sale and, therefore, they are in excess of the  decree in execution. The High Court has negative the contention on  the  ground  that  since  the  title  of  the petitioner had  been negatived  on earlier  occasion and had become final,  it could  not be  gone  into  for  the  third occasion Even  though the petitioner had one-sixth share, as contended, in  view of the prohibition contained under Order 21, Rule  93, CPC  and since  objection in  respect  of  the excessive execution  was not  raised before the proclamation was settled  the objection  cannot be  countenanced. Shri B. Kanta Rao,  learned counsel for the petitioner contends that in view of Section 47 of the CPC, the petitioner is entitled to raise the objection at any stage and, therefore, the view taken by  the High  Court is  not correct in law. We find no force in  the contention.  Section 47  postulates  that  all questions arising  between the  parties to the suit in which the  decree   was  passed,  or  their  representatives,  and relating to  the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree, shall  be determined  by  the  Court  executing  the decree and  not by  a separate  suit.  Explanation  1  added thereto by  Amendment Act,  1976  postulates  that  for  the purposes of  this section,  a plaintiff  whose suit has been dismissed and  a defendant  against whom  a  suit  has  been dismissed, are  parties to  the  suit.  The  opportunity  to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 object to  executability of  the decree  could be taken only once and  repeated applications appear to be unwarranted. It is not  in dispute  that  petitioner’s  mother  had  already agitated the right title to the property and claimed that to the extent of her right, the execution was not valid in law. That right  having been  negatived  and  become  final,  the petitioner cannot  have any  higher right  than  the  mother herself had.  The petitioner  having allowed  the orders  to become final,  it would not be open to the petition to raise the contentions  thereafter. Even otherwise also, as held by the High Court, the objection as to excess execution has not been raised.  Though Order  21, Rule  90(3), CPC  may not be strictly construed  so as  to the put a fetter on the Court, due to  non-raising of  the objection before proclamation of sale and  the objection  could be  raised even  at  a  later stage, but  since the  title has  already been  lost and has become   final,    the   petitioner   cannot   agitate   the executability of  the decree  in the  absence of  any  legal title to  question the  correctness of  the execution. Under these circumstances,  we do  not  think  that  we  would  be justified to  exercise the  power under  Article 136  of the Constitution. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner’s mother had filed an application  under Order  XXI, Rule  64, CPC to set aside the execution of sale of two  items of properties.

" JUDGMENT S.B. SINHA, J. : 1. Leave Granted. 2. Respondent herein was appointed as a Lineman in the Punjab State Electricity Board. He was appointed on the basis of a purported experience certificate produced by him. A vigilance enquiry was made in regard to the genuiness thereof. However, before a regular departmental proceeding could be initiated, the respondent made a representation to the Administrative Member of the Appellant-Board on 15.6.2001, alleging that as he had been appointed long time back and despite the fact that he had submitted original certificates as demanded of him, he had not been given promotion and other financial benefits. The Administrative Member of the appellant- Board directed that the services of the respondent should be allowed to be continued after deducting one year’s service. The said order is said to have been acted upon. 3. However, the Chairman of the appellant-Board having come across a similar problem in the case of another employee, directed the matter to be placed before the entire Board. It was decided that the services of similarly placed employees should be terminated apart from the employee concerned. Pursuant to the said decision, the services of the respondent herein was also terminated. The validity of the said order came to be questioned by the respondent by filing a writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court which by reason of the impugned judgment and order dated 17.8.2005 has been allowed opinion that in view of the fact the respondent had already suffered one punishment and his name having not found place in Memorandum No. 12 dated 16.7.2002 he should be directed to be reinstated in service with all consequential benefits. The appellant- Board is thus before us. 4. The short question which arises for consideration is whether in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case the Board could terminate the services of the respondent. 5. The charge against the respondent is that he has committed fraud in obtaining the appointment by production of a forged experience certificate. The said charge, in our considered opinion, was required to be proved in a duly constituted departmental proceeding. The services of the appellant could not have been directed to be terminated relying on and/or on the basis of the decision of the Board in the case of another employee. 6. We, therefore, are of the opinion that interest of justice will be subserved if the appellant-Board is directed to initiate a departmental proceeding against the respondent herein. 7. We are, however, not oblivious of the fact that the order dated http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 15.6.2001 of the Administrative Member of the appellant-Board has been given effect to. We, therefore, in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, set aside the order passed by the Administrative Member of the appellant-Board also having regard to the fact that the Administrative member of the appellant-Board alone could not have issued the same. This order is being passed in view of the well settled principles of law that if by reason of setting aside an illegal order, any other illegality is revived, the Court would be entitled to quash both the orders. 8. For the reasons aforementioned, while setting aside the order of termination passed as against the respondent, we also set aside the order dated 15.6.2001 passed by the Administrative Member of the appellant-Board upon giving liberty to the appellant-Board to initiate a full-fledged departmental proceedings against the respondent. The respondent may be reinstated in service but he may be placed under suspension. Appellant shall refund the amount which has been deducted from respondent’s salary pursuant to the aforementioned order passed by the Administrative Member of the appellant-Board in the meanwhile. The appeal is allowed with the aforementioned direction.","S.B.
