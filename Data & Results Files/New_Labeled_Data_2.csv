" O R D E R Leave granted. While we are hearing the matter on the procedural part of listing for admission of the writ petitions filed under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India in Bombay High Court, Mr. Anil B. Diwan, learned senior counsel for the respondents, has stated that a direction may be given to place this matter before the Division Bench for disposal. We think that the appropriate course would be that the matter may be placed before the Division Bench. The learned, Chief Justice of the High Court is requested to place the matter before the Division Bench presided over by him or some other Bench for final disposal. We are informed that against the suit for specific performance decreed by the Civil Judge, City Civil Court F.A. No.869/92 has been filed and the Court has  directed that the appeal also may be tagged along with the writ Petition. We are informed that the matter has already been tagged with the writ petition. In that view of the matter, it would be expedient that both the matters may be disposed of together by the Division Bench. We are informed that the respondents are also anxious to have the matter disposed of. Under these  circumstances, we request the High Court have the  matters disposed of as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of this order. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.","The matter was listed for admission of writ petitions filed under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India in Bombay High Court.

" Santosh Hegde, J. These appeals are against the judgment and order dated 19.4.1983  passed  by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana  in Civil  Writ  Petition  Nos.2621  and   2622  of  1976.   The appellant  who  was  the petitioner before the  High  Court, filed the aforesaid writ petitions challenging an order made by   the  second  respondent   herein  appointing  the   3rd respondent  as  an  arbitrator under the provisions  of  the Punjab Cooperative Societies Act, 1961 (for short the Act) which  petitions  came to be dismissed by the Full Bench  of the  High Court, following an earlier Full Bench judgment of the  same  High Court which is since reported as Mam Raj  v. State of Haryana & Ors.  (AIR 1982 P & H 211). In  these  appeals, it is contended by  the  appellant that  the provisions of Section 55(1)(b) of the Act are  not applicable  with  regard to any dispute arising  between  an employee  of  a Cooperative Society and another  Cooperative Society  and  the dispute in the instant case being  between Shahbad  Farm  Cooperative Marketing cum Processing  Society Ltd.   (for  short the Shahbad Society) and an employee  of Nalvi  Cooperative  Agricultural Service Society (for  short the  Nalvi  Society),  such dispute could  not  have  been referred to an arbitrator under the provisions of the Act. In support of his contention, the appellant has sought to  place  reliance  on a judgment of this Court  in  Deccan Merchants Co-operative Bank Ltd.  v.  M/s.  Dalichand Jugraj Jain  &  Ors.  (1969 1 SCR 887).  In our opinion, the  ratio laid  down  in  the said judgment is not applicable  to  the facts  of  this  case.   The dispute in  that  case  was  in relation  to a property leased by a member of the Society to the  Society  and  the question was whether such  a  dispute comes  under the purview of the arbitration clause  provided for  in  the  Act.  There, it was held by  this  Court  that though  the  person who leased the property to the  Society, was  a member of the Society, the nature of the dispute  was such  that it did not pertain to the management and business of  the  Cooperative  Society.   In the  instant  case,  the appellant  though  was  employed by the Nalvi Society  as  a salesman was, in fact, a member of the Shahbad Society.  The dispute  in  question  was  with   reference  to  an  amount collected  by the appellant which was payable to the Shahbad http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Society.   Therefore,  the claim of the Shahbad  Society  is certainly  the one pertaining to the management and business of  the  Shahbad  Society.  Therefore, in our  opinion,  the dispute  squarely falls within Section 55 of the Act.  It is unfortunate that the appellant in his special leave petition did  not  disclose  this fact that he was a  member  of  the Shahbad  Society.  On the contrary, he had only  highlighted the  fact that he was an employee of the Nalvi Society  and, as  such,  the dispute between him and the  Shahbad  Society could  not  come  under Section 55 of the Act.  It  is  only after  a counter was filed on behalf of the Shahbad  Society that  it  has  come on record that the appellant is  also  a member  of the Shahbad Society.  To this extent it should be said  that  the  appellant  was not fair to  this  Court  in presenting  his  case.  It has also come on record that  the arbitrator has already passed an award against the appellant and it is only by virtue of the interim order passed by this Court  that that award is not yet executed.  At any rate, we having  come to the conclusion that in view of the fact that the  appellant  is a member of the Shahbad Society and as  a member  any  amount due from him to the Society, would  come within  the  purview  of  the   dispute  touching  upon  the management and business of the Society.  We find no merit in these appeals and the same are dismissed with costs.","High Court of Punjab & Haryana dismisses appeals against order appointing arbitrator under Punjab Cooperative Societies Act, 1961.

The dispute was in relation to a property leased by a member of the Society.",special leave petitions,29.81
" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not placed in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No.50, Sector-21, Gurgaon, on 19th May, 1986.  All payments were made, but the possession was not given as the plot was under litigation and development work could not take place.  On 20th May 1997, the Respondent was offered an alternate plot No.20 in Sector-5, Gurgaon, but at an enhanced price.  The Respondent agrees to take the alternate plot and files a complaint challenging the enhancement of price. The District Forum directs payment of interest @ 10% after two years from the date of deposit till possession is given and directs that the alternate plot must be delivered at the original price.  The District Forum also directs that if there has been enhancement in the price of the original plot then such enhancement could be collected but no interest could be charged on this enhanced amount. The State Commission dismissed the Appeal filed by the Appellants.  The National Commission dismissed the revision on the ground of delay of 63 days. In this case, the possession has already been taken by the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Respondent.  Interest @ 10% has also been paid on 31st July 2003. Thus, even though we do not approve of the National Commission dismissing the revision for a mere delay of 63 days, in our view, no useful purpose would be served in remitting the matter back.  In our view, the Order of the District Forum is just and has to be maintained. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as it has been passed by taking into account special features of the case.  The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases. Accordingly, we dismiss the Appeal with no order as to costs.",A large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

" J U D G M E N T Shah, J. I am in respectful agreement with the reasons recorded by learned brother Pasayat, J. in arriving at the conclusion that the review petitions are required to be dismissed.  Still however, I record my dissent with regard to sentence aspect. R.P. (Crl.) No.497 of 2002 In W.P. (Crl.) No.993 of 2001. In this case, it is to be stated that I had arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution case depends solely upon the confessional statement.  The reasons recorded therein for acquitting him are not required to be reiterated.  However, considering the majority view also, in my opinion, if death sentence is altered to imprisonment for life, it would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice. R.P. (Crl.) Nos.626 and 627 of 2002 In Crl. A. No.761 of 2001. In this case, it is to be stated that appeal of the main accused Bihari Manjhi and others was allowed and were acquitted on the basis that there was no other evidence except the so-called confessional statement which was totally unreliable and faulty investigation  This is also a fit case for altering the death sentence and imposing sentence of imprisonment for life. For this purpose, I would rely upon the dissent noted by Thomas, J. in Suthendraraja alias Suthenthira Raja alias Santhan and others v. State [(1999) 9 SCC 323) which is reproduced hereunder: ""17.    The Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1980) 2 SCC 684] has narrowed down the scope for awarding death sentence to the extremely restricted radius of ""rarest of rare cases"" in which the alternative lesser sentence of imprisonment for life is unquestionably foreclosed.  In the main judgment in the present case one of the three Judges found that sentence of imprisonment for life would be sufficient to meet the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ends of justice as far A-1 Nalini. 18.     In a case where a Bench of three Judges delivered judgment in which the opinion of at least one Judge is in favour of preferring imprisonment for life to death penalty as for any particular accused, I think it would be a proper premise for the Bench to review the order of sentence of death in respect of that accused. Such an approach is consistent with Article 21 of the Constitution as it helps saving a human life from the gallows and at the same time putting the guilty accused behind the bars for life.  In my opinion, it would be a sound proposition to make a precedent that when one of the three Judges refrains from awarding death penalty to an accused on stated reasons in preference to the sentence of life imprisonment that fact can be regarded sufficient to treat the case as not falling within the narrowed ambit of ""rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed"". In the result, in my opinion, Review Petition (Crl.) No.497 of 2002 filed by Devender Pal Singh in Crl. Appeal No.993 of 2001; Review Petition (Crl.) No.626 of 2002 filed by Dharmendra Singh @ Dharu Singh in Criminal Appeal No.761 of 2001 and Review Petition (Crl.)

" B.N.AGRAWAL, J. Leave granted. Judgment impugned in this appeal has been rendered by Jodhpur Bench of the R ajasthan High Court whereby criminal appeal preferred by the appellants has been dismissed confirming the convictions and sentences awarded against the appellants by the trial court under Sections 3 26 and 325 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The said criminal appeal was filed in the year 1987 and duly admitted.  The same was placed for hearing in the year 2001 and after hearing the parties, the High Court passed an order in four pages.  The impugned judgment, runs into seven paragraphs and after referring to the prosecu tion case  and defence version in paras 1 to 5, the Court has disposed of the appeal in two paragraphs whic h run thus:- ""6.     After re-appreciation of the evidence and re-scrutiny of the record, I find that there is no error apparent in the finding recorded by the learned Judge, therefore, there is no reason to interfere in the order of conviction passed by the learned Judge. 7.      In the result, therefore, the present appeal is dismissed."" The impugned judgment has been challenged on the sole ground that the High Court has not disposed of the appeal in the manner postulated under law inasmuch as it does not appear from the impugned judgment as to how many witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution and on what point.  The High Court has not even referred to any evidence much less considered the same.  In our view, it is a novel method of disposal of criminal appeal against conviction by simply saying that after re-appreciation of the evidence and re-scrutiny of the records, the Court did not find any error apparent in the finding of the trial court even without reappraising the evidence.  In our view, the procedure adopted by the High Court is unknown to law.  It is well settled that in a criminal appeal, a duty is enjoined upon the appellate court to reappraise the evidence itself and it cannot proceed to dispose of the appeal upon appraisal of evidence by the trial court alone especially when the appeal http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 has been already admitted and placed for final hearing.  Upholding such a procedure would amount to negation of valuable right of appeal of an accused which cannot be permitted under law.  Thus, we are of the view that on this ground alone, the impugned order is fit to be set aside and the matter remitted to the High Court. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside and the matter is remitted to that Court for disposal of the appeal in accordance with law a fter giving opportunity of hearing to the parties. .J.

We have heard the learned counsel on both sides. In the  appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.15356/92 dated February 26,  1996, the  Division Bench of the High Court in W.P.2333/1983 by order dated July 29, 1991 directed that the appellants cannot  insist upon  the respondents conceding to the title  of the  Government.

In  the appeal,  this Court had held that for obtaining  licence/renewal, title  to the  property or a lease from  the owner  is a  pre-condition In that case, the Deputy Collector  had held  that the respondent had title to the property  and appeal  thereon was  pending.  Accordingly this Court  had directed  the appellant  to grant renewal of the licence pending decision on title.

" J U D G M E N T S.C. AGRAWAL. J.: Leave granted. The appellant  was appointed  as Registration  Clerk on daily wage  basis on  September 18,  1986 in  the office  of District Registrar,  Allahabad district,  Uttar Pradesh.  He had worked  as Registration  Clerk for  various periods from time to  time from  September 18, 1986 till July 1, 1990. On June 30, 1988 he applied for appointment on the post of Peon which had fallen vacant on retirement of Inamul Haque and on July 2,  1990 he  was appointed  on the said post of Peon on the  pay   scale  of  Rs.  750-940.  The  appellant  made  a representation on February 4, 1991 for regularisation of his service and  the said  representation was  forwarded by  the District Registrar  to the Inspector General of Registration on February  21, 1991  wherein the  District  Registrar  had recommended that  the service period of the appellant may be extended. Inspite of the said recommendation the appointment of the  appellant was  discontinued after February 28, 1991. The appellant filed a Writ Petition which has been dismissed by the  High Court  alongwith other writ petitions by common judgment dated February 8, 1995. The grievance  of the  appellant is  that his  case was wrongly  connected  with  other  matters  which  related  to Registration Clerks  on daily  wage basis  while the case of the appellant  related to  his continuation  on the  post of Peon on which post he was appointed on ad hoc basis by order dated July  2, 1990. We find merit in the said contention of the  appellant.   Since  the  writ  petition  filed  by  the appellant related  to continuance  of his appointment on the post of  Peon and not on the post of Registration Clerks and the appellant  was holding the post of Peon and not the post of Registration  Clerks, his  writ  petition  could  not  be linked with  the writ  petitions and  special appeals of the Registration Clerks  employed on daily wage basis. The order http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the  High Court  dismissing  the  writ  petition  of  the appellant cannot, therefore, be upheld. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed and the judgment of the High  Court dated  February 8,  1995 in  so  far  as  it relates to  dismissal of  the writ petition No. 8351 of 1991 filed by  the appellant,  is set  aside and  the  said  writ petition is  restored and  it is  remanded to the High Court for consideration on merits.

Kashinath Kher  & Ors. [(1996) 8 SCC 762]. The substratumof thepetitioners is that despite specific directions given  and  positive observations  made  in the Judgment, the  respondents havenot implementedthe judgment in itstrue spirit  and purport.   Onthe other hand,they have put  up the  same interpretation of the  provisions set up prior  to the  judgment as  an excuse  in promoting the officers, violating  the judgment.    Shri  Shanti  Bhushan, learnedsenior  counsel  appearing  for  therespondents, learnedseniorcounselappearing  for the  respondents, has stated for  thepurpose of promotion from MMG Scale IIII to MMG Scale  II and  so on,  as per  thenorms,five  years’ confidential reports  and six  years’ appraisal reports are necessarily tobe taken into consideration,  Recording the C.Rs.  after a lapse of15 years would be an impossibletask since the  officers who had observed  the conduct   of the officers to  bepromoted  wouldeither have retired or would not beavailable.   Inthat   backdrop.  he had advised the contemners to  go by  the existing  reports and to consider them  in  accordance  with  the Rulesfor  the  promotion; therefore, theyhave not disregarded the directions  ofthis court. It is   seen  from  the  judgment that  specific and unequivocal directions have  been given  as to  how and by whom C.Rs.  areto  be written.  They relate to  two items. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 One isthat the  respondents should  identify such  of the officers whom  opportunity to line assignment of rural/semi- urban serviceswas given but they did not avail of thesame and toeliminate suchof the officerswho have nor availed of the opportunity but could not  contemplate assignment but for no fault oftheirs and those who have completed theline assignment should  be includedin Group  A and their cases shouldbe  further  considered for  further  promotion  in accordance with the Rules.  Inthe  affidavit filed  by Mr. S.S.

In  substance,   their contention is that  it is not practicable to write the ACRS at this distance of time.They have also  further stated that they have obtained the advice of thecounseland  onthe  faith of  that, question,Shri Shanti Bhushanhas taken responsibility on himself  for the advice and  stated that he understoodthe judgment ofthis court in  a manner which is notinconsistent with its letter spirit.

We fail to understand the reason for not proceeding with the suit on account of the pendency of this appeal which concerns an order on application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and has no relevance as far as the decision of the suit on merits is concerned. While dismissing the application seeking early hearing, we direct the trial court to proceed with the suit and decide it expeditiously."" : 2 : Today, it has been brought to our notice that despite the aforesaid order passed by this Court directing the trial court to proceed with the pending suit and decide it expeditiously, an order has been passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in Civil Revision Application No.94 of 2007 which stayed the trial of the suit.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated August  9,1996, made  by the  Division  Bench  of  the Orissa High Court in OJC No. 3073/95. The admitted  position is that at one point of time the appellant had a permanent stage carriage permit operating on the inter-State route, viz., Peralakhemundi to Berhampur via chatrapur and Garabandha. After the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 came into  force, the  appellant filed  an  application  for renewal of  the permit  and the  dispute arose whether he is entitled to  renewal of  the permit.  Since, admittedly, the permit granted  under Act  4 of  1939 expired after the 1988 Act came  into force,  he was to apply afresh under the 1988 Act .  Earlier when  he had  filed a  Writ Petition, OJC No. 3421/93, the  High Court had directed reconsideration of the application for respondents, after decision was taken on the application of the petitioner therein. Admittedly, the State Transport Authority  had considered  their applications  and rejected the  application for respondent. On a clarification sought by  the contesting  respondent, the  High  Court  had pointed out  that the  judgment was not intended to have the permit  granted  to  the  contesting  respondent  cancelled; nonetheless  the  application  of  the  appellant  would  be considered as and when need arose. Shri A.K.  Panda, learned  counsel  for  the  appellant contends that  in view  of the  decision of  this  Court  in Gajraj Singh  & Ors.  v. State  Transport Appellate Tribunal [(1997)  1   SCC  650],  in  particular  paragraph  62,  the appellant is  entitled to  apply afresh and to be considered by the  authorities in  accordance with  law. He  has stated that he  had filed  an application  for renewal on 4.11.1996 for grant  of  permanent  licence.  In  view  of  the  above decision of  this Court, if any permit was renewed under the provisions to be a temporary permit under Section 87 of that Act and that before expiry thereof, parties were directed to make an  application afresh  under the  1988  Act  and  seek permit thereunder  in accordance  with  law.  The  direction issued by  the High Court is not inconsistent with the above judgment of  this Court.  Under those  circumstances, if the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellant has any right for grant of permit, the same has to be in accordance with law. Necessary application which comes to be  made in  accordance with law should be disposed of by the S.T.A. as per the provisions of the 1988 Act. The appeal  is accordingly  dismissed  with  the  above observations. No costs.","The appellant had a permanent stage carriage permit operating on the inter-State route, viz., Peralakhemundi to Berhampur via chatrapur and Garabandha.

" O R D E R This is  an astonishing  and more  shocking  case.  The petitioner who  was, admittedly,  to retire  on May 31, 1991 remained in  office till  May 31,  1994 as  if he was not to retire from service, enjoying all the benefit of service. This special  leave petition  arises from  the order of the Central  Administrative Tribunal,  Patna Bench,  made on November 26,  1996 in  OA No.  652/95.  The  petitioner  has joined  the   service  in  Tele  Communications  Department. Admittedly, his  date of birth is May 13, 1933. On attaining the age of superannuation, he was to retire on May 31, 1991. Instead, he  remained in  service till  May 31,  1994.  When action was  taken to recover the amounts paid to him for the period beyond  the date  he was to retire viz., May 31, 1991 and to  which he  was not  entitled,  he  filed  OA  in  the Tribunal and the same has been dismissed. Thus, this special leave petition. The learned  counsel for  the petitioner  contends that since the  petitioner has  worked during  the period,  he is entitled to  the payment  of the  pay  and  allowances  from 1.6.1991 to  26.6.1994 and  that the is also entitled to the payment   of   Provisional   Pension,   Death-cum-retirement gratuity, leave  encashment commutation  of pension  amount, GPF money and the amount deposit under CGHS on the plea that he retired  from service  on May  31, 1994. We are aghast to notice the  boldness  with  which  it  is  claimed  that  he entitled to  all the benefits with effect from the abovesaid date when  admittedly he  was to  retire on May 31, 1991. It would be an obvious case of absolute irresponsibility on the part of  the officer  concerned in  the Establishment in the concerned section  for not  taking any  action to  have  the petitioner   retired   from   service   on   his   attaining superannuation. It is true that the petitioner worked during that period, but when he is not to continue to be in service as per  law, he  has no right to claim the salary etc. It is not the  case  that    he  was  re-employed  in  the  public interest,  after   attaining  superannuation.   Under  these circumstances, we  do not  find any illegality in the action taken by the authorities in refusing to grant the benefits. It is  then contended  that the  petitioner would  have http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 conveniently secured gainful employment elsewhere and having worked, he  cannot be  denied of  the legitimate  salary  to which he  is entitled  to . Though the argument is alluring, we cannot  accept the  contention and give legitimacy to the illegal action  taken by  the authorities. If the contention is given  acceptance, it would be field day for manipulation with impugnity  and one would get away on the plea of equity and misplaced  sympathy. It  cannot and  should not be given countenance. Under those circumstances, we dismiss the petition with a direction  to the  Government of India to take appropriate disciplinary action  against all  the persons  concerned for their deliberate  dereliction of  duty in  not ensuring  the petitioner’s  retirement   on  his   attaining  the  age  of superannuation. The Ragistry  is directed  to communicate this order to the Secretary , Telecommunications, Government of India. The Secretary is  directed to  ensure immediate  action  in  the matter and  submit the compliance report to the Registrar of this Court  within three months from the date of the receipt of this order.","Petitioner who was to retire on May 31, 1991 remained in office till May 31,. 1994 as if he was not to retire from service.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment dated 16th  August, 1991 of the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court  made in  F.A. No.135/91. The High Court accepted the oral  evidence that  the yield from the land was 22 bags per acre. It also accepted the deduction of 50% of the value of the  crop for  cultivation expenses. It also accepted the prevailing price  as on  the relevant  dated as Rs.130/- per bag; 27.20  acres for  single crop wet lands and 4 acres for double crop  wet lands.  Therefore, it accepted the findings of the  reference Court  and modified the same to the extent of single crop wet lands. Thus this appeal by special leave. Notification  under   Section  4   [1]  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894 [for  short, ""the Act""] was published on 19th August, 1983. The award under Section 11 was made on April 25,  1987. The reference Court awarded compensation on 8th February,  1991. On appeal, by judgment and decree dated 16th August,  1991, the  High Court confirmed the award with the above modification. It is  contended for  the State that statistics for the year 1957 show that the yield in that area was about 10 bags and that,  therefore,  the  High  Court  was  not  right  in confirming the  compensation at 22 bags per acre. It is seen that from  the year  1957 till 1987 considerable improvement must obviously have been made. Under those circumstances, no attempt has  been made  by the State to produce the relevant statistics  of   the  produce   as  on   the  date   of  the notification, viz.,  19th August, 1983. Therefore, we cannot accept the contention of the State that the produce from the lands would  be as  per the  statistics prevailing  in 1957. Even accepting the valuation given by the reference Court as well as the High Court, it is settled law that multiplier of 10  would   be  the   proper  multiplier  to  determine  the compensation when  the land  is assessed on the basis of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 yield of  agricultural lands.  The reference  Court  applied multiplier  of  16  and  the  High  Court  upheld  it.  This obviously is  illegal and  application of wrong principle of law. The annual  yield at  Rs.1430/- should be multiplied by 10 and  the market value should be determined at Rs.14,300/- per acre. The compensation should accordingly be determined. The claimants  would also  be entitled  to enhanced solatium and interest  and also  12% additional  amount per  annum on enhanced compensation  under the Act as amended by Act 68 of 1984. The appeal is allowed accordingly. No costs.","This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment dated 16th August, 1991 of the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court.

" O R D E R The only  question is whether the respondents can claim right as  tenants to  the possession  of the  demised  lands under the  Bombay Tenancy  and Agricultural  Lands Act  1943 (for short  ’the Act’)? The admitted facts are that the land originally  belonged   to   one   Lilachand   Bhandari.   He hypothecated the  lands on  July 27,  1942 in  favour of one Hirachand, the father of respondent Nos. 1 and 4 (defendants 1 &  4) under  the possessory mortgage. In 1947-48 Hirachand leased those lands to respondent Nos.2 and 3 (defendants 2 & 3). While  remaining to  be  tenants,  respondent  No.2  had purchased the  equity of  redemption of the suit lands for a sum  of   Rs.12,000/-  on  December  27,  1949.  The  second respondent in  turn sold  half of the undivided  interest in the land to one Housabai, mother of the appellant on January 19, 1950.  From these  facts the question arose: whether the second and  the third  respondents remained to be tenants in the land  after the Act had come into force? When the matter was referred  to  Mamlatdar  for  decision,  a  finding  was recorded by him and also by the appellate authority that the property  having   been  purchased   by  way  of  equity  of redemption, the  lesser right  of tenancy stood  merged with their larger  right  as  owners  and  that,  therefore,  the respondents  no   longer  remained   to  be   the   tenants; consequently, the  appellant alone  was held to be the owner of undivided  share in the land and the respondent could not claim tenancy  rights under the Act. But, unfortunately, the High Court  in Second   Appeal reversed the said finding and held in the impugned order  that the respondents remained to be tenants  and that,therefore,  the Act got attracted.  The appellant  thereby  had  to  surrender  his  rights  to  the tenants. Thus this appeal by special leave. It would be seen that though the respondent Nos.2 and 3 had come  into possession  as tenants  in the   year 1947-48 from the  mortgagee Hirachand, after the second respondent’s purchase of  the equity  of redemption on December 27, 1949, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 they became  absolute owner  of the  suit property. Thereby, their  lesser  tenancy  rights  which  they  had  under  the mortgagee Hirachand,stood  merged with their larger interest as owner   of  the lands.  Thereby on  and from December 27, 1949  they  ceased  to  be  the  tenants.  Having  sold  the undivided half  land to  the mother of the appellant who has since died  and the  appellant having  succeeded the land by intestate succession  by registered conveyance dated January 19, 1950  they became  co-owners in  the property.  Thereby, they are  entitled to partition of the same after redemption of the  mortgage in  equal moiety and enjoyment thereof. The suit of  the appellant,  therefore, is clearly maintainable. It is accordingly to be decreed. We are informed that pursuant to the preliminary decree granted by  the trial  Court, the  appellant had deposited a sum of Rs.4,000/- as directed in the preliminary decree. But it would  appear that  the respondents  have  not  deposited their share. Three month’s time from today is granted to the respondents to  deposit the  same. On deposit being so made, the trial  Court would  draw up the final decree within four weeks thereafter  and pass  appropriate orders  according to law and  deliver possession  of the  land that  fell to  the share of the appellant, within six weeks thereafter. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","The land originally belonged to  one Lilachand   Bhandari.

" O R D E R Substitution allowed. Leave granted. Notification  under   section  7   of   Requisition   & Acquisition of  Immovable Properties  Act, 1852  (for short, the ""Act"")  was published  on October 13, 1969 and the award was  made.  Pursuant  thereto  an  offer  was  made  to  the respondents in  Form ’F’  of the Rules framed under the Act. The respondents  had not  agreed for  the compensation. As a consequence, the  matter was  referred under section 8(1) to the arbitrator.  He took  up the  matter on November 7, 1975 and the  award was  made on  August 19, 1983. The arbitrator awarded higher compensation with solatium and interest. When the matter  was carried to the High Court by the appellants, the  High  Court  had  further  enhanced  the  solatium  and interest  applying   the  amended  provisions  of  the  Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 68 of 1984 by judgment and order dated 10.2.1984. Thus this appeal by special leave. This Court  in Union  of India  v. Hari  Krishan Khosla [(1993) Supp.  2 SCC  149] has  held that  for the  property acquired under  the  Act,  the  principle  of  solatium  and interest under  Land  Acquisition  Act  1  of  1894  is  not applicable and  that, therefore,  the land  owners  are  not entitled to  the payment  thereof. Noticing  a  judgment  of another three-Judge  Bench which had granted interest due to an abnormal  delay on  the part  of the  Union of  India  in appointing the  arbitrator interest  was  awarded.  All  the cases thereafter were considered in Union of India & Anr. v. Munsha & Ors. [JT (1995) 8 SC 289]. This Court has held that where the  State is not in any way responsible for the delay in appointing the arbitrator, the claimants are not entitled to the payment of interest. Where the State, after the owner objected to  the award  of the  Collector, is responsible in delaying the  appointment of  an arbitrator, necessarily the State has  to bear  the burden  of paying  interest  to  the claimants. Each case has to be examined on its own facts. In http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 this case  since the  respondents had informed the appellant that they  were not  agreeable to the award of the Collector and made  an offer  in Form  ’F’ and  immediately thereafter reference was  made to  the arbitrator,  the  State  is  not responsible for  delay in the award of the arbitrator. Under those  circumstances,   the  State  is  not  liable  to  pay interest. This Court has also repeatedly held that when the Court does  not   award  any  enhanced  compensation  which  is  a condition precedent for the application of the provisions of Interest and  solatium under  the Land  Acquisition Act, the Court lacks  inherent jurisdiction  to  award  solatium  and interest in  the land  acquisition cases. Equally so, of the enhanced solatium and interest under the Amendment Act 68 of 1984. In  these cases, since the Land Acquisition Act itself does not apply to the acquisition of the land under the Act, the   Amendment Act  68 of  1984 equally does not apply. The High Court,  therefore, has  committed grave error of law in applying the  provisions of  the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 to further enhance solatium and interest. The appeals  are  accordingly  allowed.  The  order  of arbitrator as  confirmed by the High Court awarding solatium and interest  stands  set  aside.  In  other  respects,  the determination of compensation stands upheld.

" O R D E R Leave Granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The respondents had filed writ petition claiming higher scale of  pay on  their acquiring  B.T./E.Ed. qualification. Admittedly, they  were appointed  as Junior  Basic Teachers. They improved their qualifications and claimed parity on the basis of  the letter issued by the then Punjab Government on July 23,1957  in Circular  No.5056-FR-11/57. The  High Court issued the directions. Thus, this appeal by special leave. The controversy  is covered  by the  Judgment  of  this Court in Wazir Singh vs. State of Haryana [1995 Supp.(3) SCC 697] wherein this Court held while dealing with the revision of the  pay-scale of  Government employees,  i.e.,  teaching personnel of  the Education  Department, the  Government  of Haryana had in their policy instructions dated March 9, 1990 expressed in unequivocal terms that the intention to retract from the  earlier principle that teachers acquiring the B.T. or B.Ed.  degree would  be entitled to the higher grade with effect from  the respective  dates of  their acquiring  that qualification.  therefore,  as  they  did  not  acquire  the qualification before  9.3.1990, they are not entitled to the benefit of the higher grade of pay automatically. It is  contended by  Shri Pankaj Kalra, learned counsel for the respondents, that this controversy was considered by this Court  in Chaman lal vs. State of Haryana [(1987) 3 SCC 213] and  the Government  cannot by  the memo dated March 9, 1990 set  at naught  the judgment  of this Court. We find no force in the contention. It is seen that the Government have specifically explained  in  their  letter  that  though  the composite Punjab  State had  issued the above circular which was accepted  by the  Kothari Commission,  the Government of Haryana after  its letter  dated January  5,  1968  had  not followed that  Punjab Order.  However, it was construed that the Government have adopted the above letter. In that light, they  had  reconsidered  the  entire  issue  and  stated  in paragraph 6 of the letter thus: ""6.  In   order   to   remove   the confusion    being    created    by misconstruing the  intention of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Govt., the  whole matter  has  been reconsidered by  the  whole  matter has been  reconsidered by the State Govt.

This letter  was considered  by  this  Court  in  Wazir Singh’s case  and it  was held  that those  who acquired the qualifications are not automatically entitled to the fitment in the  higher pay  scales. In the judgment in Wazir Singh’s case itself  it was  mentioned in  para 10  that the counsel appearing for  the State had conceded that all those who had acquired B.T.  and/or B.Ed.  before March  9, 1990  would be entitled to  get higher  scales of pay in terms of para 2 of the Punjab  State’s letter  dated July  23, 1957. Therefore, the circular  of the Government dated March 9, 1990 would be prospective in candidates who acquired the qualifications on and after  the said date and they are not entitled to higher scale of pay.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Bombay Bench dated 7.3.1995 made in  OA No.  755/90. It  is not necessary to narrate all the facts in this case. Suffice it to state that by order of this Court  dated August  12, 1996,  this Court directed the appellants to  produce their  orders of  promotion from Data Processing Assistants  to Data  Processing  Supervisors  and also their scales of pay. Pursuant thereto, the records have been produced  which  establish  that  the  appellants  were promoted from  Data Processing Assistants to Data Processing Supervisors.

" (with civil Appears No.22/98 arising out of SLP (C) 17234 of 1997 J U D G M E N T Kirpal, J. SLP (c) 13908 of 1997 Special leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The short  question which  arises for  consideration is whether the high Court was right in coming to the conclusion that a plot of land which had been allotted to the appellant could not have been converted to a residential plot on which construction could be made inasmuch as it was meant to be an open space. The proceeding  before the High Court were initiated on a writ  petition being  filed by  the respondent as a public Interest  Litigation,   inter  alia,   contending  that  the respondent had purchased a plot of land on the understanding that the  plot in  question in the present appeal was really an  open   space  adjoining  a  kinder  garten  school.  The respondent found in 1995 that the appellant was constructing a house  and thereupon a writ petition was filed in the High Court which  issued notice and on 8th of March, 1995 granted stay of  further construction.  The  High  Court  ultimately allowed the writ petition and came to the conclusion that in as much  as the  plot in  question was  earmarked as an open area adjoining  a school  it could  not have  been converted into a  residential plot  without following  an  appropriate procedure. On behalf  of the  appellant, our  attention  has  been drawn to  a Notification  No. 16(6)  - 87  - XXXII - I dated 15th February,  19941 issued  under Section  19(1) of Madhya Pradesh Nagar  Tatha Gram  Nivesh  Adhinayam,  1973  whereby Development plan of the area in question was approved. It is not  in  dispute  that  as  per  this  Notification  in  the Development Plan  the plot  in question,  purchased  by  the appellant, was  shown as a residential plot. Of course, this area had  earlier been  earmarked as  an open  space but  by virtue  of  the  Development  Plan,  now  approved  on  15th February, 1991, the change of user had occurred. The respondent  in the writ petition, filed in the High http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court,  had   not  challenged   this  Notification  of  15th February, 1991.  The High Court, in turn, also did not quash this  Notification.   There  being   no  challenge  to  this Notification, the  Development Plan  which was  so  approved become  final.   The  land   use  which  was  shown  in  the Development plan  not having  been challenged,  we  fail  to appreciate as  to how the High Court could have ignored this fact and  come to  a contrary  conclusion. The appellant had purchased  this   plot  of  land  in  April,  1991  and  had admittedly started  construction in  January, 1995. The writ petition was  filed nearly  four years after the approval of the Development  plan vide Notification dated 15th February, 1991 and apart from the questions of laches, even on merits, there was  no reason  for the  High Court to have interfered when  the  residential  plot  shown  in  the  duly  approved Development plan  had been allotted as a residential plot to the appellant  and was  used for  constructing a residential unit therein.  Merely because  at an  earlier point  of time when the  respondent had constructed his house this plot had been shown  as an  open space  cannot give  a right  to  the respondent to ask the High Court to prevent the construction on that area when the respondent has chosen not to challenge the change in the land use from open space to residential as per the approved plan. On this ground alone, in our opinion, the writ  petition filed  by the respondent should have been dismissed. For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal is allowed. The judgement  of the  High Court  is set aside and the writ petition filed  by the  respondent is dismissed. There will, however, be no order as to costs. SLP (C) 17234 of 1997 Leave granted. For the  reasons stated in our judgment in civil appeal arising out  of SLP(C)  13908 of  1997, this  appeal is also allowed.

" O R D E R These SLPs arise from the order dated 13.10.1995 of the Division Bench  of the  Bombay High  Court in  L.P.A.  Stamp No.26774/95 and the order dated 13.9.95 in Appeal from Order No.826/94. The petitioner claims to have entered into an agreement on June  21, 1973  to purchase certain lands from A.H. Wadia Charity Trust.  In 1975,  when one  Mohd.  Amin  and  others attempted to  construct a boundary wall in the said land, he claimed to  have filed  Suit No.298  of 1975  in  the  Civil Court, Bombay and had an injunction against them restraining from interfering with his possession and construction of the boundary wall.  When the  petitioner had attempted to repair the existing  road  on  the  land  and  open  drainage,  the respondent filed  Suit No.493/90  in the  City Civil  Court, Bombay for  injunction. The  respondent  claimed  to  be  in possession of  the land  admeasuring 1947  sq. mts.  On  its basis, the  petitioner claimed  that they were attempting to trespass into  his land.  Consequently, the  appellant filed Suit No.3670/94  on June 16, 1994 and also sought ad interim injunction  to   restrain  the  respondent  from  committing trespassing into his land. Initially, interim injunction was granted on  June 28, 1994. When the appeal was filed against that order,  the learned  single Judge  of  the  High  Court directed  the   Commissioner  to   demarcate  the  lands  in exclusive possession  and enjoyment of the petitioner within the compound wall by order dated September 13, 1995. Against that order,  the  petitioner  filed  Letters  Patent  Appeal contending that  the  order  of  the  learned  single  Judge amounts to  granting temporary mandatory injunction to break the compound  wall and removing article etc. By the impugned order dated  13, 1995,  the Division Bench rejected the same on the  ground that  LPA would  not lie against the order of the learned single Judge. Thus these SLPs. It is  contended for the petitioner that as per the law http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 laid down  by this  Court in Shah Babulal Khimji vs. Jayaben (AIR 1981  SC 1787),  L.P.A. would lie to the Division Bench against the  interlocutory order  of the  single Judge  and, therefore, the view of the High Court is not correct in law. We find no force in the contention. Order 43,  Rule 1,  CPC provides  an  appeal  from  the orders passed  under Order 39 Rule 1 etc., as stated in sub- rule (r), which provides as under: ""(r) an order under Rule 1, Rule 2, Rule 2A, Rule 4 or Rule 10 of Order XXXIX."" Section 104  CPC provides for an appeal from the orders provided in Order 43 save as otherwise expressly provided in the body  of this  Code or  by any law for the time being in force and  from no  other orders.  Sub-section (2) envisages that ""no  appeal shall  lie from  any order passed in appeal under this Section"". It would,  therefore, be  clear that when an appeal was filed against  the order  of the City Civil Court, Bombay to the learned  single Judge  under  Order  43,  Rule  1(r)  as provided in  sub-section (1)  of Section 104 by operation of sub-section (2)  of Section 104, no further appeal shall lie from any  order passed  in appeal  under  this  Section.  In Khimji’s case  (supra) the  suit was  filed on  the original side of  the High  Court and the learned single Judge on the original side  passed an  interlocutory order.  Against  the orders of  the  learned  single  Judge,  though  it  was  an interlocutory order,  since the  appeal  would  lie  to  the Division Bench  under the  Letters Patent,  this Court  held that against  the interlocutory  orders passed by the single Judge, Letters  Patent Appeal  would be  maintainable.  That ratio, therefore,  is clearly  inapplicable to  the facts in this case. The SLPs are accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner claims to have entered into an agreement on June 21, 1973 to purchase certain lands from A.H. Wadia Charity Trust. In 1975, when one Mohd.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  has been  filed against  the order  of the High Court  of Bombay,made on January 20,  1997  inWrit Petition 6182 of 1996.

That order of eviction became final with theconfirmation ofthe order by this  Court   in  a   special  leave  petition. Thereafter, proceedings were  initiated for execution. An objection has been raised on the ground that since more than 12 yearshave elapsed, the order cannot be implemented. The High Court has pointedout  that under Section 21 of the Mamlatdar’s Court Act,  1906,   it  has  not  prescribedany  limitation for execution of  the orders vide the Division Bench judgment of the High  Courtof  Bombay in  Babaji Khandujivs.  Kushaba Ramji [8 BombayLaw Reporter (1906) 218].

He places reliance on  the decisions  in State  of Gujarat  vs.  Patel Raghav Natha  &Ors.

Section 21 of the Mamalatdar’s Court Actdoes not prescribe any limitation within which the order needs to be executed.

The   Collector  made  an  award  for  a  sum  of Rs.38,500/-. Since  the petitioner  laid claim  for a higher amount, a  reference under  s.18 was  made. The  civil court disbelieved  the   agreement  of   sale  put  forth  by  the petitioner; therefore,  reference was  ordered in  favour of the respondents.  In appeal,  the High  Court said  that the said agreement  was in  violation of  s.4 of  the Delhi Land (Restriction &  Transfer) Act, 1972 and that, therefore, the agreement  is   void.  Accordingly,   the  findings  of  the Reference Court  was accepted.  Thus, this appeal by Special Leave. Learned counsel  appearing for the petitioner contended that the  under the  agreement of  sale dated  5th December, 1981 the respondents had received consideration and kept the petitioner in possession of the land and that, therefore, by operation of  s,53-A of  the Transfer  of Property  Act, the petitioner is entitled to the compensation. We are unable to agree with  the learned counsel. In a reference, the dispute is to  the title  to receive the compensation. It is settled http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 law that the agreement of sale does not confer    title and, therefore, the  agreement holder,  even  assuming  that  the agreement is  valid, does  not  acquire  any  title  to  the property. It is seen that the agreement is subsequent to the notification under  s.4(1). The  Government is  not bound by such an agreement. The inter-se dispute is only with respect to the  title as  on the  date of notification under s.4(1). The respondent is the undoubted owner of the property as per s.4 notification  and that,  therefore, the compensation was directed to be paid to the respondent since he is one of the members. We  cannot find  any illegality in the order passed by the  Courts. However, if the petitioner has got any claim under s.30 of the Land Acquisition Act, it is open to him to take such action as open to him under law. The Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.","The High Court said that the said agreement was in violation of s.4 of the Delhi Land (Restriction & Transfer) Act, 1972 and that, therefore, the agreement is   void.

(Under article 32 of the Constitution of India) http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Govind  Mukhoty   and  Ms.   Kamini  Jaiswal   for  the petitioners. 777 L.N, Sinha,  K.G. Bhagat,  Addl. Sol.  General,  R.  N. Poddar, P.P. Singh and D. Goburdhan for Respondents. The Order of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI,  J. We have heard counsel for the parties at length and  have also gone through the Reports and documents filed by  the petitioners.  In view  of the  fact  that  the counsel for  the respondents  are more or less agreed to the order we  propose to  pass, it  is not  necessary to go into further details. The facts  as gleaned  from the  Reports and  documents reveal a  most shocking  state of  affairs in  the region in question. It  seems that  a very large number of people have been languishing  in jails without trial for petty offences. Though most  of the  said people  are alleged  to have  been released but  the main infirmity has not been cured. Without going into  further details,  we dispose of the petitions in terms of the following Order: ""(1) In  all   cases  instituted  against  the  adivasi accused concerned  which  involve  sentence  of  7 years  or  more,  they  will  be  entitled  to  be released on  consideration of  merit by  the court concerned only on executing a personal bond. These cases will be disposed of on merits expeditiously. (2)  In the other cases where trial has already started and which  do not  come within the first category, indicated above,  the accused  will be entitled to be released  on bail  on executing a personal bond in the absence of very special circumstances. (3)  In the  cases where  no proceedings  at  all  have taken place  in regard  to the  accused  within  3 years from  the date  of the  lodging of  FIR, the accused should be released forthwith under section 169 Cr.P.C. (4)  If there  are other cases in which neither charge- sheet have  been submitted  nor investigation  has been completed  during the  last three  years, the accused 778 concerned should  be released forthwith subject to reinvestigation of  the said  case on  fresh facts and  they   shall  not  be  arrested  without  the permission of  the Magistrate and where permission is given  they would be released by the Magistrate on execution of personal bond. We would  like to  observe that  Section 144 Cr. P.C. should not be  misused and  orders under  this  Section  should  be passed in  the light of principles laid down in 1983 (4) SCC 161 at page 169. At the same time, we would like to warn Adivasi accused that they  should not  take the  law in  their own  hands by shooting or  using their  arrows on  Government Officers  or other forest  officers. If  they have any complaint they can move the  appropriate authority and get suitable orders from him. H.S.K. 779","The petition was filed by Govind Mukhoty and Ms. Kamini Jaiswal.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL No. 1477     OF 2007 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 3943 of 2007) Heard. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length.  From the impugned order we find that the writ petition was not entertained primarily on the ground that the same will be an exercise in futility because of purported delay in approaching the High Court.  Learned counsel for the appellant has highlighted as to how there was actually no delay in approaching the High Court and various steps which were being taken by the appellants to press their grievances.  It is pointed out that though the High Court declined to entertain the writ petition on the ground  of delay, as of today the tendered shops have not \026    2 - yet become functional.  Learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 5 submits that though the shops may not have become functional, huge investments have been made.   This is also the stand of Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL),  Respondent No. 3. One of the points highlighted by Mr. F.S.Nariman, learned senior counsel for the appellants is that till now no order either accepting or rejecting the Expression of Interest has been indicated.  Learned counsel for  MIAL stated that the fact that no bid document was issued to the appellants is indicative of the fact that Expression of Interest was not accepted.  Several other grounds have been highlighted to show the ineligibility of the appellants to even bid in the matter and/or submit of the Expression of Interest, as well as the writ petition.  We find that all these aspects have not been dealt with by the High Court which refused to entertain the writ petition as indicated above primarily on the ground of delay. Taking into account all the relevant factors we feel that it will be in the interest of the parties if the writ \026    3 - petition is heard on merits.  It is open to the parties to highlight their respective stand on merits as well as the maintainability.  We express no opinion in that regard. Let the parties appear before the Chief Justice of the High Court with a copy of our order on Monday i.e. 25.02.2008.  We request the Chief Justice of the High Court to fix a date and mark the case to a designated Bench which is requested to dispose of the writ petition by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 24th March, 2008.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated 31.7.1979 of the High Court of Allahabad made in Civil Revision No.84 of 1978. The  admitted  position  is  that  one  Mohd.  Marghoob Siddiqui had  migrated to  Pakistan prior to August 14, 1947 and became  a citizen  of Pakistan. His mother Kabool Fatima who remained  in India  die on August 7, 1965. Subsequently, he came  to India and appears to have obtained the Bhumidari right of his mother and sold the property to the appellants. The  respondents   has  initiated  proceedings  against  the property on  the ground  that Mohd. Marghoob Siddiqui was an enemy and therefore, the Enemy Property Act, 1968 (Act No.34 of 1968) was applicable. The appellants claimed title to the property. Subsequently  thereto, the appellants filed a suit for injunction  to  restrain  the  respondents  from  taking possession of  the property.  Ultimately  they  came  to  be successful in the revision before the High Court. Thus, this appeal by special leave.

On   his   acquiring citizenship of  Pakistan,  M.M.  Siddiqui  ceased  to  be  a citizen of India and thereby after the demise of his mother, he had  no right,  title or  interest in  the land to obtain bhumidari right. The proceedings and patta are void. Under these  circumstances, since  the purchaser cannot have a  better  title  than  the  seller  himself  has,  the appellants could  not acquire  any title  by virtue  of sale effected by Mohd.

" JUDGMENT O  R  D  E  R Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and the respondents. This appeal is directed against the judgment  passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.1505/1996 allowing the Writ Petition filed by the respondent herein.  The High Court by the impugned order modified the punishment by way of stoppage of two increments with cumulative effect and quashed the order of dismissal from service awarded to the respondent herein.  The High Court also ordered reinstatement with all pecuniary and consequential service benefits. We have been taken through the charges framed against the respondent herein and also the Enquiry Report submitted by the Enquiry Officer and the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority and also the order passed in the Claim Petition. Five charges were framed against the respondent herein. The charges are very serious in nature.  The charges No.1,2,3 and 5 have been proved beyond any doubt. Charge No.4 has not been proved. On a consideration of the entire materials placed before the authorities, they came to the conclusion that the order of dismissal would meet the ends of justice.    When a Writ Petition was filed challenging the correctness of the order of dismissal, the High Court interfered with the order of dismissal on the ground that the acts complained of were sheer mistakes or errors on the part of the respondent herein and for that no punishment could be attributed to the respondent.  In our opinion, the order passed by the High Court quashing the order of dismissal is nothing but the error of judgment.  In our opinion, the High Court was not justified in allowing the Writ Petition and quashing the order of dismissal and granting continuity of service with all pecuniary and consequential service benefits.  It is a settled law that the High Court has limited scope of interference in the administrative action of the State in exercise of extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer and the consequent order of punishment of dismissal from service should not be disturbed.  As already noticed, the charges are very serious in nature and the same have been proved beyond any doubt.  We have also carefully gone through the Enquiry Report and the order of the Disciplinary Authority and of the Tribunal and we are unable to agree with the reasons given by the High Court in modifying the punishment imposed by the Disciplinary Authority. In short, the judgment of the High Court is nothing but perverse. We, therefore, have no other option except to set aside the order passed by the High Court and restore the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority ordering dismissal of the respondent herein from service.  It is ordered accordingly.  The Civil Appeal stands allowed. No costs.",This appeal is directed against the judgment  passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Misc.

" J U D G M E N T Nanvati. J. The State  has filed  this appeal against the acquittal of the  respondent who  was convicted by the trial court but acquitted  by   the  High   Court.  This   is  a   case   if circumstantial evidence. The circumstances which were relied upon by  the prosecution were relied upon by the prosecution were as under: ""1. Motive; 2.  The accused  and the  deceased last seen  in the  company  of each other; 3.   Finding   of   blood-stained clothes and  footwear  in  the house  of  the  accused  under panchnama; 4.  Finding of  human blood on the pyjama seized from the persons of the  accused at the time of arrest of the accused; 5.  Recovery of  the stone  at the instance of  the  accused  and the same  being  blood-stained with  human   blood  of   ˜’A’ Group; and 6.  False explanation  alleged  to have been given by the accused to the inmates of the house of the  deceased-Dnyany  on  14th April 1982."" The trial court did not rely upon circumstances Nos.  2 and 3 but relying upon other circumstances, it convicted the respondent. The High  Court did  not place  any reliance  upon  the recovery of  blood stained  shirts from  the  house  of  the accused as  in the panchnama under which they were seized it was not at all stated that there were blood on those shirts. On the  ’chapals’, which  were recovered  from the house, no human    blood  was detected.  Therefore,  no  reliance  was placed by the High Court on that circumstance also. The High http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 court doubted  recovery of the stone with which the deceased was alleged to have been killed on the ground that the whole story was  improbable particularly  when it was found from a distance of  1&1/2 furlongs.   Moreover, the prosecution had failed to establish where the incident had taken place. We have  gone through the evidence and we find that the view taken  by the  High Court  is not  unreasonable.

This appeal, by special leave, arises from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court, passed on May 2, 1996 in L.P.A. No.815/95. The admitted  facts are  that while the respondents was working  temporarily  as  Superintending  Engineer,  several proceedings were  initiated against him statedly for his own misconduct in  the matter  of financial transactions etc. It is not necessary to dilate upon all facts in detail. Suffice it to state that the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC), duly constituted  by  the  Government,  had  gone  into  the question whether  the respondent  was fit for promotion from the post of Executive Engineer as Superintending Engineer on regular basis  in the  proceedings dated  13.9.1995, the DPC found as under: ""Hence the  Departmental  Promotion Committee examined  in its  meeting all the  relevant  papers/documents made available  by the  Department. After  examination   the  Committee found the  Officer  proposed  unfit for promotion upto 16.1.1994."" In view  of the  above finding of fact by the competent Committee, the question arises: whether the High Court could record finding  that the  respondent could be deemed to have been promoted  from January  17, 1989 with all consequential benefits. The  view taken  by the  High  Court  is  palpably illegal for  the reason that once the DPC had found that the respondent was  unfit for promotion upto that date, the only course that requires to be  adopted by the High Court was to remit the  matter to  the Government for constitution of the DPC to  consider his  fitment for promotion in later period. In that  event, the  DPC would go into the merits afresh and find out  whether the respondent would be fit for promotion. If he  would be found fit and recommendation is made in that behalf, the  Government would  appoint him  on regular basis and he  would get  seniority  only  from  the  date  of  his promotion; and not from the earlier date when he was working http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 on ad  hoc basis. we are not inclined to express any opinion on merits  either way.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We Have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the High  Court of  Delhi made  on  July  25,  1995  in  CMP No.534/92 wherein it was held that the appeal had abated and consequently the same was dismissed. It is not necessary to dilate upon the facts on merits. Suffice it  to state  that pending  first appeal in the High Court,  the   sole  appellant  died  on  December  1,  1990. Intimation of  death  was  given  by  the  counsel  for  the respondents on August 5, 1991, but the application could not be filed due to the delay on the part of the counsel for the deceased-appellant as  sworn in  by him  in  his  affidavit. Consequently, the  appeal having  abated  was  dismissed  on November 18,  1991. Then  an application came to be filed on May  4,   1992  seeking  setting  aside  of  the  abatement, condonation of  the delay  in filing  the application and to bring the  legal representatives  of the  sole appellant  on record. That application came to be dismissed for failure to give proper explanation. Thus, this appeal by special leave.

Consequently, the  application came  to be filed on May 4, 1992.  In view  of the  statement of  the counsel for the deceased-sole appellant   that  the delay had occurred since he could not communicate to the legal representatives of the information issued  by the respondents of the death and that the legal  representatives obviously  were not  aware of the appeal in  filed by their father; that resulted in abatement for not bringing the legal representatives on record.

" ORDER 1.   The submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that  the  change  made  in the  law  has  no  retrospective application in order to permit the authority to rely on  the larger  period of limitation prescribed under the  new  law. On this basis he submits that in the present case the notice of  reassessment given to the petitioner is invalid  because it  is  based  on the application of the  larger  period  of limitation prescribed under the new law.  The High Court has dismissed the petitioner’s writ petition on the ground  that the points raised by the petitioner are available to him for being   raised  by  the  petitioner  before  the   assessing authority. 2.   The  above  submission  of  learned  counsel  for   the petitioner  is  based  on  certain facts  which  are  to  be determined in the first instance by the assessing authority. The  petitioner  can  place his case  before  the  assessing authority in response to the notice issued to the petitioner and  await the decision of the assessing authority  on  that point.  It appears that even under the old law, in a certain situation  the objection of limitation may not arise if  the facts  necessary to attract that provision providing  for  a larger  limitation are found in the present case.   In  case the  assessing authority has already completed the  exercise it  would be open to the petitioner to raise that  point  in appeal  on  the basis of facts on which he claims  that  the benefit of the larger period of limitation under the old law is  not  available  in  the  present  case  to  reopen   the assessment   for  the  assessment  years  1981-82   in   the petitioner’s  case and that the larger period under the  new law is not available because the same applies prospectively.

This appeal is directed against the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court dt.13.12.2005 in C.R.P.No.1177 of 2005. Before the High Court, it was submitted by the appellant herein (D.Gopinathan Pillai) that the delay in filing an application for setting aside the award was only 30 days and there was absolutely no explanation for the inordinate delay of 3320 days in filing the appeal. The High Court without going into the merits of the delay petition  has, however, observed that the application to set aside the award is ultimately dismissed then the appellant cannot be said to be aggrieved and that if the said petition is ultimately allowed and the arbitral award passed in favour of the appellant is set aside then his remedy is to file an appeal under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and that the appellant can challenge the impugned order in that appeal, in case, the petition to set aside the award happened to be decided against the appellant.  Reserving the said right to the appellant, the Civil Revision Petition was dismissed by the High Court. Our attention was also drawn to the order passed by the Principal Sub Judge, Thiruvananthapuram dt.30.09.2005 in I.A.No.1309/2005 in O.P.(Arb.) 78/1995 which was filed by the State of Kerala against the appellant herein.  The court has considered whether the delay of 3320 days in filing the petition to set aside the award can be condoned.  We have perused the entire order.  However, without assigning any acceptable reason, Principal Sub Judge, Thiruvananthapuram has condoned the inordinate delay of 3320 days and allowed the I.A. filed by the State of Kerala.  While condoning the delay, the learned Sub Judge has also observed that the officers of the State of Kerala has committed gross negligence in not filing the objection for a long period of 3320 days and, therefore, for the fault of the officers, the State should not be penalised. We are unable to countenance the finding rendered by the Sub Judge and also the view taken by the High Court.  There is no dispute in regard to the delay of 3320 days in filing the petition for setting aside the award.  When a mandatory provision is not complied with and when the delay is not properly, satisfactorily and convincingly explained, the court cannot condone the delay, only on the sympathetic ground. The orders passed by the learned Sub Judge and also by the High Court are far from satisfactory.  No reason whatsoever has been given to condone the inordinate delay of 3320 days.  It is well-considered principle of law that the delay cannot be condoned without assigning any reasonable, satisfactory, sufficient and proper reason.  Both the courts have http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 miserably filed to comply and follow the principle laid down by this Court in catena of cases.  We, therefore, have no other option except to set aside the order passed by the Sub-Judge and as affirmed by the High Court.  We accordingly set aside both the orders and allow this appeal.

Rao and Attar Singh for the Appellant. 360 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 G.S. Ramaiah, and B. Parthasarthi for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH  MISRA, J. This appeal by the defendant is  by Special Leave and challenge is to the decision of a division bench  of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in a Letters  Patent appeal. Plaintiff asked for a decree for possession after  evic- tion  of the defendants and claimed mesne profits both  past and  future. Plaintiff and Veeraraju happened to be sons  of Ramamurty.  The two brothers had amicably partitioned  their properties  in 1909. Veeraraju died in 1927  leaving  behind his widow. As Ramamurty sold certain properties from  Veera- raju’s share in 1928, the widow raised dispute and mediators brought  about  a settlement leading to the execution  of  a Deed  of Settlement dated August 18, 1937, whereunder  Rama- murty  settled  certain properties on the  widow  with  life interest and upon her death, those properties were to revert to  Ramamurty  or his heirs. After the  widow’s  death,  the plaintiff who is son of Ramamurty claimed the properties but defendant No. 1 who is the brother of the widow set up title thereto under a Will dated May 14, 1962 of the widow. The  main question that arose for consideration  in  the courts  below was whether the life-estate created in  favour of  Veeraraju’s  widow under the Settlement  Deed  had  been transformed  into full ownership under section 14(1) of  the Hindu Succession Act of 1956. All the three courts have held that  the life estate carved out under the  1937  settlement did  not get transformed into title in favour of  the  widow and  she  did  not acquire any  alienable  interest  in  the properties to bequeath in favour of her brother. The only question which has been canvassed at the  hear- ing is whether in the facts of the ease, sub-section (1)  or sub-section  (2) of section 14 of the Act is applicable.  It is  not  disputed that sub-section (2) of section 14  is  an exception to sub-section (1) thereof and if the situation is covered by sub-section (2), the transformation provided  for in sub-section (1) would not take place. The Settlement Deed is an instrument contemplated  under sub-section  (2)  and  admittedly it  created  a  restricted estate in favour of the widow. Therefore, sub-section (1) of section  14  would not be attracted. The submission  of  the appellant’s learned counsel that the Settlement deed brought the  properties  covered  by it in exchange or  in  lieu  of properties unauthorisedly alienated by Ramamurty and as  the widow had full title in the alienated 361 property,  title must be held to have accrued in  favour  of the widow in the properties covered by the settlement cannot be accepted. The appeal fails and is dismissed. Parties are directed to bear their own costs in this  Court. M.L.A.

" J U D G M E N T MARKANDEY KATJU, J. 1.      This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Delhi High Court dated 21.3.2000 in Civil Writ Petition No.1311 of 2000. 2.      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 3.      The facts of the case are that the respondent joined the Central Secretariat Service on 13.7.1983 after passing Assistants Grade Examination held in October, 1981.  The respondent was allocated to the finance cadre comprising the Ministry of Finance. 4.      After completion of eight years of regular service in the grade of Assistant, the respondent was granted a short-term promotion to the grade of Section Officer on 24.7.1991.  The respondent continues to work in this post till date. 5.      Select List (Seniority quota) for promotion to the Section Officers Grade for the year 1991 was issued on 28th May, 1993.  The respondent\022s name has not been included in this select list although the respondent was qualified to be included in the select list.  Officers junior to the respondent who have secured lower rank in the Assistant Grade Examination 1981 have been included in the select list for Section Officers 1991. 6.      The seniority list of Assistants Grade had been issued on 1st October, 1990.  In this list the respondent ranks at S.N.29 whereas other officers of the same grade at S.Nos.30, 32, 34, 25 and so on who are junior to the respondent in this seniority list have superseded the respondent and promoted as Section Officer on the basis of the Select List of 1991. Promotion to the post of section officers from the grade of Assistant to the grade of Section Officers (seniority quota) is on non-selection basis, based only on seniority. 7.      The grievance of the respondent was that her juniors were included in the select list but her name was not so included.  Hence, she filed an O.A. before the Central Administrative Tribunal. 8.      In the counter affidavit filed before the Tribunal the appellant herein (respondent before the Tribunal) alleged that the respondent was not eligible for inclusion in the Select List of 1991, since on 1.7.1991 she was short of the minimum eligibility service requirement of eight years by twelve days. The respondent joined as Assistant on 13.7.1983 and as such she could not be placed on the select list. 9.      The Tribunal allowed the O.A. by its order dated 24.9.1999.  In the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 said O.A. it was hold that the Department of Personnel and Training had issued an Office Memorandum dated 19.7.1989 soon after the decision of this Court in R. Prabha Devi and others  vs.  Government of IndiaThrough Secretary, Ministry of Personnel and Training, Administrative Reforms and others 1988(2) SCC 233 stating that where the junior had completed the eligibility requirement of promotion then their seniors will also be considered even if they have not completed the eligibility period. 10.     The appellant filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court which was dismissed and hence this appeal. 11.     It may be noted that the respondent was offered appointment vide letter dated 5.7.1983 which is after 1.7.1983 from which the eligibility was to be counted.  Hence, it is the Department which is to blame for sending the letter offering appointment after 1.7.1983.  In fact, some of the candidates who were junior to the respondent were issued letters offering appointment prior to 1.7.1983.  Hence it was the Department which is to blame for this. Moreover, in view of the Office Memorandum of the Department of Personnel and Training dated 18.3.1988 and 19.7.1989 the respondent was also to be considered, otherwise a very incongruous situation would arise namely that the junior will be considered for promotion but the senior will not. 12.     In view of the above there is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed.","The appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Delhi High Court dated 21.3.2000 in Civil Writ Petition No.1311 of 2000.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) NO. 731 OF 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court dismissing the Criminal Writ Petition no. 1770/2004 filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the ’Constitution’). Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Appellants are facing trial for alleged commission of offences punishable under Sections 306, 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’). The case of the prosecution is that Sharmila, daughter of the complainant was married to appellant no.3 and appellant nos. 1, 2 and 4 are her father-in-law, brother-in-law and mother- in-law respectively.  The Sessions Case No. 3791 of 2003 is pending trial in the Court of IV Additional Sessions Judge, Thane.  An application was filed before the Trial Court by the complainant through the prosecuting counsel for producing the death certificate dated 10.4.2004 indicating cause of death as certified by Dr. R.M. Dhotre.  The accused persons opposed acceptance of the document as evidence on the ground that along with police papers a certificate of death, dated 18.5.2000 by Dr. R.M. Dhotre, was filed which stated the probable cause of death to be cardio respiratory failure due to acute respiratory failure. In the subsequent certificate a different cause of death was indicated.  That being so, it was submitted that the subsequent certificate should not be taken on record. The Trial Court held that the production of the certificate dated 10.4.2004 cannot be decided at that stage as prosecution has not explained as to how the certificate was sought to be brought on record after 4 years.  Therefore, the matter relating to production of the certificate was kept in abeyance to be decided after examination of Dr. R.M. Dhotre. On the same date another application was filed for adding charge under Section 304B IPC. The trial Court accepted this prayer which was affirmed by the High Court. Same is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It was submitted that the trial Court having already decided in the connected application that the question of accepting the subsequent document would be taken up after the examination of doctor, should not have altered the charge primarily based on the same document. In response, learned counsel for the respondent-State submitted that the charge can be altered at any time and there is nothing wrong in the order passed by the Trial Court.  It is submitted that since charge can be altered at any stage,  no prejudice has been caused to the accused. There is no quarrel with the proposition that the charge can be altered at any stage. But the question is whether in view of the order passed on the same date the order relating to alteration of charge has been passed by the Trial Court.  It is to be noted that the Trial Court itself noted that as per the first certificate the cause of death was cardio respiratory failure due to acute respiratory failure. It, however, noted that some chemicals were noted in the viscera.  The effect of the presence of those chemicals has necessarily to be considered in the background of both the subsequent certificates, in case the latter certificate is taken on record.  That being so, it would be proper for the Trial Court to defer the question of framing charge under Section 304B after examination of Dr. R.M. Dhotre and relevance of the subsequent certificate and its acceptability. The High Court has failed to consider the relevant aspects and, should not have dismissed the application. The impugned order is set aside. The appeal is allowed.","Appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court dismissing the Criminal Writ Petition no. 1770/2004 filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, 1950.",appointment,26.98
" JUDGMENT O R D E R R.C. Lahoti, J. By these petitions under Section 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the petitioners herein seek Original Suit No.865 of 1997 titled as ""Lt. Gen. M.L. Dar (Ret’d.) and Ors.  Vs.  Sri. Vikram Singh and Ors."" pending in the Court of Addl. District Judge- II/FTC, Dehradun, Uttaranchal, being transferred to a court of competent jurisdiction at Delhi.  F.A.O. 52 (D)/2002 pending at High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital titled ""Himalayan Institute Hospital Trust and Ors.  Vs.  Sri Vikram Singh and Ors."" is also sought to be transferred to the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi.  F.A.O. 52 (D)/2002 is an offshoot of other pending litigation between the parties. The prayer for transfer has been opposed on behalf of the respondents. It is noteworthy that vide Order dated 24.11.03 passed in S.L.P. (c) Nos.11517-11518 of 2003, on the learned counsel for the parties agreeing for this Court exercising its jurisdiction under Section 25 of the CPC for transferring two other proceedings pending in two courts between the parties for hearing and decision in one court, this Court has directed Testamentary Case No.1 of 2002 pending in the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital and Letter of Administration Case No.26 of 2002 pending in High Court of Delhi (Original Side) at Delhi, to be transferred for hearing and decision to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Bench seat at Lucknow.  The said order of transfer has been carried out and the two matters are now before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Bench seat at Lucknow, for hearing and decision in its Original Jurisdiction. Though the prayer for transfer has been opposed on behalf of the respondents, having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are of the opinion that the suit which is now sought to be transferred is definitely associated with the two matters already ordered to be transferred. Although initially we were reluctant to accede to the present prayer for transfer, however, at the end, we have formed an opinion that the ends of justice demand such transfer being ordered. Accordingly, Original Suit No.865 of 1997 titled as ""Lt. Gen. M.L. Dar (Ret’d.) and Ors.  Vs.  Sri. Vikram Singh and Ors."" pending before Addl. District Judge-II/FTC, Dehradun, Uttaranchal and F.A.O. 52 (D)/2002 pending in the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital titled ""Himalayan Institute Hospital Trust and Ors.  Vs.  Sri Vikram Singh and Ors."", are directed to be transferred for hearing and decision at Lucknow Bench Seat of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 So far as the suit is concerned we are conscious that already over-burdened High Court shall have another original suit added to its pendency and the learned Presiding Judge shall have to record evidence.  We, therefore, feel inclined to make an observation that the learned Presiding Judge now seized of the hearing of the suit pursuant to this order of transfer, may liberally exercise his power of permitting recording of evidence on commission excepting for such witnesses who are very material and who the learned Judge, in his discretion, feels necessary must appear before him that the demeanour of any witness may need to be watched and so on. The transfer petitions stand disposed of.  The learned Additional District Judge-II/FTC, Dehradun, Uttaranchal and the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital shall, soon on communication of this order, transmit the records to the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Bench Seat at Lucknow.

" O R D E R Though the  respondent has  been served,  he  does  not appear either  in  person  or  through  counsel.  Notice  is sufficient. Leave granted. The respondent  was detained  on July  31,  1989  under Section 3  [1] (iii) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and  Prevention   of  Smuggling   Activities  Act.  When  he challenged the  order of  detention, the  High Court  in the impugned order  dated July  25, 1990 made in W.P. No.2029 of 1990 set aside the order of detention on the ground that the delay in  non-consideration of  the representation  for  one month, i.e.,  from February  20, 1990 to March 15, 1990, was not explained and also on the ground that copy of the report of the  sponsoring authority  had not  been supplied  to the detenu which violates Article 22 [5] of the Constitution. We are of  the opinion  that the  High Court  was not  right in setting aside the order of detention on these grounds. It is not mandatory  that the  report of  the sponsoring authority should be supplied to the detenu under Article 22 [5] of the Constitution.  It  is  only  a  material  furnished  to  the detaining authority.  All the material on which reliance was place for  order of detention was admittedly supplied to the detenu. In  the facts  and circumstances  of this  case, the delay in  disposal of  the representation  of about  23 days also is not fatal. Under these  circumstances, the order of the High Court setting  aside  the  detention  order  is  clearly  illegal. However, since  the period  has already  expired, we  do not think that  it is a case warranting further detention of the respondent.

" O R D E R Application for  substitution and  appointment of legal guardian is ordered. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, made on May  7, 1980  in RSA No.602/80 confirming the judgment of the District Court dated November 7, 1979. The admitted position is that one Gobind Mal, father of the respondents, had possessory mortgage from the holders of the suit  land in  the  year  1887-88.  When  the  land  was declared as  an evacuee  property under the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act,  1951, the Union of India claimed the land belonged to  them. The  respondents filed a civil suit for a declaration that  after the expiry of the period of 60 years from the  date of  the mortgage,  they have  become absolute owners  as   the  mortgage  became  irredeemable  and  as  a consequence they  are the  owner of the property. Though the trial Court  has dismissed  the  suit,  on  appeal,  it  was reversed and  decree was  granted. The  High  Court  in  the second appeal  confirmed it  by dismissing  in limine. Thus, this appeal by special leave. From the  evidence on  record, it is seen that mutation entries have been effected to show that the respondents were in possession  of the  property as  mortgagees  through  the tenants. That  evidence was corroborated by DW-2, Kanugo and the mutation  order DW-2/1.  The District  Court also relied upon  Jamabandi   for  the   year   1887-88.   Under   those circumstances, the  mutation in  regard to  year 1896-97  is only referable  to the  earlier mortgage  of 1886-87.  As  a consequence, by  the time  the Act  has come into force, the land  became   irredeemable  by   the  original   mortgagor. Resultantly, they had lost title to the typothica, The title to  the   land  was   rightly  declared  to  belong  to  the respondents and  it cannot  be  declared  to  be  a  evacuee property nor  the Government  can claim interest in the land as evacuee  property.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We   do   not   find   any   justification   warranting interference in this appeal. The only point before the Revenue Tribunal and the High Court was of the title. For valid reasons the contention was rejected. Admittedly, there  was a  suit for  possession  by  the rival  reversioners.   The  appellants-landlords   were  the defendants  in   the  suit.   The  suit  ended  against  the landlords-appellants and thereby the title remained with the other  side  of  the  reversioners.  Since  the  respondents remained in  possession for  more than  12 years  they  have prescribed title  by adverse  possession.  That  apart,  the appellants’ having entered into a tenancy agreement with the respondents they  are estopped  under  Section  116  of  the Evidence Act  to deny  the title  of the  landlords.  Having these insurmountable  difficulties in  the  way,  Shri  G.N. Ganpule,  learned   senior  counsel   for  the   appellants, contended that when a notice was issued to the appellants to pay Nazrana  after the  abolition of  wattan, the appellants had paid  the same  and thereby became entitled to remain in possession  and   Section  31  of  the  Bombay  Tenancy  and Agricultural  Lands  Act,  1948  has  no  application.  This contention  was   rejected  by   the  appellate  authorities recording the  finding that the respondents paid the Nazrana but this finding was not canvassed either before the Revenue Tribunal or  the High  Court.

As he  was  acquitted under Section 302 IPC, the State filed Crl. A. No. 483/96. The High  Court  dismissed  the  appeal  filed  by  the appellant,  allowed  the  appeal  filed  by  the  State  and convicted the  appellant for the offence of murder also. The High  Court  then  observed  that  when  the  appellant  was convicted for  the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC, the question  whether he  should also  be convicted  for the offence punishable under Section 304-B became academic. It  was   the  prosecution   case  that  the  appellant committed the  death of  his wife  and daughter. In order to prove  its  case.  the  prosecution  had  examined  10  eye- witnesses and  produced three  dying declarations.  PWs 1-10 did into  support the  prosecution. The  trial court relying upon the  three dying  declarations convicted the appellant. The High  Court also  found that the three dying declaration were genuine  and truthful  and relying  upon them  held the appellant quilty. What is  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant is  that the  dying declarations  - Ex.  P. 23 and Ex. P. 33 ought not to have been relied upon as they contain improvements. He  further pointed out that in the last dying declaration a  clear attempt  was made to involve the father of the  appellant who  has now  been acquitted  by the  High Court.  Because   of  some   doubt  arising   therefrom  the appellant’s father was given benefit of doubt. That does not necessarily mean  that it  was not  genuine. In any case, it does  not   have  nay   bearing  upon  the  genuineness  and truthfulness of  the first  dying declaration  -Ex.  P.  26, which was  recorded by  the Additional  First Class Judicial magistrate  after   ascertaining  the  physical  and  mental fitness of the person making It. In that declaration she has clearly stated that she was set on fire by her husband. We see  no reason to discard that dying declaration.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R 1.      The prosecution case, in brief, is that  on 21.2.1999 at    about    11 a.m.,   when the prosecutrix was returning to her house after working in the brickfield of Mahadeb Bera, then near Laltanrd jungle, appellant-accused came from behind on a cycle, molested her, put his napkin (gamchha) inside her mouth and forcibly raped her. Appellant-accused also threatened her not to disclose the matter to anyone; otherwise he would kill all her family members.  After returning to her house, the prosecutrix narrated the incident to her sister (P.W.5) who, in turn, narrated it to their mother (P.W. 2).  PW. 2 waited for her husband (PW 4) to return and  after informing him, she went to the police station with the prosecutrix and lodged an F.I.R. against the appellant-accused. 2.            Appellant-accused was charged under Sections 341/376 of  Indian Penal  Code (in short \023IPC\024). By the judgment and order dated 27.3.2003, the  Sessions Judge, Purulia found the appellant-accused guilty and sentenced him to suffer R.I. for ten years for the commission of offence under Section 376 IPC and for the charge under Section  341 IPC, he was sentenced to suffer R.I. for six months. 3.      Appellant-accused filed an appeal before the High Court challenging his conviction passed by the Sessions Judge.  The High Court, by the impugned judgment dated 29.11.2005, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of  the appellant-accused. 4.      Aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court, the appellant-accused has preferred the present appeal by special leave. 5.      We have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the evidence on record. 6.           The statement of prosecutrix has been corroborated by the F.I.R. lodged by her in the police station and also  by her sister PW 5 Putibala Paramanik to whom the entire incident was narrated by the prosecutrix immediately. 7.      We have minutely gone through the judgment delivered by the Sessions Judge as well as that of the  High Court.  We do not find  any infirmity in the judgment of the Sessions Judge and th impugned judgment delivered by the High Court confirming the sentence of the appellant.  The  appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.","On 21.2.1999 at    about   11 a.m.,   when the prosecutrix was returning to her house after working in the brickfield of Mahadeb Bera, then near Laltanrd jungle, appellant-accused came from behind on a cycle, molested her, put his napkin (gamchha) inside her mouth and forcibly raped her.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The admitted  position is  that  the  Commissioner  had invited tenders  on December  21, 1996 for supply of country made liquor  in various districts of U.P. for the year 1996- 97. Pursuant  thereto, parties  had submitted there tenders. The commissioner  by his proceedings dated February 27, 1996 allotted to  the Co-operative Distillery Co, Ltd., the third respondent, the  Districts of  Saharanpur and  Haridwar, He, however, revoked the same by his proceedings dated March 27, 1996 and allotted the district of Haridwar to the appellant. Consequently,  the  third  respondent  filed  writ  petition challenging  the   cancellation  and   reallotment  to   the appellant of  Haridwar  District.  the  High  Court  in  the impugned order has directed in the operative part as under: ""In the  result, the  writ petition is   allowed   and   orders   dated 26.3.1996 and  27.3.1996  contained in Annexures  6 and 6-A to the writ petition so  far as  it pertains to the allotment  of district Haridwar to respondent  No.3 are  quashed. A mandamus is  also issued commanding the respondents  1 and 2 to restore the position  as it was obtained on 27.2.1996 and  the opp. parties are also restrained from interfering in the rights  of the  petitioners  to make   supply   to   the   district Haridwar."" Calling this  order in question, the present appeal has been filed. Clause 18(c)  of the  Tender Conditions  indicated that ""[1]f  all   the  aforesaid  conditions  are  fulfilled  the distillery  situated   in  the   district  would   be  given preference in  respect of supplies to the same. If there are two distilleries  situated in the same district and if there is no  material difference  in the  rates quoted by the said two distilleries,  the distillery,  which  was  granted  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 district earlier, shall be given preference."" It is an admitted position that prior to bifurcation of districts saharanpur  and Haridwar,  Haridwar  was  part  of Saharanpur. It  is also  an admitted  position that  on  the earlier occasion,  the third  respondent was granted licence for Saharanpur  and Haridwar,  The question remains: whether the factory  of the third respondent is situated in Haridwar district?  It   is  an  admitted  position  that  the  third respondent’s factory  is not  situated in Haridwar district. It is also an admitted position that the respondent No.3 had not executed  the agreement  for the  purpose of issuance of the licence.  As a  result, no licence had been issued as on date. On  these  facts,  the  question  arises:  whether  the allotment to the third respondent is correct in law? We need not express  any opinion on the facts since, admittedly, the Government did  not issue  any notice respondent on February 27, 1996 and the third respondent had no opportunity to have his say in that behalf. Under these  circumstances, the direction issued by the High Court  stands set  aside. The Government is directed to issue  notice  to  the  third  respondent  as  well  as  the appellant, consider  their objections  and pass  appropriate speaking in  that behalf  for grant or refusal of licence in respect of district of Haridwar in accordance with the Rules to the 3rd Respondent.

" J U D G M E N T The  appellant   is  challenging  in  this  appeal  his conviction under  Section 302  read with  Section 34 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act recorded by Sessions Court, Patna in Sessions  Case No.86  of 1976  and confirmed  by the High Court in Criminal Appeal No.57 of 1976. Learned counsel  for the  appellant took us through the evidence of  eye-witnesses who  have said  that the deceased was hit  on his back by the shot fired by the appellant. But P.W.5  -   Doctor  Kalwar,  who  had  performed  post-mortem examination has  deposed that  entry wound  was on the chest and  the  exit  wound  was  on  the  back.  Learned  counsel submitted that the medical evidence clearly establishes that the assailant  had fired a shot when the deceased was facing him and  not when  his back  was towards  the assailant, was deposed by  the eye-witnesses.  He submitted that is view of this inconsistency,  the courts  below  ought  not  to  have accepted their evidence. This aspect  was considered by the trial court and also by the  High  Court  and  they  have  rightly  rejected  the contention same.  The Doctor,  who performed the post-mortem examination, as  admitted that  he had  prepared  the  post- mortem report  subsequently in  his office  on the  basis of notes which he had prepared earlier and which were destroyed thereafter. He  also admitted that the appellant was working as a  compounder in a Government hospital. That explains the reason why  there is an inconsistency in the evidence of Dr. kalwar  and  of  Dr.  Singh,  who  first  examined  deceased Mahinder Singh,  P.W. 6-  Dr. Singh not only in his evidence but also  in the Injury Certificate which he had issued soon after examining  Mahinder Singh  has described  the wound on the back as an entry wound and the wound on the chest as the exit wound.  Nothing was  elicited in  his cross-examination which  could create a doubt regarding the correctness of his evidence. An  attempt by  the Doctor who had performed post- mortem examination  to help the appellant is quite evidence. This cannot  be regarded  as a  case  in  which  because  of inconsistency between  the ocular  evidence and  the medical evidence, the  evidence of  eye-witnesses should  have  been rejected. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We see  no reason  to differ from the findings recorded by the  High Court.  The evidence  of eye-witnesses  clearly establishes that  the appellant  had  caused  the  death  of Mahinder Singh by firing a gun. This appeal  is, therefore,  dismissed. The appellant’s bail is  cancelled an  he is ordered to surrender to custody to serve out the remaining sentence.","The appellant is challenging his conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act.

" O R D E R Leave granted. we have heard the counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises  from the  order, made on  September 23,  1996 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in F.A. No. 784/94. The respondent  had  booked  commercial  vehicle,  more commonly known  as a ’Tipper Truck’ with registration No. SK 1210/b/36 on  May 7,  1991. He  purchased the  vehicle after securing loans  from a nationalised Bank on usual commercial rate of  interest. After  running the vehicle as driver-cum- owner for  9000 Kms.  it was  found that the tyres were worn out completely,  front axil  pins of  the vehicle  were  not fixed properly; at a speed of 40 Kms. per hour the vibration of the  vehicle (empty)  was very  high  as  the  cabin  was completely loose  etc. He  mentioned these  defects  in  his letter   dated    March   10,1992,   after   eight   months. Subsequently,  he  reiterated  the  same  in  his  different letters  addressed   to  the  agent,  through  whom  he  had purchased the vehicle. Finally, by letter dated May 2, 1992, after intimating  that in  spite of  running the vehicle for 18000 to  18500 kms.,  despite repairs, the vehicle continue to give  the same  trouble. In  spite  of  the  Warranty  of Service, the  trouble was  not done  away.  Accordingly,  he filed a  complaint with the State commission. The commission after   considering the  evidence and hearing the counsel on both sides,  found that  the appellant  was liable  to pay a total amount of Rs. 4,81,132-17 with interest at the rate of 18% per  annum w.e.f.  July 28,1992.  That was  confirmed on appeal by  the National  Commission.  thus  this  appeal  by special leave. Shri F.S. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant  contends that the appellant is not so much on the quantification  of the  damages awarded  in  this  case; rather, they  want to  vindicate the  principle on which the damages are awarded in such type of complaints. According to him, the  complaint was laid after 8 months from the date of the delivery; that too after the vehicle was used to cover a distance of  18000 to  18500 Kms.; the complaint was laid in August 1992. When the Commissioner appointed gave his report on April  10,1993, the vehicle had cover a distance of 65000 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 kms. The  State commission  passed the  order  on  September 24,1994 by  which date  a  further  distance  of  more  than another 25000 to 30000 kms. would have been run. Under these circumstances,  proportionate   deduction  for  use  of  the vehicle would  have been  run.  under  these  circumstances, proportionate deduction  for use  of the  Vehicle would have been run. Under these circumstances, proportionate deduction for use  of the vehicle would have been given. We find force in the  contention. It  is not  the case that during the sai period the vehicle was kept used. When the vehicle was being used with  the same  defects as pointed out, necessarily the purchaser is  required to  be compensated for not delivering the vehicle  in good  condition as  per the  warranty  after deduction towards  the use  of the  vehicle. In  view of the facts  and   circumstances,  we  think  that  1/3rd  of  the compensation awarded  by  the  Commission  may  by  deducted towards the  user of the vehicle for the period in question. For the  rest of  the amount, the order of the Commission is confirmed . The appeal is accordingly allowed in part.

The suit  was for  possession of  the property from the appellant. The plaintiff is the mother-in- law of  the appellant. The appellant and her husband are not able to  live amicably  in matrimonial  tie. The proceedings for divorce  are pending.  The appellant is in possession of the property  and, therefore,  the  respondent-mother-in-law filed a  suit for  possession on  the basis  of her  alleged title.

Hence, this  appeal  by special leave. In view  of the  fact  that  the  parties  are  closely related and the matter has been disposed of ex-parte. we are of the  view that  it is  not a  fit case to impose costs of depositing mense  profits from  the date  of ex-parte decree and to  continue to deposit it as a condition to contest the application to  set aside  ex-parte decree.  Moreover,  such onerous condition is not valid, though discretionary.

They  felt aggrieved  by  the  notifications  dated  December  5,  1988 whereby Rule  2544 of the Indian Railways Establishment Code was amended  and for  the purpose  of calculation of average emoluments  the   maximum  limit   in  respect   of  Running Allowances was  reduced from 75% to 45% in respect of period from January  1, 1973  to March  31, 1979 and to 55% for the period from April 1, 1979 onwards. The validity of the retrospective amendments introduced by the  impugned notifications  dated December  5, 1988  had been considered  by the  Full Bench  of the  Tribunal in its judgment dated December 16, 1993 in O.A. No. 395-403 of 1993 and connected  matters and  the said notifications in so far as they  gave retrospective  effect to  the amendments  were held to  be invalid  as being violative a Articles 14 and 16 of the  Constitution.   Since the  appellants were adversely affected by the impugned amendments, they sought the benefit of the  Full Bench of the Tribunal by filing representations before the  Railway Administration.   Since  they failed  to obtain redress,  they filed the application (O.A. NO. 774 of 1994) seeking relief before the Tribunal in April 1994.  The said application  of the  appellants was  dismissed  by  the Tribunal by  the impugned  judgment on  the  view  that  the application was  barred by limitation.  The Tribunal refused to condone the delay in the filing of the said applications.

The  appeal  is,  therefore,  allowed,  the impugned judgment of the Tribunal is set aside, the delay in filing of  O.A. No.  774 of  199 is  condoned and  the  said application is allowed.

But  as the  respondent has  been working right from 1976 and  as no  clear finding  has  been  recorded  by  the authority establishing  breach of  the said instructions, we do not think that this is a care warranting interference. It will  be   open  to   appellants  to  have  the  post-master transferred to any other place.

" O R D E R The submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that there  is non-compliance  of Section 50 of the narcotic Drugs and  psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short ""the N.D.P.S.  Act"")   which  renders   the  conviction   of  the petitioner illegal.  The learned  counsel submitted, placing reliance on  the decision  of this  Court  in  Saiyad  Mohd. Saiyad Umar  Saiyad and Ors. vs. State of Gujarat, (1995 (3) SCC 610), that the burden is on the prosecution to prove due compliance  of  Section  50  of  the  N.D.P.S.  Act.  It  is sufficient to  say that  in the present case, the High Court has gone  into this  question and  recorded a  clear finding that there  was compliance of Section 50 of the N.D.P.s. Act inasmuch as  the accused  was given  the option specified in the provision  and on  exercise of  the at option by him, he was searched in the presence of a Gazetted Officer. Learned counsel  or the  petitioner  further  submitted that another  requirement of  Section 50 of the N.D.P.S. Act is that  the accused  should also  be given  the  option  to choose whether he wanted to be searched in the presence of a Gazetted Officer  or in  the presence of a magistrate. It is submitted that  this further  option was  not given  to  the petitioner in the present case. We are unable to accept such a construction  of  Section  50  of  the  N.D.P.S.  Act,  he provision only  requires the  option  to  be  given  to  the accused to  say whether  he would like to be searched in the present of  a Gazetted  Officer  of  a  Magistrate;  and  on exercise of  that option  by the  accused,  it  is  for  the officer concerned to have the search made in the presence of the nearest  Gazetted  Officer  or  the  nearest  Magistrate whosoever is conveniently available for the purpose in order to avoid  undue delay  in completion of that exercise. It is clear from  Section 50  of the  N.D.P.S. Act that the option given thereby  to the  accused is  only to choose whether he would like  to be  searched by the officer taking the search or in  the presence of the nearest available Gazette Officer http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 or the  nearest available  Magistrate.  The  choice  of  the nearest Gazetted Officer or the nearest Magistrate has to be exercised by  the officer  making the  search and not by the accused.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION :  Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 6331/78. From  the  Judgment  and  Order  dated  1-6-78  of  the Karnataka High Court at Bangalore in T.R.C. No. 1/75 R.  N.   Sachthey  and   Miss  A.   Subhashni  for  the Petitioner. The Order of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.  This petition for special leave to appeal against an  order of  the High  Court of  Karnataka raises a question of  interpretation of section 10 of the Estate Duty Act, 1953.  The deceased  made a  gift  of  his  residential property to his wife on 27th November, 1957 and on his death which occurred  on 2nd  August,  1963,  the  question  arose whether the  value of the residential property was liable to be included  in the principal value of the estate passing on the death  of the deceased under section 10. The argument of the Revenue  was that  even  after  the  gift  the  deceased http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 continued to reside with the wife and, therefore, it 952 could not  be said  that the  wife retained  possession  and enjoyment  of   the  residential   property  to  the  entire exclusion  of   the  deceased   and  hence  section  10  was attracted. Now  there can  be no  doubt  that  on  a  proper interpretation  of   section  10,   the  donee  must  retain possession and  enjoyment of  the  property  gifted  to  the entire exclusion  of  the  donor,  in  order  to  repel  the applicability of  that section. But we do not see how in the present case  it can  at all  be said  that the wife did not retain possession  and enjoyment of the residential house to the exclusion  of the  deceased, merely because the deceased in his  capacity as  husband continued  to reside  with  the wife. Section  10 cannot  possibly be  construed in a manner which would  require the  husband who has gifted residential house to  the wife  to live separately from her, if he wants to escape  from  the  mischief  of  that  section.  Such  an interpretation would  subvert family  life and  social order and would  be contrary  to morality and good sense. When the residential house  is gifted  to the  wife and  she  obtains possession and remains in enjoyment of it, it cannot be said that the  husband who  resides with  the wife, as in a happy family life  every husband  would be  expected to do, is, on that account,  in possession  of the residential house or in enjoyment of  it. It  is the  wife who  is in possession and enjoyment of  the residential  house  and  the  husband,  by reason of  the marital  ties, continues  to reside  with the wife. We  do not  think that  section 10  would  at  all  be attracted in such a case. We find  that this  view has been taken by the Calcutta High Court  in Mrs.  Shamsum Nehar  Mansur v.  Controller of Estate Duty,  West Bengal(1)  and Sunil Roy v. Controller of Estate Duty,  Calcutta(2), the  Andhra Pradesh High Court in Mohammed Bhai  and another  v. Controller of Estate Duty,(3) the Madras  High Court  in Kamla  Pandalai v.  Controller of Estate Duty,(4) and the Karnataka High Court in the judgment under appeal  and it  commends itself  to us.  We think that theise High  Courts rightly refused to apply section 10 to a case like  the present  where the  husband  has  gifted  the residential house  to the  wife and  thereafter continued to reside with  the wife in the residential house. The contrary view taken  by the Allahabad High Court in Bibi Ahmedi Begum v. Controller  of Estate  Duty, U.P.  (5) must be held to be erroneous. We accordingly reject the special leave petition. M. R.                                    Petition dismissed. 953","The deceased made a gift of his residential property to his wife on 27th November, 1957.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  High Court of Patna, made on December 7.1993 in CWJC no 11515/92. The  admitted  position  is  that  the  respondent  was appointed as  a Government servant in June 1950 and was sent on Deputation  to the  Appellant-Board on August 4, 1959. He was absorbed  in the  Electricity Board on November 25, 1970 and retired  from service on April 30, 1984. The question is : as  to for  which period  the Board  is liable  to pay the pension to  the respondent?  The High Court found that since he was  on deputation  from the Government service from June 1950 to  August 1959,  the appellant-board  should  pay  the pension and  recover proportionately  the pension  from  the Government. The  Government had declined to bear that burden and, therefore,  the Board  has come  up in  appeal in  this matter. we  have issued  the notice to the State Government. The State Government have filed the counter. It is stated in the counter  affidavit that under Bihar pension Rules Part 2 Appendix 5-2(iii),  unless a Government servant completes 10 years of  service in the State Government service, he is not entitled to  the pension proportionately. thereafter, notice was issued  to the  respondent-employee. It  is contended by respondent-employee that  the respondent had not voluntarily gone on  deputation, but  when we read out the averment made in the  affidavit filed  in the  High Court, we find that he had not  specifically stated so. Subsequently, he so pleaded in the  counter affidavit  filed in  this Court  that he was sent on  deputation to  the Electricity  Board  against  his wishes. Under  these circumstances,  we  cannot  decide  the controversy  in   this  appeal  though  the  respondent  has asserted to  that effect.  admittedly, for  the  period  the respondent was  under the Board’s service, he is entitled to the pension  and is  being paid w.e.f. the month in which he was sent  on deputation.  The actual controversy pertains to the period  from June  1950 to  august 1959.  In view of the fact that  this is  a disputed  question, appropriate course would  be   that  the   respondent-employee  should  make  a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 representation to  the Government and Bihar State Government would  consider  and  dispose  of  the  representation  with speaking order,  according to  law, within a period of three months from the date of the representation. The appeal  is accordingly  disposed of.  It is  stated that in  similar situation  some persons  whose  names  were furnished in  the application  were granted  benefits by the Government. It  appears that  the Board  has paid the amount pursuant to the direction of the High Court; it would be for the Board  to approach  the High  Court and take appropriate direction.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the High Court of Patna, made on December 7.1993 in CWJC no 11515/92.

" JUDGMENT 2001 (3) SCR 1053 The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave is granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court of Bombay, Aurangabad Bench in Civil Revision Application No. 884 of 1999 dated August 7,2000, declining to interfere with the order of the Additional District Judge, Amalner, dated March 16, 1998 dismissing Misc. Civil Application No. 21 of 1997. The appellant made that application for condonation of delay of 7 days in filing the appeal against the order of the trial court in Special C.S. No. 5/95 on the file of the Civil Judge, S.D. Amalner. A perusal of the order of the learned Additional District Judge shows that he found fault with the appellant on two grounds: (i) the judgement under appeal was delivered on April 30, 1997 but the application for certified copy was made on June 5, 1997 and (ii) in regard to the averment in the affidavit, filed in support of the application, her illness was given as a reason for the delay; it was pointed out that while she was still ill she filed the appeal. For those two reasons the application to condone the delay of seven days in filing the appeal was dismissed. It appears that the fact that during the period from May 1, 1997 to June 1,1997 the Court was in vacation, has escaped the attention of the learned Appellate Judge. To avert further delay in filing the appeal as soon as she felt a little better she filed the appeal. This depicts her anxiety to minimise the delay rather than falsity of her case or malafides. In exercising discretion under Section 5 of the Limitation Act the Courts should adopt a pragmatic approach. A distinction must be made between a case where the delay is inordinate and a case where the delay is of a few days. Whereas in the former case the consideration of prejudice to the other side will be a relevant factor so the case calls for a more cautious approach but in the latter case no such consideration may arise and such a case deserves a liberal approach. No hard and fast rule can be laid down in this regard. The Court has to exercise the discretion on the facts of each case keeping in mind that in construing the expression ’sufficient cause’ the principle of advancing substantial justice is of prime importance. In our view in this case, the approach of the learned Additional District Judge is wholly erroneous and his order is unsustainable. It is evident that the discretion under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is exercised by the Additional District Judge in contravention of the law laid down by this Court, that the expression ’sufficient cause’ should receive liberal construction, in catena of decisions (see State of West Bengal v. The Administrator, Howrah Municipality & Others, [1972] 1 SCC 366 and Smt. Sandhya Rani Sarkar v. Smt Sudha Rani Debt & Others, [1978] 2 SCC 116). The High Court in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 115 C.P.C. failed to correct the jurisdictional error of the Appellate Court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 For the aforementioned reasons, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court as well as also of the Additional District Judge, Amalner (the Appellate Court), condone the delay of seven days in filing the appeal, restore the appeal to the file of the Additional District Judge and direct the learned Additional District Judge, Amalner to decide the appeal on merits. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

" O R D E R In an  administrative suit,  the parties had agreed for sale of a property at Ootacamund in the State of Tamil Nadu. The receivers  appointed by  the Court  for the purpose sold the said  property. The appellants herein are the purchasers thereof. Some  of the  parties to the suit raised objections to the  sale purporting  to be  under Order 21, Rule 90 read with Section  151 CPC.  An objection  was raised  before the trial court  that such objections were not maintainable. The trial court  framed a  preliminary issue  and went  into the matter. It  rejected the application being not maintainable. The respondents herein took the matter in appeal to the High Court which was placed before a Division Bench for disposal. The High Court agreed with the trial court that an objection under Order 21, Rule 90 CPC to such a sale did not lie. But, since the  sale had  been effected  by the court through its appointed receivers,  the High  Court viewed  that the court had full  control and grip over the matter, empowering it to oversee whether  the sale had been properly conducted and if the was  any other  objection thereto, what was the merit of the objection. This role of the court was spelled out by the High Court  to be within the domain of Section 151 CPC which recognises and  preserves the  inherent powers  of the Civil Court. It is for that purpose that the High Court. It is for that purpose  that the  High Court  effected a remand to the trial court  to go  into the matter, holding the application filed by  the respondents  maintainable.  That  view  is  in question before this Court. After hearing  learned counsel  for the parties, we are in total  unison with the views expressed by the High Court. In an  administrative suit,  the receivers  appointed by the court to perform a function are agents of the court and like a good  principal,  the  court  can  put  the  receivers  to accountability. To  awaken the  role of  the court  in  that behalf, applications by the parties connected with the suit, are perfectly in order to obviate any doubt entering in that regard and  to effect  a sense  of transparency  so that  no blame or  aspersion is  cast on  the court  for  its  having handled the  matter in a particular way. The court’s role is of a balancer. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It has  also to  be borne  in mind  that  interests  of justice are  the primary  consideration in  granting or  not granting prayers  in a  petition under Sec. 151 CPC. No rule or procedure  can curtail  that power of the court. The High Court rightly  has pursued  that path  in permitting promote the cause  of justice.  We,  therefore,  see  no  reason  to interfere in the said order. The appeal,  therefore, fails  and is hereby dismissed, but without any order as to costs.","In an administrative suit, the parties had agreed for sale of a property at Ootacamund in the State of Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Prem Malhotra, Adv. for the Respondents. J U D G M E N T The following Judgement of the Court was delivered: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 5654-55 OF 1995 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) Nos. 12914-14A of 1989) State of Haryana                          .....Appellant V. Shanti Parshad Jain & Ors.                .....Respondents J U D G M E N T Mrs. Sujata V. Manohar, J. Delay condoned. Special leave granted. These  appeals  pertain  to  the land pertaining to the respondents which has been acquired pursuant to Notification dated 30.1.1973 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and Notification dated 24.7.1973 under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act,1894. The land has been acquired by the appellant   for   the  public  purpose  of  development  and utilisation of land in the urban estate to be set  up in the area of village Hissar. The Land  Acquisition  Collector  by  his  award  dated 5.9.1973 awarded  compensation to  the respondents  for  ‘A’ Category of  land at  the rate  of Rs. 20,000/- per acre and for ‘B’  Category at  the rate  of Rs.  12,000/-  per  acre. Aggrieved  by   this  award,  the  respondents  preferred  a reference under  Section 18  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act before the  Additional District  Judge, Hissar. By his order dated 23.1.1979,  the Additional District Judge enhanced the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 award amount  as set  out therein.  In an  appeal from  this order, the  High court  by its order dated 9.12.1988 further enhanced  the  compensation  amount  and  also  granted  the benefit of Sections 23(1A), 23(2) and 28 of the amended Land Acquisition Act to the respondents. The only  point urged  before us by the appellant is in respect of  the benefit granted under Sections 23(1A), 23(2) and 28 of the Land Acquisition Act to the respondents. In this case both the award of the Collector as well as the award by the court under a reference under Section 18 of the Land  Acquisition Act  have been  made prior  to 30th of April, 1982.  Hence the  benefit of Section 23(1A) cannot be extended to  the respondents. (See: K.S.Paripoornan v. State of Kerala & Ors. (1994 (5) SCC 593). The benefit of Sections 23(2) as well as 28 also is not available to  the respondents  in the  present case  because neither the  award of  the Collector  nor the  award by  the Court is  after 30.4.1982  and before  24.9.1984. Unless the appeal before  the High  Court or before us is in respect of the award  made  by  the  Collector  or  the  Court  between 30.4.1982 and  24.9.1984 the benefit of the amended Sections 23(2) and  28 cannot be granted in such appeals. (See: Union of India  & Anr. v. Raghubir Singh (dead) by Lrs. etc. (1989 (3) SCR 316). The appeals  are accordingly  allowed and  the order of the High  Court insofar  as it grants the benefit of amended Sections 23(1A),  23(2) and  28 to  the respondents,  is set aside.

No. 5851 of 1994) J U D G M E N T K. Venkataswami, J. A common  question of  law  arises  out  of  these  two appeals.   As a  matter of  fact, the High Court disposed of the two Miscellaneous Petitions by one order. The  appellant   framed  charges   against  the   first respondent in  each  of  the  appeals  for  certain  alleged misconduct committed by them.  The charge-sheets were issued by the  Director.    Medical  and  Health  Services  of  the appellant.   The delinquents challenged the charge-sheets on the only ground that their appointing authority/disciplinary authority being  the Managing Director of the appellant, the charge memo  issued by  the  Director,  Medical  and  Health Services was  invalid and of no consequence.  The appellant, however,  justified   the  issue   of  charge-sheet  by  the Director.   Medical & Health Services on the ground that the powers to initiate disciplinary action had been delegated to the Head  of the  Department who  enjoys a  rank of  General Manager.   The Director,  Medical and  Health Services,  who issued the  charge memos, admittedly come under the category of controlling authority. The High  court did  not accept  the contention  of the appellant (respondent  before the  High Court)  stating that the delegation of power has not been established. Before  us,  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the appellants, apart  from bringing  to our notice the relevant proceedings duly  delegating  the  power  to  the  Director, Medical and  Health Services,  invited our  attention  to  a recent decision  of this  Court in Director General. ESI vs. T.Abdul Razak  (1996  (4)  SCC  708).    In  that  case,  in answering an identical question, this Court held a follows:- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ""With  regard   to  initiation   of disciplinary  proceedings   by  the Regional Director, we find that the legal position is well settled that it  is   not  necessary   that  the authority competent  to impose  the penalty    must     initiate    the disciplinary proceedings  and  that the proceedings can be initiated by any superior  authority who  can be held   to    be   the   controlling authority who  may  be  an  officer subordinate   to   the   appointing authority (See:  State of  m.P.  v. Shardul   Singh;   P.V.   Srinivasa Sastry  v.   Controller  &  Auditor General and  Inspector  General  of Police  v.  General  and  Inspector General of Police v. Thavasiappan). The Regional  Director,  being  the officer-in-charge  of  the  region, was the  controlling  authority  in respect of  the  respondents.    He could  institute  the  disciplinary proceedings against the respondents even in  the  absence  of  specific conferment  of   a  power  in  that regard."" (Emphasis supplied) In the  case on  hand, it  is not  in dispute  that the authority who  issued the  charge-sheet was  the controlling authority.

Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the impugned orders, we are of the view that the order of the High Court, dismissing the Writ Application on the ground of maintainability of the same, cannot be sustained.  It appears that an application under Article 32 of the Constitution was filed before this Court, which came to be registered as W.P. (C) 141 of 2006, which was dismissed as withdrawn.  The order of this Court runs as under: \023The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner seeks leave of the Court to withdraw this Writ Petition.  Permission granted.  The Writ Petition is allowed to be withdrawn and is dismissed as such.\024 5.      After the Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution was withdrawn, a fresh Writ Application was filed in the High Court, which was dismissed on the ground that since the point taken in the Writ Petition was already urged before this Court and the Writ Application under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was withdrawn, there could not be any question to entertain the Writ Application. A Review Application was filed, which was also dismissed by the High Court and the appellants have filed this appeal against the aforesaid two orders. 6.      In our view, the High Court had gone wrong in dismissing the Writ Application on the ground that it was not maintainable after the Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution was withdrawn.  It is now well settled that when a Writ Petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution is dismissed as withdrawn, that would not take away the right of the Writ Petitioner to move a fresh writ application under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Article 226 of the Constitution for the same relief.  That being the position, we have no other alternative but to set aside the impugned order, including the order passed in the Review petition and restore the writ application for decision afresh in accordance with law.  We request the High Court to decide the writ application after giving hearing to the parties and after passing a reasoned and speaking order within four months from the date of supply of a copy of this order to the High Court. 7.      The impugned orders, therefore, are set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.  There will be no order as to costs. 8.

Shri Misra.  who has  appeared for  the respondent, has however, taken a stand that the appeal may not be decided on the basis  of  the  aforesaid  judgment  inasmuch  as  while deciding the  aforesaid case, this Court’s attention was not drawn to  the  Resolution  of  the  State  Government  dated 21.5.1974 on the subject of age of superannuation of workmen appointed in Architectural and Drawing Branches of P.W.D. in which draughtsman  is one  of the  category of  the staff of Architectural Branch,  who is  required to  be  retained  in service till the age of 60 years. 4.   In the  case in  question this Court was called upon to decide the  age of  retirement of a ‘workman’ who as per the second proviso  to Rule  71(a) of  the Orissa  Service  Code shall ordinarily  be retained  in service upto the age of 60 years. In  the Note  appended to  the proviso,  it has  been stated that  ‘a workman’  means a highly skilled, skilled or semi-skilled and  unskilled artisan  employed on  a  monthly rate of pay in any Government establishment. After examining the meaning  of the  word ""artisan""  finding  place  in  the different dictionaries, it was held in paragraph 12 that the object of the Rule appears to bring ""artisan-workman"" on par with Class  IV employees, and he alone is required to retire on the  completion of  60 years of age, but not the gazetted or non-gazetted  Class III Government servants or even Class II or  I, which  would be  the result  if all  artisans were given benefit of retention of service upto 60 years inasmuch http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 as even  a Director of own Planning or Chief Architect could be considered to be an artisan. It was, therefore, held that among others  a draftsman  would not be a workman to get the benefit of retention of service upto the age of 60 years. 5.   Shri Misra has taken pains to submit that the aforesaid Government Resolution  having specifically  stated that  the draftsman would get the benefit of retention of service upto 60 years,  the appeal may not be decided on the basis of the aforementioned judgment,  because if  the attention  of  the Court would  have drawn  to the  Resolution, it  is probable that the  Court would  have taken  different view. We do not agree with  the learned  counsel because  a perusal  of  the Resolution shows  that the  same  owes  its  origin  to  the decision of the Orissa High Court in OJC No.632/69 read with the definition  of the workman in the Note below the proviso to Rule  71 (a).  What is  the purport  of the Note has been explained in  the aforesaid decision of this court. The High Court’s judgment  in the OJC, cannot now be rewarded as good in law.  According to  us,  therefore,  the  fact  that  the attention of  the Court  in Adwait Charan Mohanty’s case was not drawn to the Resolution has no significance. 6.   The appeal,  therefore, has  to be  allowed,  which  we hereby  do,   inasmuch  as  by  the  impugned  judgment  the respondent, who  is a  draftsman, has  been  ordered  to  be retained in  service upto the age of 60 years. He has indeed to retire on completion of age of 58 years. So, the impugned judgment is set aside. 7.

" O R D E R HANSARIA, J. The appeal  raises a  question of  some importance with regard to  the effect  of section 38-B, inserted in the U.P. Imposition of  Ceiling on  Land Holdings  Act, 1960, by U.P. Act No. 20 of 1976, which had come into force on October 10, 1975. 2.   Section 38-B reads as below : ""No finding or decision given before the commencement  of  this  section  in  any proceeding or  on any  issue  (including any order,  decree or  judgment) by  any court, tribunal  or authority in respect of any  matter  governed  by  this  Act, shall   bar   the   re-trial   of   such proceeding or  issue under  this Act, in accordance with  the provisions  of this Act as amended from time to time."" 3.   The need  for finding  out the  effect of the aforesaid section has  arisen because,  on the  proceeding  under  the aforesaid Act being taken up, the Civil Judge, Jalaun, by an order of  May 1,  1975 held  that no  land of  the appellant (respondent No.1  herein) could  be declared  as surplus. On the proceeding  being reinitiated,  the Addl. Sub-Divisional Officer, who is the Prescribed Authority, determined an area of 31.73  acres of  land (in  terms of  irrigated  land)  as surplus. On appeal being preferred, the Civil Judge, Jalaun, modified the order of the Prescribed Authority, as indicated in his  order dated  July 25,  1977. When  a contention  was advanced on  behalf  of  the  appellants  therein  (who  are respondents  herein)   that  the  finding  of  the  previous proceeding operated as res judicata, the learned Civil Judge stated  that   judgment   having   been   delivered   before 10.10.1975, the  same could not operate as res judicata. The respondents approached  the High  Court by filing a petition http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 under Article  226. The view taken by the High Court is that the findings  operate as  res  judicata,  on  the  basis  of pronouncement dated 21st September, 1979 by a Division Bench in Krishan Kumar’s case (Writ Petition No.3073 of 1977). 4.   As section  38-B on  its language  may not  support the stand of  the High  Court, but  keeping in mind the averment made in  the counter-affidavit  of the respondents that more than ten  thousand cases  were decided  by the High Court on the  basis   of  the  view  presently  taken,  it  would  be appropriate to  peruse the  judgment rendered  by  the  High Court in Krishan Kumar’s case, which is not on record. 5.   The counsel  for the  appellant is, therefore, directed to place that judgment on record, and let us know whether it was appealed  against; if  so, what was the result. It would also be  necessary to  know  under  what  circumstances  the second  proceeding   came  to   be  initiated   against  the respondents. A  responsible officer of the State would swear an affidavit  in this  regard. We  allow four weeks time for this purpose.  When the  case shall  be taken  up next,  the records of the Prescribed Authority shall be made available. 6.   Put up for further hearing after four weeks. 7.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.   It  is  contended for the appellants that  as  per  the directions,  issued by the High Court in Writ  Petition  No. 1173 of 1962, dated 4-3-1965, the High Court had struck down the  rules  holding  that there cannot  be  any  distinction between the Talatis and Village Accountants.  They cannot be clubbed  together and they constitute  different  categories and that, therefore, they are entitled to separate scales of pay.   When  they claimed the scale of pay on the  basis  of revised  pay scales at Rs 90-200 instead of Rs  80-145,  the Tribunal  has  committed illegality in not  considering  the distinction  and  that  therefore, the  appellants  are  not entitled to the benefit of the payment of scale of pay of Rs 90-200 as per 1970 Rules w.e.f. 1-1-1970. 3.   It would appear that the Government made a  distinction between  Talatis and Village Accountants who possessed  SSLC qualification  and those who are non-SSLC  candidates.   For the candidates who are having SSLC qualification, pay  scale of  Rs  90-200  has  been  provided  for.   Admittedly,  the appellants  are  not in that category as they  are  non-SSLC candidates.  The Government, therefore, thought it expedient to  make  a distinction between  qualified  and  unqualified persons  and prescribed different scales of pay.  Hence,  we do  not find any invidious discrimination made  between  the two categories to club together and grant them same scale of pay  of  Rs  90-200.  However,  since  the  appellants  have already  been paid the scale of pay of Rs 90-200 while  they were in service and are retired now, it would be appropriate that  the  Government may not recover from them  the  salary which they had already received though they are not eligible to the scale of pay of Rs 90-200. 4.

" JUDGMENT SEMA, J. The appellant at the relevant time was holding the post of Additional District Judge (Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service). By an order dated 9.11.2000, he was compulsorily retired from service. He has assailed the order of compulsorily before the High Court. The High Court of Rajasthan dismissed the Writ Petition after perusing the entire records placed before it. The appellant was compulsorily retired on the basis of Review Committee report submitted by four Senior Hon’ble Judges of the High Court which was approved by the Full Court of the High Court. We have been taken through the entire judgment of the High Court. The High Court, on perusal of the record produced before it, found that in the year 1983, the appellant was not assessed as good officer and his integrity was doubtful. In 1984 he was reported to be corrupt officer. The High Court was also of the view that when the appellant has been granted selection grade, the adverse entries were not brought to the notice of the authority. The High Court also noted that the Review Committee consisting of four Senior Hon’ble Judges of the High Court noticed that the performance of the appellant was poor and he was advised to improve his judgment writing, In 1974 there was a remark that he should be watched and quality of case work was found unsatisfactory. The remarks were also communicated to the appellant. In 1977 there was also an entry that he should improve the quality of his judgments. In 1983 he was not assessed as good officer and his integrity was found doubtful. His representation against adverse entry was reflected. In 1993 there was an entry in his ACR that he failed to inspire the confidence in subordinate staff and lawyers and his disposal was also found low. The Review Committee also noted that he has been superseded without being considered for promotion in 1983. The departmental enquiry under Rule 16 of the Rajasthan Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) rules, 1958 where finding against the appellant of being negligent and grossly careless in discharging his judicial duties, have been recorded, which ended in minor penalty of censure imposed on him and he was further warned to remain careful and cautious while discharging his judicial functions. On the basis of overall perusal of the ACR and overall assessment of service record of the appellant, the Review Committee consisting of four Senior Judges found that continuance of officer would be liability to the Department and adverse to the public interest and recommended that he should be compulsorily retired. It is noticed that the recommendations of the Review Committee was accepted by the Full Court in a meeting held on 8th November, 2000. It is really a case of chopping of the dead wood. That apart, either before the High Court or before this Court, the appellant never raised and allegation of mala fide nor the said order has been passed without application of mind. In fact, considering the aforesaid http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 facts and circumstances the appointing authority has come to the conclusion that the appellant’s continuance in the service will be a liability to the public interest and passed the order after subjective satisfaction of the matter on the basis of the record placed before the authority. Learned senior counsel cited the decisions rendered in 1. [1992] 2 SCC 299 (Bhaikuntha Nath Das and Anr. v. Chief District Medical Officer Braipada and Anr.,) 2. [2001] 3 SCC 341 (State of Gujarat v.

The ratio of the decision cited quoted by the learned senior counsel for the appellant, are not applicable in the facts of this case.

In the year 2002 she filed an application for grant of maintenance in terms of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Magistrate allowed the said application directing grant of maintenance @ Rs. 1,000/- per month. Respondent filed a revision application thereagainst. The Revisional Court set aside the said order opining as under: -1- ""....that helps the revisionist wherein it has been laid down that if the husband does not disregard the wife nor does he denies to maintain her and despite three letters calling her to join matrimonial home, if the wife refuses to live with her husband and if after enough time the husband marries second time, the wife is not entitled for maintenance u/s 125 Cr.P.C. if Rs. 150 demanded as maintenance for the son one is not entitled for Rs. 200 per month maintenance. In this regard Kamlabai Vs.Gajanand 1984 MPWN 170 is also considerable."" It was concluded: "" From the finding on issue No.1 & 2 it is apparent that the applicant cannot be considered eligible to seek maintenance. Therefore, the maintenance as granted by the court below cannot be considered appropriate. For these reasons the Revision Petition is acceptable.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We  have   heard  the   counsel  on   both  sides.  The Government,  exercising  its  power  under  the  proviso  to Article 309  of the  Constitution, issued U.P. Non-Technical (Class  II)   Services   (Reservation   of   Vacancies   for Demobilised Officers)  Rules,  1973.  The  same  Rules  were reissued  in  1980.  These  Rules  would  be  applicable  to officers  of  Short  Commissioned  or  Commissioned  Officer recruited to  the army  between November  1, 1962 to January 10, 1968;  and on  December 3, 1971 and released at any time thereafter. Admittedly,  the appellant  was commissioned  on September 22,  1974 and  was released  on November 30, 1979. Advertisement was  made for recruitment of Deputy Collectors on May  2, 1979.  The appellant  had  applied  for  and  was selected as  a Deputy  Collector. He  sought  for  seniority w.e.f. September  22, 1974 in terms of Rule 5 of 1980 Rules. Since it  was not  given, he  filed W.P. No. 2469/89 and the High Court of Allahabad dismissed the writ petition on April 25, 1994. Thus, this appeal by special leave. It is  not in  dispute that  the Rules  have been given retrospective  effect   and,  therefore,  the  appellant  is entitled to the benefit of seniority in accordance with Rule 5 of  1980 Rules.  It was  contended in  the High Court that since 1973  Rules were  withdrawn w.e.f. August 6, 1978, the appellant is  not  entitled  to  the  benefit  when  he  was recruited in  the year  1979. That appears to be obviously a mistaken stand  taken by  the Government,  since 1980  Rules have  been   given  retrospective  effect  w.e.f.  6.8.1978. Thereby even  1973 Rules  must be  deemed to be in operation till 1980  Rules were  framed afresh. As per the memorandum, Ann.II, which is now made part of the record, the Government have clarified  that all  benefits, except  the reservation, were withdrawn  by the  notification issued w.e.f. August 6, 1978. In  other words,  even the  right of  reservation  was maintained during interregnum. Accordingly, the appellant is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 entitled to the seniority as per 1980 Rules.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 26402-404 of 2005) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench, dismissing the review petition filed by the appellant. Background facts in  a nutshell are as follows: Appellant had claimed benefit available under the compounding method in payment of entertainment duty under the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Entertainment Duties (Advertisement Tax) Act, 1936 (in short the ’Act’).  Prayer was sought for to accord the benefit with effect from 1.4.1996 in place of 1.1.1997 as was granted.  It was pleaded that though the benefit was granted by order dated 20.12.1996 rightly, it was not proper to confine it for the period from 1.1.1997 to 31.3.1997 instead of from 1.4.1996 to 31.3.1997.  The writ petition was dismissed on the ground that no effective relief can be granted to the writ petitioner in 2003-04 in respect of a dispute which related to the year 1996-97. The order dated 7.1.2004 passed in writ petition No.67/97 was assailed by filing a Letters Patent Appeal.  According to the appellant, the filing of the LPA was necessitated because the writ petitioner had sought permission of the Court to place reliance on the decision rendered in another Writ Petition (MP No. 3398 of 1992) dated 21.11.2000. By order dated 26.2.2002,  learned Single Judge directed that the matter shall be listed, so it can be taken note of at the time of final hearing.  Contrary to the order, learned Single Judge did not take note of the order passed in a similar case.  The Letters Patent Appeal was disposed of inter alia with the following observations: ""Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after perusal of the record, we are of the opinion that if according to the appellant, the question posed in the appellant’s writ petition stood answered by a judgment pronounced by another Single Judge and also keeping in mind that the said judgment has neither been http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 referred to nor considered, then it would be a fit case where appellant should apply for review of the said order so as to specifically bring it to the notice of the learned Single Judge and then to advance arguments."" Accordingly, the review petition was filed on 16.8.2004 which was numbered as MCC No. 461 of 2004.  The same was dismissed by the impugned order holding that review was not permissible.  It was noted that in any event the decision on which reliance was placed by the appellant was not in the nature of a binding precedent. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the LPA filed was not decided, because the Division Bench felt that the same can be agitated in a review petition.  Contrary to what was stated by the Division Bench, learned Single Judge held that review petition was not maintainable.  Consequentially, the appellant was left without a remedy. Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that the learned Single Judge has rightly held that the review petition was not maintainable. We find substance in the plea of learned counsel for the appellant that it was being left without a remedy. The Division Bench declined to interfere in the matter holding that the grievance could be looked into in a review petition.  Learned Single Judge observed that the review petition was not maintainable. In the peculiar circumstances, we set aside the order of the learned Single Judge.  It would be appropriate for the Division Bench to hear the LPA No. 106 of 2004.  The same shall be heard and disposed of on merits in accordance with law.

All  the  three  accused filed Criminal  Appeal  No.396  of  1980  in  the  High  Court  of Judicature at  Allahabad.    The  High  Court  held that the accused had acted in exercise of  ""their  right  of  private defence  but  had  exceeded  the  same and, therefore, their conviction under Section 302 was not proper.  It, therefore, partly allowed the appeal by setting aside their  conviction under  Section 304, IPC and by convicting them under Section 304, Part I, IPC, and sentenced them to suffer 7 years’ R.l. Out of the three convicted, accused only the  appellant  has filed an appeal challenging his and conviction under Section 304, Part I, IPC, and also the order of sentence. What  is  urged  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant  is  that  the  conviction  of the appellant under Section 304, Part I, IPC, is not sustainable as there is  no evidence  to  show  that  he  had  inflicted any blow on the deceased.  He submitted that the evidence which was  led  by the  prosecution  was of general nature as Munshi Lal - PW-1 and Raja Ram- PW -2 - have not specifically stated that  the appellant  had  given  any  particular  blow with a stick to deceased Ram Saran. In  this  case,  the  accused  had  also led defence evidence to prove that accused Ramanand  had  also  received injuries during  the  same incident.  After appreciating the evidence of the prosecution witnesses  and  considering  the circumstance  that  the  accused  had also received injuries which had remained unexplained the High Court  came  to  the conclusion  that  the  prosecution  version  was not such as could be accepted in toto.  It also took note  of  the  fact that  independent  witnesses,  though  available,  were  not examined by the prosecution.  It also held that the  accused had a  right  of  private  defence.   It held that the three convicted accused had exceeded the right of private  defence but  we  do not find any evidence to show that the appellant had given, fatal blow or any blow which was likely to  cause http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the death of  Ram.   Saran.  In absence of such evidence the appellant could have been convicted only under  Section  325 and not under Section 304 Part I IPC.  We, therefore, partly allow  this appeal and alter the conviction of the appellant from that under Section 304, Part I, IPC to Section 325 IPC.

" O R D E R Punjab Water  Supply and  Sewage Board, Chandigarh (the Board)  filed  a  complaint  before  the  Consumer  Disputes Redressal Commission,  U.T. Chandigarh  (Commission) against M/s. Udaipur  Cement Works,  Udaipur, Rajasthan  (the cement works), alleging,  inter alia,  deficiency in service in the supply of  cement for  which confirmed orders were placed by the Board.  The Commission allowed the complaint and awarded 12% interest  to the  Board for  the period during which the amount of  deposit  remained  with  the  cement  works.  The National  Consumer   Disputes  Redressal   Commission   (the National Commission)  by the  order dated September 27, 1994 reversed the  order of  the  Commission  and  dismissed  the complaint of  the Board. This appeal by way of special leave is against the order of the National Commission. The  Commission   noticed  the  admitted  facts,  which emerged from  the pleadings of the parties, in the following words: ""Certain undisputed facts emerge in this case. The salient ones are that the complainant placed an order for the supply of cement with the respondent firm and  for this purpose, an amount of Rs.23,62,900/- was remitted to the respondent firm and by means of three o Bank Drafts. According to the order as confirmed, 2500 M.T. Cement had to be supplied on or before 7.3.1988. There is also no  controversy about the fact that the goods  in question were delivered to the complainant in November, 1990 and that too at the higher rate and not at the original rate as agreed to at the time of   placing the order. In the wake of these undisputed facts, the points http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 raised in defence on behalf of the respondent firm may be considered."" The National  Commission  allowed  the  appeal  of  the cement works  and set aside the order of the Commission by a short order which is reproduced hereunder: ""In our opinion the counsel appearing for the Appellant is well founded in his submission that  there was no arrangment of hiring  of service at all between the parties in this case since the transaction is  one of sale and purchase simplicitor namely the sale and purchase of a  specified quantity of cement which was to be supplied by the Appellant herein to the Respondent. In these cumstances no  question of deficiency in ervice can arise so as to entitle the complainant to invoke the jurisdiction of the  Consumer Forum when there was no case at all of any defect in the goods supplied. Unfortunately,  this important aspect of  the case was lost sight of by the State Commission and it proceeded to grant relief to the Complainant on the ground that delay in the supply of cement constituted deficiency in service. We  hold that the said Order of the State  Commission is clearly illegal and without jurisdiction and is hereby set aside. The Complainant will be at liberty to pursue whatever other remedies are open to him in law."" We do  not appreciate  the blanket  observation of  the National Commission to the effect that where the transaction is one  of sale  and purchase  simplicitor ""no  question  of deficiency in  service  can  arise  so  as  to  entitle  the complainant to invoke the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum when there  was no  case at  all of  any defect in the goods supplied"". The  impugned order of the National Commission is rather mechanical.  Learned counsel  for  the  parties  have invited our  attention to  Section 2 (c), (d), (f), (g), (o) and various other provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (the Act). The National Commission, in our view, should have appreciated  the pleadings  of the parties in the light of various provisions of the Act.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the   Central Administrative  Tribunal,  Allahabad  made  on March 2, 1995 in O.A. No.617 of 1990. The admitted  position is that while the respondent was working as  a Shunter  in 1980  he had  filed a  civil  suit bearing  No.329/83  in  the  court  of  Additional  District Munsif,  Allahabad  for  declaration  that  the  defendants, their agents  and  servants  be  directed  to  consider  his promotion to  the category of Driver ‘C’ in the pay-scale of Rs. 330-560 from December 10,1980 when his immediate juniors were promoted to that category of employees. The decree came to be passed by the trial Court on March 24, 1984.On appeal, the Additional District Judge Allahabad confirmed it on July 18, 1985. In compliance thereof, the respondent was promoted as Driver  ‘C’ on  June 10, 1986. Thereafter, the respondent filed the  application under  Section 15  of the  Payment of Wages Act on July 8, 1986. The prescribed Authority directed by order  dated December  7, 1988 payment of back-wages in a sum of Rs.30,220/- The Union of India filed an appeal before the  Additional   District  judge   which   was   dismissed. Thereafter, the  O.A. was  filed in  Central  Administrative Tribunal which has been dismissed by the impugned order When the matter  had come  Up for  hearing notice  was   directed subject to  the appellant’s  depositing a  sum of Rs.5,000/- towards  the  legal  expenses  incurred  by  the  respondent Pursuant  thereto the amount came to be deposited. It is  contended by  Mr Dhruv Mehta learned counsel for the respondent,  that since the prescribed Authority and the appellate Authority  under the  Payment of Wages act are not the authorities  subordinate to the Administration Tribunal, the  O.A.   is  not  maintainable.  We  find  force  in  the contention. But,  nonetheless, the  material  question  that arises for consideration is  whether the authority under the Payment of  Wages Act  has the jurisdiction under Section 15 of the  Act to  compute  back  wages  on  promotion  of  the respondent as  Driver ‘C’.  Admittedly, when  the respondent http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 had the  relief in  the  suit  by  way  of  declaration  for promotion and  the declaration  having been given and become final there  in the respondent had not sought any relief for payment of back-wages. Consequently, by operation of Order 2 Rule 2  of the  Code of  Civil Procedure  the respondent  is debarred to  claim the  relief of  back-wages. The authority under the  Payment of  Wages Act, therefore, has no inherent jurisdiction in  the matter   to  entertain  the  claim  for payment of back-wages and for grant of the order.

Five  persons  had  applied  for  the recruitment. The appellant was selected and was appointed as the Police  Patil. On challenge being made by the respondent No.1  before  the  Tribunal,  the  Tribunal  set  aside  the appointment order  of the  appellant.

Therefore, the Tribunal set aside the appointment of the appellant and directed to appoint the respondent. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Mr. Khanwilkar,  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant, contended that  even assuming  that prescription  of 50%  of marks for  viva-voce is invalid the appropriate course would have been  that a direction was given to the respondent Nos. 2 and  3 to  prescribe lesser marks for viva-voce and higher marks for  written  examination  and  to  direct  conducting examinations of  the candidates  who had  applied for afresh and considering  the cases  of the  candidates according  to law.

" O R D E R B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J. I agree  respectfully with  the opinion  prepared by my learned brother K.S. Paripooran, J. Looking  at  the  provisions  of  the  Sick  Industrial Companies (Special  Provisions) Act,  1985 [ the Act], I was wondering how  out of  tune the  Act  has  become  with  the economic policies  being pursued  now in this country. Since 1991-92, we  are launched  upon,  what  is    being  called, liberalisation of  our economy.  We have given up the policy of protecting  our industries against foreign competition on the ground  that it  has given  rise to  an inefficient  and outdated industrial  system in  our country.  Our industries are suddenly  being asked to compete with foreign companies, many of whom being giant multi-nationals have vast resources at their  disposal. They  are merrily  gobbling up  our poor native companies. Many local industries, unable to stand the said competition  are joining the foreign giants in one form of venture  or other.  Several hundreds  of small-scale  and medium scale  units in  telecom sector,  for  example,  have suffered  enormously   because  of   our  love  for  foreign companies and  their capital.  The state  of several  public sector companies  is no better. I am not saying that we have totally  embraced,   what  may   be  called  ""Reaganism""  or ""Thatcherism"". The  fact, however,  remains that  it  is  no longer thought  advisable  to  keep  alive  inefficient  and uneconomic industries  by injecting  public funds  or in the name of safeguarding the employment of the workers. And here is this  Act, a  product of the era of protectionism seeking to keep  alive ""sick"" companies by pumping in funds - mostly public funds  - and by providing various concessions. In the process, nobody enquires why a particular industrial company has become  sick, viz.,  whether it  is an  induced  one  or whether it  is on  account of  factors beyond their control. The object  of the  Act is undoubtedly laudatory but it must also  provide   for  appropriate   measures  against  person responsible where  it is  found that  sickness is  caused by factors other  than circumstances  beyond the control of the management.  It   is  also   a  well-known   fact  that  the proceedings before  the Board  of Industrial  and  Financial http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Reconstruction take  a long  time to  conclude and  all  the while the protective umbrella of Section 22 is held over the company which  has reported  sick. We have come across cases where  unfair  advantage  is  sought  to  be  taken  of  the provisions of  Section 22  by certain industrial companies - and the  wide language  employed in the section is providing them a  cover. We are sure section 22 was not meant to breed dishonesty nor  can it be so operated as to encourage unfair practices. The  ultimate prejudice  to public  monies should not be  overlooked in  the process  of promoting  industrial progress. We  are quite  sure that  the Government  is fully alive to  the situation  and are  equally certain  that they must be  thinking of  necessary modifications  in  the  Act. These few  observations are  meant merely to record the need for changes in the Act.","Since 1991-92, we have given up the policy of protecting  our industries against foreign competition.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appellant  herein is the window of Late Bipin Kumar Rai who was a temporary Railway servant in this manner : He, initially, was  taken in  the  Railway  Establishment  as  a casual worker;  and w.e.f. 27.4.83 he acquired the status of a ‘substitute’.  According to  the definition  given in Rule 2315 of  the terms and conditions applicable to ‘substitute’ in temporary service, they are persons engaged in the Indian Railway  Establishments   on  regular   scales  of  pay  and allowances  applicable  to  posts  against  which  they  are employed. These  posts may  fall  vacant  on  account  of  a railway servant being on leave or due to non-availability of permanent or  temporary railway servants and which cannot be kept vacant. The deceased kept working as a ‘substitute’ till 5.1.87 when he  died. But,  before his  demise, he  came to acquire certain rights  and privileges  under Rule 2318 of the Rules applicable to Railway Establishments. The said rule provides that substitutes  shall  be  afforded  all  the  rights  and privileges  as   may  be  admissible  to  temporary  railway servants, from  time to  time, on  completion of  6  months’ continuous service.  Indubitably, the  deceased  had  worked beyond 6  months and  that too continuously. Having become a temporary servant  in this  manner, he  became  entitled  to family pension  under sub-rule 3(b) of Rule 2311; whereunder it is  provided that the widow/minor children of a temporary Railway servant,  who dies  while in service after a service of not  less than  1 year  continuous  (qualifying)  service shall be  eligible for a family pension under the provisions of para 801 of the Manual of Railway Pension Rules. Further, in their  case the  amount of death gratuity admissible will be reduced  by an  amount equal  to the employee’s 2 months’ pay on  which the death gratuity is determined. The Railways have paid to the appellant gratuity under this sub-rule, but have denied  to her the family pension. Her claim before the C  A   T,  Patna  Bench,  Patna,  was  dismissed  which  has culminated into this appeal. On the  acquisition of  temporary status derived in the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 manner stated  above, it  is difficult to sustain the orders of the  Tribunal and to deny family pension to the widow and children of the deceased. See in this connection for support L Robert D’Souza Vs. Ex. Engineer, Southern Railway and Anr. (1982 1  SCC 645  and U.O.I. and Ors Vs. Basant Lal and Ors. (JT 1992  (2) SC  459). We  have put  the proposition to the learned counsel  appearing for the Railways but he is unable to support  the orders  of the  Tribunal; overlooking  as it does the chain in consequence, making the deceased acquire a temporary status  and on  his demise  his widow and children acquiring the right to claim family pension. We, thus,  allow this  appeal; set  aside the  impugned orders of the Tribunal and allow the claim to family pension as projected by the appellant. We also direct the railway to work out  the pension  due within  2 months  from today  and deliver the  pension as  also the  arrears to  the appellant within 15  days thereafter,  if not  earlier  and  also  pay interest at  the rate  of 12% per annum from the date it was due till payment.

In this appeal by special leave the order of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Indore Bench dated 9th January, 2002 in Criminal Appeal No.1213/2001 has been impugned.

" WITH CIVIL  APPEAL NOS. 1206-09, 2253 AND 2254-55 OF 1991 O R D E R Notification  under   Section  4   (1)  of   the   Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894) (for short, the ’Act’) was published on  September 25,  1979 acquiring  large tracks of land  for   urbanization  within  the  municipal  limits  of Panipat. The  Land Acquisition  Officer in  his award  dated April 7, 1981 determined the compensation at the rate of Rs- 24,960/- per  acre for  Block I and Rs.19,992/- per acre for Block  II.  On  reference,  the  Additional  District  Judge enhanced the  compensation by  his award  and  decree  dated January 24,  1984 to Rs.18/- per sq.yd. On further appeal by the State  as well as the claimants, the High Court enhanced the  compensation  to  Rs.21.25/-  per  sq.yd.  without  any deductions for  developmental charges.  The High  Court  has also granted  additional amount under Section 23 (1A) of the Act. Thus, these appeals by special leave. Shri Sehgal,  learned senior counsel for the appellants contended that  the notification relied upon by the District Judge relates  to third  acquisition dated  October 10, 1978 while the  acquisition in the case is of September 25, 1979. Therefore, the learned Judge ought to have granted escalated charges rather  than what  was granted in the earlier cases. We find  no force in the contention. In fact, the Additional District Judge  relying upon  small piece  of land which did not  find   favour  with   the  High   Court,  enhanced  the compensation.  The   High  Court  also  on  the  comparative evaluation and  considering the  evidence adduced before the reference Court,  determined the compensation at she rate of Rs. 21.25  per sq.yd.  It  is  settled  law  that  when  the compensation is  determined on  yardage  basis  for  housing development and the lands are to be developed, the direction to deduct 1/3rd towards the development charges, is required to be  given.

" ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.   The appellant-society has been running a school at 11th Cross  West Park Road, Malleswaram in Bangalore  City.   The said school has been in existence for about 22 years and was shifted in 1976 to the present premises.  The school has got about  1500  students.  Adjacent to the school there  is  an open  land  about 300 ft. x 75 ft.  It is the claim  of  the appellant  that they have applied for allotment of  land  of 100 ft. x 75 ft. to use it as a playground for the  children as there is no open land for playground.  It is their  claim that the municipal corporation had not allotted the land and that  therefore they moved a petition.  Their  petition  has been dismissed by the corporation without considering  their request.   When the matter has gone to the High Court  under Article 226, initially the learned Single Judge remitted the matter  for  reconsideration  by  the  corporation,  but  on appeal, in the impugned judgment in Writ Appeal No. 2407  of 1990, the Division Bench by order dated 25-3-1992 interfered with and dismissed the writ petition of the appellant.  Thus this appeal, by special leave. 3.   It  is  not  in dispute that  the  appellant  has  been running  the school for about 22 years and that there is  no independent  land  for use as a playground by  the  students around   1500.    Admittedly,  Respondent   1,   Malleswaram Sangeetha  Sabha  obtained  lease  of  the  land  from   the municipal corporation to an extent of 100 ft. x 75 ft. which is adjacent to the school.  The appellant claimed  allotment of  same land near about the school.  The High  Court  found that the appellant had + Arising out of SLP (C) No. 15992 of 1992 27 not made any specific claim to allot that particular land, a vague  reference was made to allot any land adjacent to  the school  and that therefore the appellant cannot claim as  of right for any allotment.  In view of the fact that from 1976 the school is being run in the present premises and adjacent to  this the land allotted to the 1st respondent  admittedly was vacant at that time.  Reasonably when the school claimed for  allotment, the allotment may be adjacent to the  school http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 so  that  the land could be used by the  children  as  their playground without any difficulty.  Obviously the  municipal corporation  was  to allot the vacant land adjacent  to  the school instead, it had granted lease to the 1st  respondent. Under those circumstances we find it is just and proper that the  municipal  corporation should allot the  adjacent  land allotted to the 1st respondent to the appellant’s school for using it as a playground.  It is also pointed out that after this  land,  there appears to be another vacant land  of  an extent  of 200 ft. x 75 ft. as stated in  the  Plan-Annexure ’E’ filed in this Court as part of the documents and if that land  is  vacant municipal corporation  would  consider  the allotment  of  100  ft. x 75 ft. in that  land  to  the  1st respondent for using it for construction of the building for musical concert.  In case of any difficulty any other vacant land  in that area may be considered for allotment on  lease to the first respondent. 4.   Under  these circumstances the order of the High  Court is set aside and there shall be a direction to the municipal corporation to allot the land of 100 ft. x 75 ft. which  was allotted immediately to the 1st respondent to the appellant- society and within a period of three months from the date of the  receipt of the order an equal portion may  be  allotted near  about  the  place  to the  1st  respondent  as  stated earlier. 5.   The appeal is allowed but in the circumstances  without costs. 28","The appellant-society has been running a school at 11th Cross  West Park Road, Malleswaram in Bangalore City.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Patna  High Court,  made on December 10,1984 in CWJC No. 5491/84 dismissing the writ petition in limine. The  admitted   facts  are  that  Sukhdeo  Raj  is  the predecessor in  interest of  respondents.  Gulabo  Devi  and others had purchased one katha of land towards the east land of the  appellants from  Sukhdeo Rai by a sale deed executed on December  31,1979  Which  was    got  registered  on  for February 8,1980.

The Tribunal help in favour  of the  appellant respondent The Collector in the proceedings  dated   August  11,   1984  held   against  the appellants. The  High Court  has dismissed the writ petition in limine  as stated  earlier. The  question, therefore  is: Whether the view of the collector is correct in law?

Leave granted. Heard leaned counsel for the parties. The only  ground on  which the  High Court  allowed the writ petition  filed  by  the  respondents  challenging  the attempt to  acquire their  lands in plot No. 2611 of village Kashai  was   that  the  said  plot  was  not  notified  for acquisition and,  therefore, it  was not  open to  the State Government to deprive the appellants of the said lands or to interfere with  their possession.  It  is  true  that  while issuing notification  under Section 4 on  2.6.1978 the State Government committed  a mistake  in stating  the name of the village in  which the  said plot  is situated.  In the  said notification it  was described  as a  plot of village Bankat whereas really  the said plot is situated in village Kashai. Realizing this  mistake the  State Government  had issued  a corrigendum dated  27.11.1978 which  was published  in  U.P. gazette on  16.12.1978 and  thereby  the  said  mistake  was corrected by  stating that  what was  sought to  be acquired under Section  4 notification was 0.91 acres of land of plot No. 2611 of village kashai. It was because of the negligence of the  State Government  that the said fact was not brought to the  notice of  the High  Court. However, in view of this corrigendum it  cannot be  disputed that  0.91 acres of land out of  the said  plot was  notified for  acquisition by the State Government.  The declaration  made under Section 6 was also required to be read accordingly. It was, therefore, not proper for  the High  Court to  declare that no part of plot No. 2611  of village Kashai was notified for acquisition and to grant  an injunction  restraining the  State from  taking http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 over possession  of the  respondents’ lands.

" JUDGMENT 2004(2) SCR 352 The Order of the Court was delivered The appellant herein is incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and started its commercial production in the year 1982. It appears that subsequently it became sick. It is alleged that the appellant-Company could not run because of non-supply of electrical energy by the respondents herein. It is under such circumstances, the appellant herein filed a suit for damages against respondents for the damage suffered during the period commencing from 28th March, 1983 to 16th October, 1992. The said suit was filed sometime in March, 1993 on the Original Side of the Madras High Court. In July. 1998, the appellant herein filed an interlocutory application for amendment of the plaint. By the said application for amendment, the appellant sought to enhance its claim for damages. The learned Single Judge of the High Court allowed the amendment, as prayed for. The respondents herein went in appeal before the Letters Patent Bench before the High Court and the Bench set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and allowed the appeal. It is against the said order and judgment, the appellant is in appeal before us. Shri T.L.V. Iyer, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellant, urged that the view taken by the High Court in rejecting the amendment of the appellant was erroneous. The law as regards permitting amendment to the plaint, is well settled. In L.J. Leach and Co. Ltd and Anr. v. Messrs Jardine Skinner and Co., AIR (1957) SC 357 = [1957] SCR 438, it was held that the Court as a rule decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on the date of the application. But that is a factor to be taken into account in exercise of the discretion as to whether amendment should be ordered and does not affect the power of the Court to order it. It is not disputed that the appellate court has a co-extensive power of the trial court. We find that the discretion exercise by the High Court in rejecting the plaint was in conformity with law. For the aforesaid reason, we do not find any merit in the appeal. It fails and is, accordingly, dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.",The appellant herein is incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and started its commercial production in the year 1982.

" J U D G M E N T SANTOSH HEGDE,J. The appellant before us challenged by way of a  writ petition order an order dated 27.1.1993 directing re-trial by a fresh General Security Force Court. This order came to be made by the respondents while the petitioner was being tried by the fresh General Security Force Court for certain misconduct alleged against him and by the said order exercising the authority vested under Section 71(3) of the Border Security Forces Act,   the Inspector General (H.Qs.) dissolved the said court on the ground that the functioning of the said court had become inexpedient for reasons arising out of the conduct of the members and Law Officer constituting the said court. By the said order, he also directed the constitution of a fresh court. The allegation of the appellant before the High Court was that the proceedings before the General Security Forces Court had almost come to an end and a re-trial would prejudice his case,  apart from the fact that it would amount to double jeopardy. The High Court dismissed the said writ petition holding that the authorities had the power to dissolve the court and directed a fresh trial. It was also noticed that the dissolution took place primarily on the complaint made by the appellant himself alleging that the Law Officer was being very unfair to the appellant. In such situation, the High Court came to the conclusion that there was no error in the impugned order. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. We also notice that the petitioner himself had alleged in para 27 of the writ petition that the trial that was being held was unfair as the law officer and the prosecutor were determined to deny him a fair trial and were endevouring to get him convicted by unfair means. Therefore, it is crystal clear that it is at the instance of the appellant himself the respondent authorities took steps to dissolve the court and constitute a fresh court to protect the interest of the appellant. In such situation, we cannot permit the appellant to contend that any prejudice will be caused to him by such consequential reconstitution of the court. That apart, we notice that the respondents were well within their authority under Section 71(4) of the Border Security Force Act to issue the impugned order. The question of double jeopardy also does not arise because the petitioner was not either convicted or acquitted of the charges against him in the first trial. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 For the reasons stated above, this appeal fails and the same is dismissed.",The High Court dismissed the said writ petition holding that the authorities had the power to dissolve the court and directed a fresh trial.

Aggrieved by his conviction the appellant  preferred an appeal  before  the  High Court of Punjab & Haryana.  The High Court on reappreciation of the evidence agreed with the finding that the occurrence  took  place  in  the  house  of Shugan Lal and that presence of both the eye witnesses could not  be  disputed  in  the house when the incident had taken place.  It held that their evidence was  quite  reliable  as regards the part played by the appellant and the trial court was right  in accepting the same.  It, therefore, upheld the conviction of the appellant under Sections 307  &  452  IPC. The  appellant  has,  therefore,  filed  this appeal in this Court after obtaining special leave. After going through the judgments of both the courts below, we find that the evidence of both the witnesses  have been correctly appreciated and it has been rightly held that the  appellant  had opened the attack and fired a shot which had hit Raja Ram and caused  injuries  to  him.  We  see  no reason  to  differ  from  the  findings recorded by the High Court and therefore, this appeal is dismissed. The  appellant  was  released  on  bail  during  the pendency of  this  appeal.    He  is  directed  to surrender immediately to carve out the remaining sentence.",The appellant was tried with 7 other accused for the offences punishable under Sections 307 and 452 of the Indian Penal Code.

" ORDER 1.   Special leave granted. 2.   We are surprised, not a little, that the High Court  of Calcutta should have exercised jurisdiction in a case  where it  had  absolutely  no  jurisdiction.   The  contracts   in question were executed at Aligarh, the construction work was to  be carried out at Aligarh,, even the contracts  provided that  in the event of dispute the Aligarh Court  alone  will have jurisdiction.  The arbitrator was from Aligarh and  was to  function  there.  Merely because the  respondent  was  a Calcutta-based  firm,  the High Court of Calcutta  seems  to have exercised jurisdiction where it had none by adopting  a queer  line  of reasoning.  We are constrained to  say  that this is a case of abuse of Jurisdiction and we feel that the respondent  deliberately  moved  the  Calcutta  High   Court ignoring  the fact that no part of the cause of  action  had arisen  within the jurisdiction of that Court.   It  clearly shows  that the litigation filed in the Calcutta High  Court was thoroughly unsustainable. 3.In  the  result we allow these appeals, set  aside  the impugned  orders  of  the High Court  and  direct  that  the proceedings initiated in the High Court of Calcutta shall be returned to the respondent for presentation in proper court.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the judgment and order  of the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench made on February  29, 1996  in C.A.  No . 864/94. Admittedly, the petitioner is  lessee  winnover  in  respect  of  the  miner mineral viz. Sand Stone at Banthali, District Tonk. Since he had not  submitted  proper  returns  as  per  the  Rajasthan Mineral Concession  Rules, 1986 (for short, the ’Rules), the Assessing Authority made best judgment assessment under Rule 38(3) of  the Rules.  When it was challenged, the High Court upheld the  same. It  has been found that the assessment and determination of  the royalty due from an asessee during the assessment made  by the Assessing Authority after the return in respect  of that  year was  filed by  the  petitioner  as required under  terms  and  conditions  of  the  lease.  The petitioner was asked to produce the evidence; on his failure to do  so, a  random check  was conducted  by the  Assessing Authority on  December 24, 1985 and it was found that one of the trucks  going to  Kota contained approximately 12 metric tonnes of  minerals. On the basis of the said weighment  and in the absence of any slips of the actual weighment  carried in the  vehicle,  the  Assessing  Authority  came  to    the conclusion and made the assessment in terms of the  circular issued by the Government on October 17,1987. Sri Mahabir  Singh, learned  counsel appearing  for the petitioner, contended  that the  circular cannot run counter to Rules.  In the  Rules, assessment  has to  be made as per Rule  38  readwith  Rule  18(1)(b)  and    Schedule  I.  The assessment of  more than  100% cannot  be  assessed  by  the authority. We find no force in the contention. It is  true that  the Schedule regulates the payment at the rates  of the  royalty required to be paid. The circular indicates  only   uniform  policy   in  the   best  judsment assessment. It  is provided in clause 2(a) that the minerals from the  mines carried  for local  use and the roads or the significant ways are not bitumens, the minimum weight should be assessed at 150% of similar vehicles carrying the maximum http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 safe weight.  Normally, the  assessing  officials  can  make assessment on the base of the circular for more weight under the power  vested in them. As it would indicate, it does not prescribe rate of payment of the royalty, but prescribes the mode of  assessment of  the total  quantum of  the  minerals carried by  the licensee under the Rules; but they failed to produce slips  of the actual weighment from the mouth of the mines. On  his failure  to do  so, an  opportunity has  been given; the  weighment check was made at random. On the basis thereof, he  assessed 150% as indicated in the circular. The method can  be adopted  only when  the  person  has  avoided payment of  the royalty  and avoidance  of correct  and true weighment of  the minerals  winover and  carried away by the licensee. Under  these circumstances,  we do  not think that the circular runs counter to the statutory rules. It is true that the  penalty by  way of punishment has been provided in the Rules  for contravention.  The assessment  is  different from  the  prosecution  for  contravention.  In  making  the assessment, in  particular when  best judgment assessment is sought to  be made,  uniform instructions have been given in the above  Circular by  the  Government  to  make  the  best judgment assessment  so that thare may not be any difference in the  procedure  to  be  adopted  by  different  assessing authoritias and  uniform basis provided is always just, fair and reasonable  so that the Assessing Authority  will have a uniform and satisfied principle or procedure in that behalf. Accordingly, we do not find any illegality in the order passed by the High Court warranting interference. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Petitioner is lessee  winnover  in respect of  the miner mineral viz. Sand Stone at Banthali, District Tonk.

" ORDER 1.We  have  heard  Shri K.K.  Venugopal,  learned  senior counsel,  for  Dr H. Borobabu Singh, in support of  the  two applications that have been made.  In view of the peremptory terms of the earlier order dated February 5, 1993  requiring the  Union Government to secure the presence of Dr Singh  in Court  today, we should not have permitted any  interception of  those steps.  However, on the impassioned plea  of  Shri K.K.  Venugopal,  who  sought  an  audience  on  these   two applications,  we  have  heard  him  at  length.   We   have considered his submissions.  Having regard to the  qualified stand made manifest in the applications and affidavit, we do not  think  that  we  should interrupt  the  course  of  the execution  of  the  earlier order.  This  we  say  with  due respect  to  the high office, Dr  Borobabu  Singh  otherwise holds  as a Speaker of the Assembly.  But, as has been  made clear  in  the  earlier  orders, it is  not  in  Dr  Singh’s capacity  as Speaker of the House as such that Dr  Singh  is being proceeded against, but in a different capacity.  It is unfortunate  that Dr Singh has, by his own persistent  stand of defiance of the jurisdiction and authority of this Court, brought this situation.  This is, indeed, regrettable. 2.But this Court must maintain its dignity and authority. It  is  in this spirit that we direct the execution  of  the earlier  order dated February 5, 1993 and the production  of Dr Singh before this Court. 3.Now  that  Dr  Borobabu Singh  has,  in  his  affidavit stated,  that if we refuse his prayer for exemption,  he  is willing  to appear before us, we appreciate the stand of  Dr Singh and expect him to, be present in Court at 2.00 p.m. 4.

" O R D E R Title to  29 acres of agricultural land, its possession and recovery of mense profits, was sought by the respondent- temple from  the appellants.  The trial  court dismissed the suit. A  learned Single  Judge of the High Court, in appeal, in re-appraising  the  evidence  adduced,  prominently  paid attention to  two  documents  containing  certain  recitals, which partly  supported the  case  of  the  plaintiff-temple respondent and  partly that  of  the  defendants-appellants. Reading them  together, the  learned Single  Judge aimed  to reconcile  the   entries  instead   of   holding   them   as inconsistent. He  made an  attempt to gather the predominant intention of the concerned authorities while preparing those documents, by  looking  at  both  of  them  integrally.  The dispute plainly  was whether the grant made in favour of the Archaka was  meant to  be conferred  on him personally or on the temple through the Archaka. The trial court, as also the learned Single Judge held that the grant was personal to the Archaka and thus the alienations made by him thereafter were in order.  The result  thereof was  that the decision of the trial court  dismissing the  suit was  upheld by the learned Single Judge.  Further bout  fought by the temple-respondent before the  Letters Patent  Bench of  the  High  Court  bore results inasmuch  as the  Bench, on  fresh reconciliation of those two  documents, bearing  in mind the other surrounding circumstances, came  to the view that the grant was intended to be  in favour  of the  temple  and  not  to  the  Archaka personally. Mr. Ram  Kumar, learned  counsel  for  the  appellants, inter alia  contends that  the Letters  Patent Bench  of the High Court  could not  have upset a finding of fact recorded by a learned Single Judge on fresh reconciliation of the two documents, arriving  at different results than those arrived at earlier  by the  two courts  aforementioned.  Though  the argument sounds  attractive,  it  does  not  bear  scrutiny. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Against the  orders of  the trial  court, first  appeal  lay before the  High Court,  both on facts as well as law. It is the internal  working of the High Court which splits it into different ’Benches’ and yet the court remains one. A Letters Patent Appeal,  as permitted  under the  Letters Patent,  is normally an intra-court appeal whereunder the Letters Patent Bench, sitting  as a  Court of  Correction. corrects its own orders in exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the Single  Bench. Such is not an appeal against an order of a subordinate Court. In such appellate jurisdiction the High Court  exercises   the  powers  of  a  Court  of  Error.  So understood, the  appellate power under the Letters Patent is quite distinct, in contrast to what is ordinarily understood in procedural  language. That  apart the construction of the aforementioned two documents involved, in the very nature of their import,  a mixed question of law and fact, well within the posers  of the Letters Patent Bench to decide. The Bench was not powerless in that regard. We are  therefore of  the view  that the Letters Patent Bench  committed  no  error  in  re-doing  the  exercise  to reconcile those two questioned documents so as to get to the result in  favour of  the temple-respondent.  Except for the point afore  dealt with.  no other  point has been raised by learned counsel. For the  foregoing reasons,  this appeal  fails and  is hereby dismissed. No costs.","Title to  29 acres of agricultural land, its possession and recovery of mense profits, was sought by the respondent- temple from the appellants.

" Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Venkataswami Hon’ble Mr. Justice V.N. Khare Hardev Singh,  Sr. Adv.,  Ms. Madhu  Moolchandani, Adv. with him for the appellant Rajiv Nanda and T. Sridharan, Advs. for the Respondents The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R K. Venkataswami, j. The appellant  approached  the  central  Administrative Tribunal for the relief that he is entitled to the pay-scale of Lecturer  in Commercial  arts though  he was appointed to the post  of ’Studio Artist’. In addition to that he claimed the  difference  in  the  salary  from  the  year  1971.  He approached the  Tribunal for  this relief  in May. 1989. The Tribunal accepted  the claim of the appellant that he should be paid  the salary of Lecturer in Commercial Arts though he was appointed  to the post of ’Studio Artist’ in View of the fact that  he was  performing  the  duties  of  Lecturer  in Commercial Arts. However, the Tribunal granted the relief of difference in  backwages from  May, 1988  only on the ground that under  Section 21  of the  Administrative Tribunals Act the period  of one  year  is  prescribed  for  redressal  of grievances. Against  the decision  of the  Tribunal that the appellant is  entitled to  be paid the salary of Lecturer in Commercial Arts  though he  was appointed as ’Studio Artist’ the respondents have not filed any appeal. The appellant has preferred this  appeal claiming  the difference in backwages from the date of his posting as Lecturer in Commercial Arts. Learned counsel  appearing for  the appellant submitted that before  approaching  the  Tribunal  the  appellant  was making  number   of  representations   to  the   appropriate authorities claiming  the relief and that was the reason for not approaching  the Tribunal  earlier than May, 1989. We do not think  that such  an excuse can be advanced to claim the difference in backwages from the year 1971. In Administrator of Union  Territory of  Daman and Diu & Ors. Vs. R.D. Valand 1995 Supp(4) SCC 593 this court while setting aside an order of Central  Administrative Tribunal  has observed  that  the Tribunal was not justified in putting the clock back by more http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 than 15  years and  the Tribunal  fell into  patent error in brushing aside  the question of limitation by observing that the respondent  has been making representations from time to time and  as such  the limitation would not come in his way. In the  light of the above decision, we cannot entertain the arguments of  the learned counsel for the appellant that the difference in  backwages should  be paid right from the year 1971. At the same time we do not think that the Tribunal was right in invoking section 21 of the Administrative Tribunals Act for restricting the difference by backwages by one year. In the  facts and  circumstances of  the case,  we hold that the  appellant is  entitled to  get the  difference  in backwages  from   May,  1986.  The  appeal  is  disposed  of accordingly with no order as to costs.","The appellant approached the central Administrative Tribunal for the relief that he is entitled to the pay-scale of Lecturer in Commercial Arts though he was appointed to the post of ’Studio Artist’ The Tribunal accepted the claim of the appellant that he should be paid the salary.

" JUDGMENT ORDER We have heard learned Counsel for the parties. We are disposing of all the four appeals by a common order. These appeals arise out of a suit filed in 1947 and subsequent Proceedings. The suit was for a sum of Rs. 7,000/- and there was an order for attachment before judgment of the dry fish of the defendant. A third party claimed ownership of the dry fish and he applied for release of the attachment order. It is not necessary to give further details of the case because the facts involved are very complicated stretching over 60 years. Therefore, with the consent of learned counsel for the parties we cut short the matter and direct that the entire property which is the subject matter of this litigation may be divided in equal shares between the two parties. Half share should be given to the appellants and the other half should be given to the respondents. To decide which part should go to the appellants and which part should go to the respondents, as many properties are involved, it is just and proper that this exercise may be done by the District Judge, Kanyakumari at Nagercoil himself or by the Additional District Judge nominated by the District Judge. The District Judge may issue notices to both  parties and divide the properties in two equal shares. If any person has any grievance against the order passed by the District Judge (or A.D.J., as the case may be), it will be open for either of the parties to approach this Court for further clarification. The District Judge, Kanyakumari, Nagercoil (or A.D.J. nominated by him) is directed to dispose of the matter preferably within a period of six months. Let all the records which are available here be transmitted to the District Judge, Kanyakumari, Nagercoil. The appeals are accordingly disposed of in the above terms. Before parting with this case, we again express our deep concern at the delay in disposing of cases in our Courts. Recently in Civil Appeal No. 1307 of 2001 titled Rajindra Singh (Dead) thr. Lrs. & Ors. v. Prem Mai & Ors. decided on 23rd August, 2007 we had expressed our deep anguish about this situation, and had observed that because of delay in disposal of cases people in this country are fast losing faith in the judiciary. We saw in the media news of lynching of suspected thieves in Bihar’s Vaishali District, the gunning down of an undertrial prisoner outside Patna City Civil Court, and other incidents where people have taken the law into their own hands. This is obviously because many people have started thinking that justice will not be done in the Courts due to the delays in Court proceedings. This is indeed an alarming state of affairs, and we once again http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 request the concerned authorities to do the needful in the matter urgently before the situation goes totally out of control.",Supreme Court of India dismisses four appeals by a common order.

" JUDGMENT 2003 (3) SCR 344 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Not satisfied with and aggrieved by the order dated 9.11.1995, passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, this appeal is filed, calling in question the correctness and validity of the directions given to the appellants to pay salary to the respondents as admissible to similarly placed employees of the University, including their arrears. The respondents were serving as Library Assistants and Library Attendants in the Seminar Library of the Centre for Advanced Study in Psychology, Post-graduate Department, Utkal University. They filed writ petitions seeking directions to the appellant to treat them as regular employees and pay them salary on par with the similarly placed employees working in the University on regular basis. The High Court while rejecting the contentions of the respondents for regularisation of their services, gave directions to the appellants to pay salary to the respondents as admissible to similar employees of the University. The learned counsel for the appellants pointed out to letters of appointment of the respondents to the effect that their appointments were made on a consolidated salary of Rs. 600 and Rs, 400 per month, initially and subsequently on the same terms and conditions but increasing the amount to Rs. 1000 per month. In the absence of any appointment order appointing the respondents on regular pay-scale, the respondents were not entitled to any regular pay scale as was admissible to the similarly placed employees of the University. According to the learned counsel, merely looking to the office order dated 2.12.1994 wherein reference is made to appointment orders but it is said that they shall draw their salary accordingly as per rules, they were not entitled for salary as per regular pay-scale. Learned counsel also pointed out to subsequent .order dated 16.1.1995, in which it is stated that the consolidated remuneration of Rs. 1000 per month was to be paid; mere reference to the payment as per rules in the order dated 2.12.1994 cannot be read in isolation. Per contra, the learned counsel representing the respondents relying on the office order dated 2.12.1994, submitted that the order passed by the High Court is perfectly valid and sustainable. The learned counsel also brought to our notice that subsequent to the passing of the impugned order the services of the respondents were terminated and challenging the order of termination of their services they have filed separate writ petitions which are pending before disposal in the High Court. Under these circumstances, the question of regularisation of services of the respondents does not survive. At any rate the High Court was right in rejecting their claims for regularisation and the respondents have not challenged the same by filing any appeal against that order. As regards the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 directions for payment of salary on par with the similarly placed employees in the University, we find it difficult to sustain the direction given by the High Court. It is not disputed that the respondents do not have any appointment orders on the basis of which they could claim pay-scales or a regular salary. Except the office order dated 2.12.1994, there is nothing to support the claims of the respondents for payment of salary as is admissible to the regular employees of the University. One sentence in the order dated 2.12.1994, that the respondents could ""draw their salary accordingly as per rules"", cannot give any right to them. That sentence cannot be read in isolation. The said office order must be understood in the light of the appointment orders issued to the respondents. In this view, we have no hesitation to set aside the direction given by the High Court to the effect that the respondents are entitled to salary as admissible to the similarly placed employees of the University. The appeal is allowed. The impugned order, so far as it relates to giving direction in regard to payment of salary, is set aside. No costs.","The respondents were serving as Library Assistants and Library Attendants in the Seminar Library of the Centre for Advanced Study in Psychology, Post-graduate Department, Utkal University.

" JUDGMENT 2002 (2) SCR 103 The following Order of the Court was delivered : In the instant case, duty is sought to be levied by the respondent by taking recourse to the extended period of limitation under Section l IA of the Central Excises Act. The plea of the appellant is that it was established as a research organisation and had even been importing goods from abroad and getting exemption from payment of customs duty on the basis that it was a research organisation. In reply to the show cause notice in paragraph 2.3 it has been specifically stated that the appellant was under a bona fide belief that the goods emerged during the research and experiments were fully exempt from payment of duty and therefore, no further compliance with the provisions of Excise Law was called for. Mr. Lakshmikumaran submits that in view of this explanation, the provisions of Section 11A proviso were not applicable and he further submits that in actual fact the products supplied by the appellant emerged out of their research activity and no excise duty was payable. We are unable to agree with the learned counsel that what was supplied by the appellant would come within the meaning of the expression ""that the goods are produced during the carrying out of experiments or research"". It is quite obvious that the appellant had a technical expertise to manufacture sophisticated equipment on the orders placed on it even though the appellant is a Research & Development Organisation. As a result of its research it had acquired sufficient acumen to be able to manufacture the equipment tailor-made for the use of the purchaser. The equipment so manufactured in supply cannot be regarded as being a product of research. We, however, agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that on the facts of the present case, the extended period of limitation would not apply. Our attention has been drawn to the fact that the main object as per the Memorandum of Association whereby the appellant was established, was to carry out research etc. Furthermore, by letter dated 12th July, 1988, the Department of Electronics had recognised the appellant as a research and development unit. A similar recommendation was also made on 7th May, 1991 by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. Such recommendation entitled it to make imports from abroad without payment of customs duty. Under the circumstance, there is no reason to conclude that the appellant would not have believed that the goods manufactured by it and supplied were not liable for payment of excise duty. There does not appear to be any tangible basis for the Department to come to the conclusion that there was wilful suppression for evasion of duty by the appellant. This being so, while duty was leviable on the goods manufactured by the appellant the Department, however, could not invoke the extended period of limitation of five year under Section l IA of the Act. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is allowed.",Appellant had been importing goods from abroad and getting exemption from payment of customs duty on the basis that it was a research organisation.

It has been held that under Entries 77, 78, 95 of List I, Entry 65 of List II and Entry 11A of List III, the Parliament and State Legislatures possess legislative competence to effect changes in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. 4.      However, in none of the decisions rendered so far the question as to what extent such powers of High Court can be transferred to Tribunals, excepting judicial review under Articles 226/227 has not been considered.  There is as yet no demarcating line to show that, except for powers exercised under Article 226 & 227, the Parliament has the legislative competence to vest intrinsic judicial functions, traditionally performed by Courts in any Tribunal or Authority, outside the judiciary.  The question to be determined is whether such ’wholesale transfer of powers’ as contemplated by the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002 would offend the constitutional scheme of separation of powers and independence of judiciary, so as to aggrandize one branch over http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the other. 5.      Since the issues raised in the appeals are of seminal importance and are likely to have serious impact on the very structure and independence of the judicial system, we are of the view that the issue with regard to the constitution of the Tribunals and the areas of their jurisdiction needs to be given a fresh look and therefore, the matter deserves to be heard by a Constitution Bench.","The challenge in these appeals is to the validity of the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 as amended by the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. Heard learned counsel on both sides. Notification  under   Section  4   (1)  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894  [for  short,  the  ’Act""]  was  last published on April 10, 1989 acquiring a large extent of land admeasuring  8,61,515  sq.mtr.  for  public  purpose,  viz., industrial development;  the land  was at  that time fit for cultivation  but   possessed  of  potential  value  and  was situated in outskirts of Surat. The Land Acquisition Officer in his  award dated  April 15,  1991 awarded  compensation @ Rs.5/- per  sq.mtr. On  reference, the extra Assistant Judge by his  award and  decree dated  April 19, 1994 enhanced the compensation to  Rs.25/- per  sq.mtr. On  appeal by both the claimants as  well  as  the  State,  the  High  Court  while dismissing the  appeals of  the State  further enhanced  the compensation to  Rs.33/- per  sg.mtr. Thus  these appeals by special leave. Though the  land was  waste land but being possessed of potent value  was fit  for building purposes and is situated in outskirts of industrial city, the courts below were right in taking into consideration potential value of the land for determination of  compensation. In awards for lands notified under Section  4(1) published  between December 15, 1986 and December 29,  1989, compensation was awarded in the range of Rs. 4.75 per sq.mtr. to Rs. 7/per sq.mtr. In respect of land situated in lchhapur to a extent of around 908 sq. mtr., the market value  was in  the range of Rs.33 per sq.mtr. Relying upon that, the High Court enhanced the compensation. In view of the fact that the lands are situated at a distance of two kilometers from  the acquired  lands reliance  on sale deed, Ex.22 by the High Court was wholly unjustified in law. It is accordingly excluded.  However, we  agree that the lands are possessed of  potential value,  as found  by all  the courts below. No prudent  purchaser would  purchase large  extent  of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 land on  the basis  of sale of a small extent of land in the open market.  The acid test the court should always adopt in determining  market   value  in  the  matter  of  compulsory acquisition would  be to  eschew feats of imagination sit in the arm  chair of  a prudent  willing purchaser,  it  should consider whether  the willing  vendee would  offer the  rate which  the   trial   court   proposes   to   determine   the compensation. Taking  these facts into consideration, we are of the  view that  the reasonable  and adequate compensation for the  lands would  be at net rate of Rs.22/- per sq.mtr., after giving  deduction  of  1/3rd  of  the  amount  towards developmental chargers.  Therefore, the  claimants would  be entitled to the compensation @ Rs. 22/- per sq.mtr. They are also entitled  to the  statutory benefits  on  the  enhanced compensation. The appeal are accordingly allowed. No costs.","Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was last published on April 10, 1989.

While that  stay  was  in operation,  he came to be relieved from his post on  October 4, 1991, which was clearly contrary to the letter and spirit of  the  Tribunal’s order.

In  fact  the appellant  can  have  a grievance that  the  respondent  had committed  contempt by not obeying the interim order of  the Tribunal.

" JUDGMENT ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted. The appeals were essentially directed against the interim orders passed by the Orissa High Court directing, in offence, restraining the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (in short ‘the Commission’) - appellant herein from taking steps in the matter of fixation of tariff for the periods 2002-03 and 2003-04. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the appellant placed before us an order dated 02.09.2003 in Misc. Case Nos. 1380 and 1805 of 2003 by which the earlier orders were modified and the Commission was permitted to decide on the question of fixation of tariff for the aforesaid two periods. The writ petitioners before the High Court, who are respondent Nos. 2 to 13 in these appeals have not appeared inspite of service of notice. From the order dated 02.09.2003, it is clear that the High Court virtually recalled the order of restraint on the exercise of power of the Commission. But at the same time, the High Court has kept the matters pending for the purpose of monitoring the action of the Commission. We find these orders to be rather strange. The interim orders passed by the High Court restraining the Commission from exercising its functions are indefensible. After the High Court had permitted the Commission to take necessary decision, the Commission has, in fact, taken decision and has fixed the tariff for the two periods. It is also not disputed that levy is being made on the basis of tariff so fixed. It is not in dispute that correctness of the tariff fixed can be questioned before the prescribed forum, as provided in the Orissa Electricity Reform, Act, 1994. That being so, there was no necessity for the High Court to keep the writ petitions pending. As the Commission has already taken decisions, the tariffs have been fixed and levys are being made, nothing further needs to be done in these appeals except directing the High Court to treat the Writ Petition as having become infructuous. The appeals are accordingly disposed of. In view of this order, the notice of contempt issued by the High Court and the contempt proceedings stand quashed.","The appeals were essentially directed against the interim orders passed by the Orissa High Court.

The appellant herein has been convicted for the offence punishable under Sections 27 9 and 304-A of the Indian Penal Code (for short, ‘the IPC’).  The trial Court convicted the appellant and ordered him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one and half years and to pay fine of     Rs. 300/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months under Section 304-A and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and to pay fine of Rs. 100/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month under section 279 IPC. The Sessions Court as well as the High Court confirmed the order of conviction and sentence. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the Courts below were wrong in recording conviction and imposing punishment on the appellant.  In our opinion, so far as the conviction is concerned, the trial Court after appreciating the evidence on record passed an order of conviction and sentence.

" J U D G M E N T O R D E R Leave granted. Heard the petitioner in person and learned counsel appearing for the respondent. We have also perused the counter affidavits and rejoinders along with the written submissions filed by the parties. The present appeal arises out of an interim order dated 11.1.2002 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi in the course of proceedings instituted by the present appellant claiming to be the second wife of the respondent for grant of maintenance to her under section 18 read with section 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act [for short the Act]. The learned Single Judge on the original side of the High Court in the pending proceeding under the Act has by order dated 11.1.2002 granted an interim maintenance of Rs. 400/- per month to the wife. The wife appealed to the Division Bench of the High Court. By order dated 25.7.2003 which is the subject matter of this appeal, the interim maintenance has been increased to Rs.700/- per month. Not satisfied with the increase in the amount of interim maintenance granted by the Division Bench, the wife has approached this Court seeking further enhancement  of rate of interim maintenance. By this appeal, interim maintenance @ Rs. 12,000/- per month has been claimed on the ground that the respondent/husband has taken voluntary retirement  from the Bank’s services and has received substantial amount of retiral benefits. It is stated that he is possessed of valuable properties and assets which are sufficient to pay higher amount of maintenance to the wife to enable her to maintain a reasonable standard of living to which the parties are accustomed. The husband is contesting the maintenance proceeding both on the ground of competence of the present wife to claim maintenance and the quantum. Normally, this Court would not have entertained this appeal as it is directed against an order fixing only interim maintenance pending adjudication of claim of maintenance by the wife under the Act. On the prima facie evidence with regard to the social and financial status of the parties, this Court finds that interim maintenance of Rs. 700/- per month fixed by the Division Bench of the High Court is extremely low. Therefore, after notice issuing on the Special Leave Petition, this appeal is entertained. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Before the High Court, it appears that at one stage, reconciliation efforts were made in which the husband had agreed to provide second floor of the accommodation owned by him for separate residence of the wife with Rs. 1,500/- per month as permanent alimony to her during her life. Efforts of reconciliation, however, failed as at a later stage, the wife backed out. The copies of orders passed by the Division Bench of High Court on 13.2.2003 and 17.2.2003, in the course of reconciliation proceedings, have been produced by the parties in this appeal. As the legal right of the second wife to claim maintenance under the Act and its quantum are hotly contested issues in the main case, we refrain from expressing any opinion on merit of the claims and contentions of the parties. For the purpose of fixing appropriate amount of interim maintenance, we may assume that the financial position of husband is such that he can easily pay a sum of Rs.1,500/- per month as interim maintenance without disturbing the right of separate residence provided to the wife at the second floor of the husband’s premises. The appeal, therefore, is partly allowed by increasing the amount of interim maintenance to Rs. 1,500/- per month which shall be payable at the above rate from the month of May, 2004 until decision of the main case pending under the Act on the original side of the High Court. It is made clear that the High Court shall decide the main case on merits uninfluenced by orders passed for fixing interim maintenance. In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs in this appeal.",Appeal arises out of an interim order dated 11.1.2002 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi in the course of proceedings instituted by the present appellant claiming to be the second wife of the respondent.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The  respondent  herein  on  supply  of  goods  to  the appellants raised bills which were partly cleared. Since the balance was  substantial  and  the  appellants  a  statutory authority and  its representatives, the respondent moved the High Court  of Orissa  in a writ Petition for a direction so as to  recover the  balance outstanding.  The High  Court on entertainment of  the Writ  Petition came  to grips  of  the matter inclusive  of the  objection by the appellants that a civil  suit  was  the  appropriate  remedy.  Overruling  the objection, the  High Court  was moved  by the  fact that the writ petitioner  before it,  i.e.,the respondent herein, had undeniably supplied  the goods  at the rate quoted by it and that the  appellants had  after taking delivery utilised the said goods,  which factum was not disputed. It took the view that when  the facts were admitted, there was no justifiable reason on  the part  of the appellants not to pay the amount due to  the respondent when it had supplied the goods to the appellants. It  is, in  these circumstances,  that the  High Court ordered payment of the quoted price of goods supplied, allowing the  writ petition. That view of the High Court has been put to challenge here. We do  not wish  either to comment on the step taken or the view  arrived at  by the High Court in these proceedings since we  find that  before the High Court the appellants in their counter  had pleaded that since they had been put to a loss of  Rs.43,16,400/- due  to high  quotations they  had a right to  withhold that  amount for  being paid-over  to the respondent. On  the other  hand, in  the  pleadings  of  the respondent herein,  before the  High Court,  as  also  here, claim is  laid that a sum of Rs.66,09,669.36 was outstanding and had been wrongly withheld. Interwining these two claims, it would  become apparent that a sum of about Rs. 23 lacs on the parties’  own showing  is not  disputed to be due to the respondent towards  its claims.  For this reason, we explain http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 away the  orders of  the High  Court by  ordering  that  the appellants shall  pay without  prejudice a sum of Rs.23 lacs to the  respondent towards part clearance of the outstanding bills and  sequally the  orders of  the High  Court shall be meant to confine to the payment of Rs.23 lacs, which is more or less  not disputed,  as payable.  Regarding  the  balance claim of  respondent, since it is disputed, it would have to move  the  civil  court  claiming  it  in  a  regular  suit. Necessarily accounting  will be resorted to in that suit and the sums  of moneys already paid to the respondent inclusive of the sum of Rs.23 lacs, as ordered to be paid today, would have to  be reckoned  in finalizing  the accounts. We, thus, modifyingly clarify  the High Court’s orders confining it to ordering  the  above  payment  of  Rs.23  lacs  leaving  all questions open  inclusive of  the claim  to interest  on all payments made  delayedly to  be  settled  before  the  civil court. The  appeal would  stand disposed  of accordingly. No costs.","The High Court ordered payment of the quoted price of goods supplied, allowing the writ petition.

Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short, the ‘Act’) acquiring a large chunk on land was  published on  June  26,  1982.  The  Special  Land Acquisition Officer  had given his award under Section 11 on February  27,  1989  granting  compensation  @  Rs.  50  and Rs.37.50 per  sq.yd. It  also granted  solatium and interest under the  Act as  vL 1984  Amendment Act.  That  award  was allowed to  become  final.  The  question  is;  whether  the members  of   the  appellant-Association   are  entitled  to compensation? In view of the fact that the award has already become final,  the stand  taken  by  the  Awash  Evam  Vikas Parishad that  they are not liable to pay solatium under the amended Act  and the  claimants are entitled to get interest at 15% and 6% under the Schedule to the U.P Awash Evam Vikas Adhiniyam, cannot  be  countenanced.  The  Land  Acquisition Officer has  filed his  counter affidavit.  Therein, he  has stated  that   for  the  land  admeasuring  1157.895  acres, compensation in  a sum of Rs.52,05,94,187.90 was determined. Out of  which  Rs.  42,15,00,000/-  was  deposited  and  the balance amount was agreed to be deposited as admitted by the Teller dated  December 10,  1992 of  the Commissioner,  Shri Rajiv Kumar  Singh. The balance amount of Rs. 3,26,22,583,25 is,  therefore,  payable  to  them.  The  liability  to  pay interest arises only when the Land Acquisition Officer takes possession of  the land after the award comes to be made. It is states  on behalf  of the Parishad that the possession of an extent  of only 9.2 acres of land alone was delivered and the rest  of the land has not been delivered and the rest of the land  has not  been delivered.  In view of the fact that the liability  to pay the interest arises only free the date of taking  possession and  as it  is claimed that the entire extent of  the land  has not been given possession, the Land Acquisition Officer  is directed  to determine  as  to  what extent of  the area possession of which has been given after the award;  for those  claimants whose lands have been taken http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 possession, interest  shall be  calculated as  per the award from the  date of taking possession till date of deposit and interest shall  accordingly be  deposited within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of the judgment.

The appellant had taken a loan from respondent No. 1, which is a co- operative bank registered under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as the ’Act’).  Since the appellant was in default in payment of the loan, recovery proceedings were taken under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Rules, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the ’Rules’). 4.      In pursuance to the recovery, recourse was taken to the procedure for attachment and sale of the property of the appellant prescribed in Rule 107 of the Rules, framed under the Act.  An auction was held for sale of the appellants’ properties.  Under Rule 107(11)(g) of the Rules, 15% of the price of the immovable property has to be deposited by the auction purchaser at the time of the purchase, and the remaining 85% of the purchase money has to be paid within 15 days from the date of such sale.  Admittedly, in the present case, the aforesaid 85% of the purchase money was not paid within 15 days from the date of the sale nor even thereafter. 4.      In Manilal Mohanlal Shah and others vs. Sardar Sayed Ahmed Sayed Mahmad and another AIR 1954 SC 349, it has been held that in such circumstances there is no sale at all if the balance purchase money is not paid within 15 days.  It is not a mere irregularity.  Non-payment of the said amount renders the sale proceedings a complete nullity. 5.      In Balram  vs. Ilam Singh and others 1996 (5) SCC 705, it has been held that the obligation of the purchaser to deposit the full purchase money within time is a mandatory requirement and non-compliance of the rule renders the sale a nullity and not a mere irregularity. 6.      In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the auction sale of the appellants’ property was a nullity, and there was no valid auction sale. 7.      In view of the above, the appeals are  allowed.  The impugned judgment is set aside and it is held that there was no valid sale of the appellant’s property. 8.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAGHUBAR  DAYAL,,  J.-This  appeal,  by  special  leave,  is against  the order of the Madras High Court  dismissing  the application for quashing the commitment of the case  against http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the  appellant,  to  the  Court of  Session,  for  trial  of offences of criminal conspiracy to cheat under s. 120-B read with  s.  420,  Indian Penal Code, and for  the  offence  of forgery  committed  in pursuance of  that  conspiracy.   The criminal  conspiracy  is alleged to have been  committed  at Calcutta.  The other offences in pursuance of the conspiracy are  alleged to have been committed within the  jurisdiction of  the  Court of Session at Madras.  The quashing  of.  the commitment  was  sought on the ground that,  the  Courts  at Madras had no jurisdiction to try the offence of conspiracy. The  High Court did not accept the contention and  dismissed the application. The  sole  question  for consideration  in  this  appeal  is whether  the  offence  of conspiracy alleged  to  have  been committed  at Calcutta can be tried by the Court of  Session at Madras. We have held this day, in Purushottamdas Dalmia v.     The State of West Bengal (1) that the Court having (1) [1962] 2S.C.R. 101. 118 jurisdiction  to try the offence of criminal conspiracy  can also try offences committed in pursuance of that  conspiracy even   if   those  offences  were  committed   outside   the jurisdiction  of  that Court, as the provisions of  s.  239, Criminal   Procedure  Code,  are  not  controlled   by   the provisions  of s. 177, Criminal Procedure Code,which do  not create an absolute prohibition against the trial of offences by a Court other than the one within whose jurisdiction  the offence  is committed.  On a parity of reasoning, the  Court having  jurisdiction  to  try  the  offences  committed   in pursuance  of the conspiracy, can try the offence  of  con,- ,piracy  even if it was committed outside its  jurisdiction. We  therefore  hold that the order under appeal  is  correct and, accordingly, dismiss this appeal. Appeal dismissed.",This appeal is against the order of the Madras High Court dismissing the application for quashing the commitment of the case. The quashing  of. the commitment was sought on the ground that the Courts at Madras had no jurisdiction to try the offence of conspiracy. The High Court did not accept the contention and dismissed the application.,criminal,45.79
" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum. The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 1144, Sector-14(P), Hisar on 21.8.1986.  The Respondent paid substantial amounts but the possession was not delivered.  Thus the Respondent filed a complaint.  On these facts, the District Forum awarded interest @ 15% p.a. on the entire deposited amount. The State Forum dismissed the Appeal and confirmed the Order of the District Forum.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission dismissed the Revision filed by the Appellants relying upon its own decision in the case of Haryana Urban Development Authority v. Darsh Kumar and observing that interest @ 18% p.a. has been awarded by them under similar circumstances. As has been stated in so many matters, the Order of the National Commission cannot be sustained.  It cannot dispose of the matters by confirming award of interest irrespective of the facts of that case.  The National Commission may, on facts of a case, award http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 compensation/damages under a head set out in Balbir Singh’s case (supra) if it concludes that such an award is justified. The Order of the National Forum accordingly stands set aside. In this case possession has been given on 12th November 1997. Appellants have also paid a sum of Rs.80,767/- on 29th May 2000. However, whilst paying this amount they have deducted TDS.   As these are payments towards compensation/damages for mental agony and harassment TDS   could not have been deducted.    The Appellants shall pay to the Respondent within one month from date of this Order the amount deducted as TDS with interest thereon at 12% from date of deduction till payment.  In our view the payment already made and the refund of TDS amount will be sufficient recompense. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases. With these observations, the Appeal stands disposed of with no order as to costs.",A large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Having heard the counsel on both sides, we are satisfied that there is no need to disturb the findings recorded by the High Court. However, the High Court having found the appellant in possession of the land after he had purchased the property from the erstwhile landlord of the respondent, a protected tenant under the provisions of the Hyderabad Tenancy And Agricultural Land Act, 1950; and so, needed some protection, it directed appointment of receiver. In view of the finding that the appellant is in possession, we feel that in the interest of justice, the appellant would continue in possession but should deposit a sum of Rs.10,000/- every year from the year 1991 onwards to the credit of the suit and keep depositing the same till the disposal of the suit etc. In the event of the respondent succeeding in the suit, he is entitled to withdraw the same. As soon as the appellant shall deposit the arrears as on date within a period of three months from today and before 31st January of each year, the trial court is directed to keep that amount in interest yielding deposit securities in a nationalised Bank. In the event of the respondent’s succeeding, he would be entitled to withdraw the amount with interest accrued thereon. The trial court is directed to dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of this order.

" AND CIVIL APPEAL NO.1579 OF 1996 (Arising out of SLP (C) No.12432 of 1995) O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard the counsel on both sides. These appeals by special  leave arise  from the  judgments of the Division Bench of  the Patna  High  Court  in  CWJC  Nos.7049/93  and 1801/90 made respectively on August 19, 1994 and December 6, 1994. The  question is  vexed  inter  se  seniority  of  the appellant and  the respondent-employees  in these cases. The appellant was  admittedly appointed  on temporary  basis  in March 1966  and thereafter  he was drafted as a Commissioned Officer and  served in the Army in defence of the country in national emergency.  After discharge  from the  Army, he was appointed  on  regular  basis  on  September  6,  1966.  The respondent-employees  came  to  be  appointed  initially  on September  29,   1964  on  temporary  basis  and  were  then appointed on regular basis as Civil Assistant Surgeon w.e.f. July 15,  1974. The  question is  whether the  appellant  is entitled to  his seniority  w.e.f.  September  6,  1966  and thereby would  become  senior  to  the  respondent-employees though they  were initially  appointed  on  temporary  basis w.e.f. September 29, 1964. Circular dated September 20, 1965 issued by  the Government  with regard to the entitlement of the Army Officers is found in Annexure VI. The relevant part reads thus: ""Besides the facilities in the Army, all temporary officers  are allowed  lien in service in  accordance with  Govt, order No.7892(B)  dated   10.12.62.   It   has further been accepted by Government that of  the   existing  permanent  vacancies would  be  reserved  for  the  temporary assistant  surgeons  who  volunteers  to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 join the  Army  and  they  would  be  on probation with  effect from  the date on which they  join the Army service and on completion of  two years of satisfactory service, they  will be  confirmed in the State Medical Service."" As a  consequence of the above circular, on appointment to the  post and on completion of the probation for a period of two  years, the candidate would be confirmed in the cadre as Civil  Assistant  Surgeon  in  the  Bihar  State  Medical Service. It  is  settled  law  that  on  completion  of  the satisfactory probation,  his confirmation would date back to the date  of his  initial appointment.  Admittedly,  he  was regularly appointed  on September  6, 1966. Consequently, he was regularly  appointed as  Civil Assistant  Surgeon w.e.f. September 6, 1966. It is  true that  the respondent-employees  came to  be appointed pursuant  to the  recommendations dated  April 17, 1964 made  by the  Bihar State Public Service Commission and were  appointed   on  September   29,  1964.   But  all  the appointments are  only to  temporary posts  though they were selected by  the Bihar  Public Service Commission on regular basis. They  were admittedly confirmed w.e.f. July 15, 1974. Under these  circumstances,  the  regular  service  for  the purpose  of  seniority  as  regards  the  respondents  would commence only  from July  15, 1974,  of  course,  for  other benefits, their  appointments would date back to the date of their  initial   temporary  appointment.  Consequently,  the appellant  becomes   senior  to  them.  Resultantly,  he  is entitled to  all  the  consequential  benefits  except  back wages. The appeals  are accordingly  allowed and  the order of the High Court is set aside.

" JUDGMENT 2000 (3) SCR 1201 The following Order of the Court was delivered : After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, we are of the view that the decision of this Court in Transport Corporation v. U.P. Parivahan Nigam Shikshak Berozgar Sangh, [1995] 2 SCC page 1, has laid down clear criteria as to regular appointment of apprentices governed by the Apprentices Act, 1961. The relevant principles are as follows : (i) Other things being equal, a trained apprentice should be given preference over direct recruits. (ii) For this, a trainee would be required to get his name sponsored by any employment exchange. The decision of this Court in Union of India v. Hargopal, AIR (1987) 227, would permit this. (iii) If age bar would come in the way of the trainee, the same would be relaxed in accordance with what is stated in this regard, if any, in the concerned service rule. If the service rule be silent on this aspect, relaxation to the extent of the period for which the apprentice has undergone training would be given. (iv) The concerned training institute would maintain a list of the person trained year wise. The persons trained earlier would be treated senior to the persons trained later. In between the trained apprentices, preference shall be given to those who are senior"". In the said judgment, this Court, however, observed at the end of para 13 as follows : ""In so far as the cases at hand are concerned, we find that the Corporation filed an additional affidavit in C.A. Nos. 4347-4354 of 1999 (as desired by the Court) on 20th October, 1992 giving position regarding vacancies in the posts of conductors and clerks. If such posts be still vacant, we directs the Corporation to act in accordance with what has been stated above regarding the entitlement of the trainees. We make it clear that while considering the cases of the trainees for giving employment in suitable posts, what has been laid down in the Service Regulations of the Corporation shall be followed, except that the trainees would not be required to appear in any written examina-tion, if any provided by the Regulations. It is apparent that before considering the cases of the trainees, the requirement of their names being sponsored by the employment exchange would not be insisted upon. In so far as the age requirement is concerned, the same shall be relaxed as indicated above"". A question has arisen before the Allahabad High Court in a later case as to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 whether the direction that the trainees need not undertake examination was applicable only to the petitioners in the case before this Court or whether pars 13 laid down any general principle that apprentices need not take the examination. This question went before a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Arvind Gautam v. State of U.P. & Ors., (Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 23076 of 1998), reported in (1999) 2 U.P. CBEL 1397. The Full Bench held that what was mentioned in para 13 was in the specific factual back- ground of the ""cases on hand"" and that the apprentices are to go through the examination as also the interview, as provided in the Recruitment Rules. The Full Bench had also approved the judgment in the case of Manoj Kumar Mishra v. State of U.P. & Ors., reported in (1997) 2 UP LEBC 1374 which took a similar view in regard to the interpretation of para 13 of the judgment of this Court mentioned above. We, are, therefore, of the opinion that the view taken in Manoj Kumar Mishra’s Case as also the view taken by the Full Bench in Arvind Gautam’a case, (supra) is a correct one and that apprentices have to go through the procedure of examination/interview and that they are however entitled to the benefits of entries (i) to (iv) laid down in Transport Corporation case [1995] 2 SCC 1.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both side. This appeal  by special  leave arises against the order of the  Central Administrative  Tribunal, New  Delhi made on February 8, 1996 in OA No. 1105/95. The admitted  position is  that the respondents came to be engaged  as drivers in Intelligence Bureau, Headquarters, New Delhi  from April  24, 1986 to October 5, 1988. They had filed the  O.A. for  regularisation of  their  services  The tribunal in  the impugned  order has  directed to regularise their serviced as stated hereunder: ""In   the    present   case,    the experience  of  the  applicants  in more  than  7  years.    They  are, therefore, entitled  in view of the ration of  the above  cited case to be considered for regularisation in relaxation   of   their   age   and educational   qualifications.    We accordingly,   dispose    of   this application with  the direction  to the  respondents  to  consider  the applicants  for  regularisation  on the availability of vacancies along with  others  after  granting  them necessary   educational   and   age relaxation ad  to continue  them in their present jobs, subject to work being available,  in preference  to any  other   worker  who  may  have lesser  experience   than  them  of working with the respondents. In view  of the settled legal position by this Court in State of  Haryana vs.  Piara Singh  [(1992) 4  SCC 118]  and plethora of precedents thereafter, the Tribunal obviously is in error  in directing regularisation of their services with effect from  the respective  dates  of  their  appointments, Instead, the  appellants are  directed to  regularise  their services in  accordance with  the rules  in the light of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 law laid down therein. It is  contended by learned counsel for the respondents that   the   appellants   have   relaxed   the   educational qualifications  in  respect  of  15  persons  named  in  the rejoinder and,  therefore, the respondents are also entitled to the  same benefit.  the  learned  Solicitor  General  has placed before us the rules made b the Government on February 4, 1988; Note (2) was appended to Rule 2 (iii) which read as under: ""All   the   persons   working   as Security      Assistant      (Motor Transport)    Immediately    before coming   into    force    of    the Intelligence     Bureau      (Motor Transport    Cadre)     Recruitment (Amendment) Rules,  1988  shall  be promoted    enbloc     as    junior Intelligence    Officer    Grade-II (Motor Transport)  Irrespective  of the  number  of  years  of  service rendered  by   them   as   Security Assistant (Motor Transport) against the  upgraded   post  of   Security Assistant  (Motor   Transport)   as Junior Intelligence Officer, Gr. II (Motor  Transport)   as  one   time exception."" It is stated that the previous cadre to which the above persons  came   to  be   appointed  was   abolished.  As   a consequence, all those persons working as Security Assistant (Motor Transport)  were en  bloc regularised  relaxing their educational qualifications  which is  only 6th standard and, therefore,  it  has  no  application  to  the  case  of  the respondents. In  view of  the above position, we do not find any hostile  discrimination meted out to the respondents, as contended by the learned counsel for the respondents.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Only  controversy   is  whether   the  first  appellant fulfilled the qualifications of 12th standard prescribed for consideration of  her  membership  of  the  Stock  Exchange. Admittedly, the  appellant passed Matric which is equivalent to 11th  standard in  Gujarat State,  Saurashtra region. The Saurashtra University Act, 1965 (Gujarat Act 39 of 1965) was amended by  the Gujarat Secondary Education (Amendment) Act, 1978, (Gujarat Act No. 32 of 1978) which was published after receipt of  the assent  of the  President  in  the  ""Gujarat Government Gazette"" on the 29th September, 1978.

The Explanation  there  to clearly  amplifies   that  the   ""Higher  Secondary   School Certificate  Examination""   means  the  examination  of  the students in the twelfth standard. The first appellant having passed the  eleventh standard examination was thus qualified for consideration  of membership  of the Stock Exchange.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  High Court of Patna made on November 7, 1974 in C.R. No. 300/74.  The appellant  filed the  suit  for  injunction restraining  the  respondents  from  interdicting  with  his possession and enjoyment of portion of  the property bearing plot No.  1323  and  the  structure  standing  thereon.  The appellant claimed that though the plot No. 1499 bounded with Khata No.  246 in  Touzi No.  3274 was  declared as  evacuee property, the  house  in  respect  of  which  the  appellant claimed is  situated in  a part of Khata No. 263 in Plot No. 1499 and  the same Touzi number, belongs to him. The learned Munsif had  taken the  view that  it is  required to have an adjudication at  the trial  of the suit whether the property bearing Khata  No. 263,  though situated in Plot No. 1499 of the same  Touzi No.  3274 was  his exclusive property or was not vested  in the  custodian of  the evacuee  property. The objection raised  by the  respondents was  rejected. In  the revision,  the  High  Court  has  taken  the  view  that  by operation of Sections 28 and 46 of the Administration of the Evacuee Property  Act,   1950, the  lands and  the buildings stood vested  in the  custodian of the evacuee Property Act, 1950, the  lands and  the  buildings  stood  vested  in  the custodian of  the evacuee  property and, therefore, the suit is not  maintainable. When the matter had come up this Court before grant  of leave,  the counsel  were herd  and it  was stated that the house or structure on plot No. 1499 was only a portion  and there  was no  claim that    it  was  evacuee property  in  respect  portion  of  plot  No.  1323  or  any structure  thereon.  Therefore,  this  Court  granted  leave concerning the question  of dispossession in respect of Plot No. 1499. In view  of the  fact that  the appellant  has  claimed exclusive title  in respect  of the property in dispute, the Court is  required to go into the question whether or not it is the  part of  the land  which  was  declared  as  evacuee property and  stood vested  in the  custodian of the evacuee property or  is appellant’s  exclusive property on the basis of  the  alleged  gift  said  to  have  been  given  to  the appellant. This  is a  question of fact to be adjudicated at http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the trial  of the  suit before  considering whether the land vested in  the custodian  of the  evacuee property.  If  the learned District Munsif would find that the suit property is the evacuee  property necessarily  if stands  vested in  the custodian of the evacuee property and thereby the civil suit is not maintainable. On the other hand, if the finding would be that  it is not part of the evacuee property, necessarily the injunction as claimed to be considered whether or not be granted.

" JUDGMENT NANAVATI. J. In this appeal, filed by some of the officers of the Himacahal Pradesh Government, what is called in question are the remarks made against  them  by  the  High  Court,  while disposing of Criminal Revision No.  56/82. Respondent  No.1  Mast  Ram  Tanta  was tried by the Court  of  Sub-Divisional  Magistrate,  Theog  for   certain offences  punishable  under  the  Indian  Penal Code and the Forest Act.   Respondnt  No.    1  pleaded  quilty  and  was sentenced to  pay fine only.  The High Courtfinding that the sentence imposed upon Respondent No.  1 was  inadequate,  in exercise  of  its  sub  moto  powers,  issued  notice to him calling him to show cause why the  sentence  should  not  be enhanced.   During  those  proceedings  the High Court found that the whole trial was conducted in an  unholy  haste  and there was  plea bargaining.  Therefore, instead of enhancing the sentence it thought it proper to quash the  whole  trial and remanded the case back to the trial court for conducting the trial   afresh.      While  disposing  of  the  Revision Application in that  manner  the  High  Court  made  certain observations against the present appellants. Having gone through the judgment, we find  that  the said  observations  are  part and parcel of the reasoning of the High Court and they have been  made  while  appreciating the evidence on record.

Thus, this appeal by special leave. The learned  counsel for the appellants has strenuously contended that  this Court  in C.A.  No.3496 of  1990 titled B.N. Saxena  vs. N.D.M.C. decided on July 25, 1990 read down the  rule   holding  that  after  the  initial  appointments experience gained  for a  considerable  length  of  time  is itself  a   qualification  for   promotion  and,  therefore, requirement of further qualification was bad in law. He also relied upon  another judgment  in State  of  U.P. & Ors. vs. J.P. Chaurasia  & Ors.  [(1989) 1 SCC 121]. Relying thereon, it  is  contended  that  the  rule  prescribing  educational qualifications as  one  of  the  qualifications  for  direct recruitment must  be read  down. So  read  down,  since  the appellants  have   the  necessary  experience,  it  must  be construed to  be a  qualification for  recruitment. The view taken by  the High Court and recruitment authority is had in law. We  find no  force in  that contention. It is seen that for the  direct recruitment only. The Government in the rule have prescribed  driving licence  and  also    knowledge  of Punjabi  language   upto   middle   standard   to   be   the qualification.  Therefore,   anyone  who   possesses   those qualification has  to be  considered for recruitment. Since, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 admittedly,.

According to the statement on behalf of the appellants, who are the claimants before  us, the language used therein clearly Indicates that the insured would also be covered under It, while submission on  behalf of the Insurance company is, this only co-relates to  the  damage of the property and has no correlation  with the personal injury or death of the insured. The  short  facts are that the apoellant filed a  suit for    recovery    of     Rs,      6,03;000/-    from    the defendant-respondent, insurance company.  The appellants are the  parents  of the rjeceased Mahendra Shirke, who died  in the accident on 8th January,  1980.  The said deceased obtained loan  from Maharashtra  Finance  Corporation and Bank of  Baroda  under ""educated Unemployment Scheme"" for purchasing goods truck In the  year  1977.   He  obtained  the  said  loan  under  the condition  that.   he will drive personally the said  truck. According  to  the appellants"" case, the  deceased  Mahendra insured  his  truck with the respondents to the tune of  Rs. 10 lakhs, which 1s a cornorehensive Insurance covering risks for  unlimited  personal  injury and property.  ’  The  said truck  was also Insured as per the policy to the tune of Rs. 1,27,000/-  for  the damage to the property.  It 1s  not  In dispute  that on the date of the accident the said truck was covered  with  the  said Insurance policy.   In  fact;   the question  which  we have to decide 1s the  Interpretation.of the policy Itself. On  these  facts, the trial court decreed the suit  in favour  of the appellants for the aforesaid amount alongwith interest @ 12% per annum.  The Trial Court while considering Issues  No.   1 and 9 after considaring the  submissions  of both the parties concludes that the payment of Rs.  134/- as premium was for the unlimited personal Injury to the life of the  insured  as well as to the property to the tune of  Rs. 10  lakhs and finally recorded its finding to the fol lowing effect:  - http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ""Moreover,  there 1s no iota of evidence to prove that the  contents as against premium at Rs.  134/- as  unlimited personal Injury and damages  to  be  Rs,  10 lakhs  has  been  wrongly  or misakenly shown in that.  policy,"" This finding is recorded in view of the stand taken by the  insurance  company before the TriaJ Court, namely,  the recording  of  the  words ""unlimited  personal  injury’  was wrongly  recorded therein.

" J U D G M E N T [with SLP(Civil) No. 6229/2006 & CA No. 7234/2003] MARKANDEY KATJU, J. CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7232 OF 2003 1.      This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Gauhati High Court dated 16.9.2002 in W.P. No.7598 of 2001. 2.      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 3.      In brief the claim of the respondents herein who were Senior Auditors in the office of the Accountant General, Assam and Meghalaya, was to be given parity in pay scale with Assistants in the Central Secretariat.  This claim was decreed by the Central Administrative Tribunal vide its order dated 19.1.2001 and the order of the Tribunal was upheld by the Gauhati High Court.  Hence this appeal. 4.      This Court in S.C. Chandra and Ors.  vs.  State of Jharkhand and Ors. JT 2007(10)4 SC 272 has held that the Court cannot fix pay scales as that is the purely executive function.  In the aforesaid decision one of us (Markandey Katju, J.) has discussed in detail the principle of equal pay for equal work and has observed that the said principle has been considerably watered down in recent decisions of this Court, and it is not applied unless there is a complete and wholesale identity between the two groups, and even there the matter should be sent for examination by an Expert Committee appointed by the Government instead of the Court itself granting the higher pay scale.  The entire case law on the subject has been discussed in the said decision.  Following the aforesaid decision in S.C. Chandra\022s case (Supra) this appeal has to be allowed.  It cannot be said that there is a complete and wholesale identity between the Senior Auditors in the office of Accountant General, Assam and Meghalaya and Assistants in the Central Secretariat. 5.      Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the auditors and assistants have been historically treated at par in the matter of pay scales.  Although this fact has been denied by the appellant, we are of the opinion that even if it is correct, that will not be of any help to the respondents.  To give an illustration, if post A and post B have been carrying the same pay scales, merely because the pay scale of post A has been increased that by itself cannot result in increase in the pay scale of Post B to the same level.  It is entirely on the Government and the authorities to fix the pay scales and to decide whether the pay scale of post B should be increased or not. The judiciary must exercise self restraint and not encroach into the executive or legislative domain. 6.      In view of the above, and following decision of this Court in S.C. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Chandra\022s case, the impugned judgment of the Gauhati High Court dated 16.9.2002 and of the Tribunal dated 19.1.2001 are set aside.

Appeal  bv Special Leave from the Judgment. and Order  dated 20-4-1976  of the Madras High Court in Criminal  Appeal  No. 708/75 and Referred Trial No. 39/75. V.   Mayakrishnan, amicus curiae for the Appellant. A.   V. Rangam for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 KRISHNA  IYER, J.-A toddy taper, young in age and  a  mental case,  returning after a day-long toil  with his  tool,  the sickle, and tense in state, was provoked by some trivias and went into tantrums and inflicted triple killings, all in one sombre sunset.  This bleeding tragedy led to prosecution and conviction,  appeal  and  confirmation,  the   unimpeachable offence being murder.  The defence of insanity tested by the hoary rule in McNaghten’s case, codified in the Indian Penal Code  over  hundred years ago, was  rightly  dismissed,  the testimony of dementia falling far short of the  prescription in  section  84 I.P.C. We have discovered no  error  in  the factual  finding and must therefore confirm the  conviction. Indeed, leave itself was granted confined to the question of sentence. 271 The  trial  Judge,  whose horror at  the  multiple  homicide unsheathed  the  terror of death  penalty,  decreed  capital sentence  on  the  culprit,  and  the  High  Court,   deeply disturbed  by  ""the brutal triple murder"", set its  seal  of approval on guilt and punishment. In the agonisingly sensitive area of sentencing,  especially in  the choice between life term and death penalty,  a  wide spectrum of circumstances attracts judicial attention, since they are all inarticulately implied in the penological  part of s. 302 I.P.C. read with s. 354(3) Cr. P.C. The  plurality of  factors bearing on the crime and the doer of  the  crime must  carefully  enter the judicial verdict.  The  winds  of penological  reform notwithstanding, the prescription in  s. 302  binds  and death penalty is still  permissible  in  the punitive  pharmacopoeia of India.  Even so, the  current  of precedents  and  the  relevant  catena  of  clement   facts, personal,  social and other, persuade us to hold that,  even as in Nanu Ram v. State of Assam (A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 762), the lesser   penalty  of  life  imprisonment  win  be   a   more appropriate punishment here. We  set aside the death sentence and award imprisonment  for life  to  the appellant under s. 302 I.P.C.  The  appeal  is disposed of accordingly. S.R.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This is  an appeal  against the  order of the Karnataka Administrative  Tribunal   [the   Tribunal]   at   Bangalore whereunder the respondent seemingly was absolved from facing a departmental  enquiry on the charge of having contracted a second marriage in the presence of the one subsisting with his acknowledged  wife and, as a result of which, the orders of suspension  passed against  the  respondent  were  lifted conferring  consequential  benefits.  It  appears  from  the record  that  the  respondent,  a  Police  Constable,  faced prosecution at the instance of his wife, before the criminal court and  was discharged  for want  of evidence  of the 2nd marriage. On the hand, a departmental enquiry was instituted against the respondent for which, priorly, he was suspended. He, in  turn, approached the Tribunal for the twin relief of (i) lifting  the suspension  order  and  (ii)  to  stop  the enquiry on  the  ground  that  the  criminal  court  had  on 14.1.1988 discharged  him of  the offence  of bigamy.  These pleas found  favour with  the Tribunal and, resultantly, the departmental proceedings  were quashed  and the  suspensions lifted. When this  matter was  brought to  this court,  it  was pleaded that  the said  order of  the criminal  court, dated 14.1.1988 had  been subjected  to  revision  and  there  was likelihood of  the view  of the  Magistrate being  reversed. Now, it transpires that the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge concerned wide order dated 11.9.1990, has affirmed the view of  the Trial  Magistrate  with  the  result  that  the respondent remains  discharged. This  apparently is  on  the basis that  strict proof  of  solemnisation  of  the  second marriage must  be proved  before conviction  can be recorded for such  offence. There  is a  string of  judgments of this Court whereunder strict proof of solemnisation of the second marriage, with due observance of rituals and ceremonies, has been insisted upon. The prosecution evidence in the criminal complaint may  have fallen short of those standards but that does not  mean that  the State  was in any way debarred form invoking Rule 28 of the Karnataka Civil Service Rules, which forbids a  Government servant to marry a second time without http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the permission  of the Government. But, here, the respondent being a  Hindu, could  never have been granted permission by the Government  to  marry  a  second  time  because  of  his personal law  forbidding such  marriage. It  was thus beyond the ken  of the  Tribunal to  have scuttled the departmental proceedings against  the respondent on the footing that such question of  bigamy should  normally not  be  taken  up  for decision in  departmental enquiries.  as  the  decisions  of competent courts  tending to be decisions in rem would stand at the  highest pedestal.  There was a clear fallacy in such view because for purposes of Rule 28, such strict standards, as would  warrant a  conviction for bigamy under Section 494 IPC, may  not, to  begin with,  be necessary.  We  therefore explain away  the orders of the Tribunal to the afore extent that Rule  28 can  be invoked,  but would certainly maintain the orders of revocation of suspension since in the presence of the  orders of discharge in favour of the respondent, his continued  suspension   during  the   enquiry  was   totally unwarranted. Let the enquiry be held. There is thus partial success for both the parties. The appeal  stands   ordered   with   these   observations   and directions.","Police Constable faced prosecution at the instance of his wife.

" O R D E R Though notice  has been sent on second occasion to respondent No.3 on May 24, 1994, so far acknowledgement has not  come back. Therefore, notice on 3rd respondent must be  deemed to  have been served. Respondents 1 & 2 are represented by Mr. G.S. Chatterjee. Leave granted. The respondents  filed Suit  No.19/75 on  May  19, 1975 for  eviction of the tenant Harkesh Rai Agarwal on three  grounds,   namely,  default,   sub-letting   and personal requirement.  The suit was dismissed on August 25,  1975.   Again  another   suit  was  instituted  on September 25,  1975 for  the same grounds. The suit was again dismissed.  Pending appeal,  Harkesh Rai  and the respondent have  compromised the  matter. By compromise decree dated  November 26,  1981, Harkesh Rai agreed to surrender one  room now in possession of the appellant. When execution was sought to be taken and the appellant resisted the  execution, an  application under Order 21 Rule 97  of CPC  was filed  to remove  the  obstruction which was  ordered by  the Executing  Court. On appeal, the High  Court by  order  dated  August  16,  1983  in F.A.1/91 dismissed  the appeal.  Thus  this  appeal  by special leave. The question is: whether the appellant is bound by the   compromise decree  entered into  by  Harkesh  Rai Agarwal and  the respondents.  It is  settled law  that unless the  conditions for  eviction  are  proved,  the decree for  eviction on  compromise is  a nullity. That apart, the  property belongs  to four persons and three brothers made  an admission prior to partition that the appellant is  in possession of a room admeasuring 15’ x 30’ as  tenant and  admittedly it  fell to the share of Lunkaran Singhi.  In view  of those  admissions made by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the co-owners  who have  got joint  interest  and  made their admissions against their interest, the admissions bind all  the co-owners. In view of that admission, the necessary conclusion  is this  that  the  appellant  is independently in possession of the premises admeasuring 15’ x 30’ in his own right as a tenant. In the  compromise decree,  ultimately, the   High Court granted possession of the premises in  occupation of the  appellant. The  appellant having been  found in possession,  he   is  entitled  to  obstruct  execution defending his  his illegal  dispossession in  execution proceedings and  he is  also independently  entitled to file application  under Order  21 Rule 97  claiming his possession. In view of the fact that he was found to be in possession,  the finding  recorded by  the Executing Court as  upheld by  the High  Court  that  he    is  a licensee on  behalf of  Harkesh Rai Agarwal is  clearly illegal. We, therefore, hold that the  appellant cannot be ejected  from the  premises in his possession except in accordance with law. As regards the execution of the compromise decree is concerned, it would be open to the respondent to  proceed against  Harkesh Rai  Agarwal in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","The respondents  filed Suit  No.19/75 on  May  19, 1975 for eviction of the tenant Harkesh Rai Agarwal. The suit was dismissed on August 25,  1975.

This   appeal   by special  leave  from the judgment of the Punjab   7 Haryana High Court, made on October  15, 1996 in CWP No. 12474/95. The admitted  facts are  that  in June 1980 there was a requisition   in the  Irrigation  Department for filling  up of four vacancies of sub-Divisional Clerks.  The Subordinate service selection  Board advertised  the posts.  Instead  of selecting   four candidates  , it  prepared  a  list  of  28 candidates  in   November  1982  and  recommended  them  for appointment Eight  candidates  including the respondent were recommended  for   appointment  in   Hathnikund  Procurement Circle.

It would  appear that  the respondent  has been  making application   to various  authorities from time  to time but the same   failed to bear any fruit.  As a consequence, writ petition came    so  be  filed  in  October    1996  seeking issuance of  writ write  of mandamus  for appointment to the post of  Sub-Divisional Clerk.

" JUDGMENT ORDER CIVIL  APPEAL NO.1576 /2008 (@SLP(C) No.7917 /2006) Leave granted. Respondent was an employee of the appellant. He was transferred to Pilibhit by an order dated 16.10.1998. He did not join the said transferred post. He was placed under suspension by an order dated 16.11.1998. A departmental proceeding was initiated against him. A large number of charges including defalcation were framed in the departmental proceeding. Attempts after attempts were made to serve the charge-sheet on him i.e. on 2.2.2001, 7.3.2001, 19.4.2001 and 28.8.2001. Even the contents of the said charge-sheet were published in the newspaper. He did not file any show-cause. The inquiry officer submitted a report thereafter. Again a second show-cause notice was issued on 18.8.2001. He even did not reply thereto. Respondent, however, filed a writ petition before the Allahabad High Court. The High Court by reason of the impugned judgment holding that the inquiry proceeding was vitiated in law as the inquiry officer did not apply his mind -1- on the materials produced before him directed his reinstatement without back wages. Mr.Jain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit that keeping in view the fact that the respondent had not appeared before the inquiry officer nor filed any show-cause, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. Mr. Mohanty, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand would support the impugned judgment. The High Court, even if it was correct in its view on the merit of the matter, in our opinion, could not have directed  reinstatement of the respondent. Even if decisions in Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad and Ors. Vs. B. Karunakar & Ors. - (1993) 4 SCC 727 and in U.P. State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. Vs. Chandra Bhan Dubey and Ors.-  1991 1 SCC 741 were to be applied, the order of reinstatement could not have been passed. Mr. Jain, learned counsel relies on a decision of this Court in Deputy Registrar Coop. Societies and Other Vs.Bunni Lal Chaurasia - 2005 11 SCC 570, where principles of natural justice were held to be not applicable having regard to the fact that despite service of notice, the respondent did not appear. The said decision is not applicable in the instant case as from a perusal of the report submitted by the -2- inquiry officer it is evident that he had proceeded solely on the basis that as no reply has been filed by the delinquent officer, the charges must be held to have been proved. A distinction exits between a case where the delinquent officer admits his guilt and a case where he absents himself in the proceeding. In the latter event, even if http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 he is proceeded against ex-parte evidence has to be led as the enquiry officer is required to apply his mind on the materials brought on record. In his report the inquiry officer has not referred to any document placed before him. Who produced the said document is not known. How the said documents could be used against the respondent was not deliberated upon. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the interest of justice would be subserved if the matter is remitted to the inquiry officer to hold a denovo enquiry against the respondent. However, keeping in view the  conduct of the respondent in so far as he had been avoiding the disciplinary proceeding from 1998 till date as also in view of the report,we direct that the  respondent shall  not be entitled to any subsistence allowance for the said period. Respondent shall report before the Managing Director of the appellant on 29.3.2008. The Disciplinary Authority  shall immediately appoint another inquiry officer.

Only to  that extent subject to any further condition  may be  imposed, the injunction  may be  vacated  or suitably  modified,   We   do   not propose to go into at this stage on this limited issue."" Pursuant thereto,  a counter-affidavit has been file by the respondent  stating  that  the  appellant  has  obtained plantations of  the cardamom. He disbanded the entire labour force.  Only   tow  persons   are  kept  in  charge  of  the plantations and,  therefore, there  is to  need to  cut  and remove any  trees. Shri  Subba Rao,  learned counsel for the appellant has stated that the appellant has been carrying on the planting  of  cardamom.  The  trees  that  obstruct  the cardamom cultivation  are required to be cut: similarly, the trees suffer  afflicted wi  diseases have to be cut so as to keep infection  free atmosphere,  Under those circumstances, it is  necessary that  he may be permitted to cut the trees. Shri Vishwanantha  Iyer,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the respondent, States  that since  the cardamom plantations are required to be done only in the monsoon season, i.e., June , July or March and April and the first season is yet to start http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and since  there are,  at present, no crops there is no need to cut  the trees.  In view  of the allegations and counter- allegations, we  cannot set  the matter  at rest here. Under these circumstances,  the trial Court is directed to appoint an advocate Commissioner to make a personal inspection after notice to  the parties  and to  submit a  report whether the cardamom plantations  have been  raised by the appellant and if so  in what  extent of the land the plantations have been raised. On  the receipt  of the report from the Commissioner with a  finding that  cardamom plantations have been raised, necessary directions  should be issued to cut such number of trees  which   require  for   uninterrupted  cultivation  of cardamom plantations  and also  such of the plants which are affected by  pests so  as to  keep the plantations free from infection. The  petitioner is required to obtain crop loans. He could also obtain crop loan from the banks etc. The trial Court is directed to dispose of the suit by December 1996.

" O R D E R Heard counsel for the appellant. Pursuant to notice issued on November 22, 1988, Mr. Uma Dutta had  appeared for  the  respondent.  Subsequently,  he reported on  January 6,  1995 that  he was instructed not to appear  in  the  matter.  He  sought  for  and  was  granted permission to  withdraw  from  the  case.  Thereafter,  none appeared  for   the  respondent.  Initially,  the  case  was adjourned   since   consequent   upon   reference   doubting correctness of  Mithilesh Kumar  & Anr. v. Prem Behari Khare [(1989) 2  SCC 95]  decision  by  a  three-Judge  Bench  was awaited. The  controversy is no longer res judicata. In view of the  judgment of three-Judge Bench in R. Rajagopala Reddy v. Padmini  Chandrashekharan [(1995)  2 SCC 630], wherein it was held  that the  Benami Transaction  Prohibition  Act  is prospective in  operation, the  question in  this  case  is: whether the  sale of the appellant’s land to the wife of the second respondent,  Ram Mehrar,  holder of power of attorney of the appellant is valid in law? It is  seen  that  Ram  Mehrar  had  general  power  of attorney not only to engage a counsel and conduct litigation on behalf  of the appellant, but can also mortgage, alienate or transfer  possession of  the agricultural  land to anyone whosoever after obtaining the exemption from the appropriate authorities. It is seen that notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act acquiring the land was published in January  1979.  Notice,  thereafter,  was  given  to  the appellant on  March 28,  1979. When  the appellant  demanded from the  second respondent in August 1979 the return of her Power of  Attorney, he did not return it. On the other hand, he promised  that  he  would  not  act  detrimental  to  her interest. The  second respondet appears to have field a suit on August  23, 1979  in which  he impleaded the appellant as party-defendant. It  is the  case of  the appellant that the second respondent engaged two advocates, one Mr. Mitter Sain on behalf of himself and other Ram Kishan for the appellant. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The counsel  appearing for  her informed  her  had  produced damage to  the  appellant  depriving  her  of  the  valuable property  denuding   right,  title  and  interest  to  claim compensation  in  respect  of  her  lands  acquired  by  the Government. Having been defrauded, she is entitled to lay to suit for declaration of title and other reliefs in the suit. It would,  therefore, be a clear case of fraud played by the respondent upon  the  appellant.  The  fraud  unreveals  the contract and  it is  void. The  courts below  have committed grave error  by not  appreciating the  fraud played  by  the respondent in proper perspective. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  judgments and decrees  of   the  courts   below  are  set  aside.  In  the circumstances, the  suit is  decreed  with  exemplary  costs throughout quantified  at Rs. 10,000/- at each of the stages including in this Court.","Ram Mehrar, wife of the second respondent,  holder of power of attorney of the appellant is valid in law.

Notice was issued on the appeal leave petitions on 10.7.2001. The respondents filed IAs. for revoking the notice on the allegation that correct facts were not brought to the notice of the Court. Heard the learned counsel for the parties. We are not inclined to consider these special leave petitions on merits for two reasons; first, notice was ordered on the basis, gathered from the documents filed in the special leave petitions, that the impugned order was passed on 12.1.2001; if that were to be correct there was no dealy in filing the special petitions and it was accordingly so observed. Now, it turns out that the impugned order was passed on 12.1.2000 and not on 12.1.2001 and on the material on record we are satisfied that it is not a case of typographical error. Thus, there is a delay of more than a year which remains unexplained and, therefore, the special leave petitions cannot be entertained. Secondly, the impugned order is only an interlocutory order and the Writ Petition is still pending. This Court will not normally execrise its jursidiction under Article 136 of the Constitution in respect of an interlocutory order except in special circumstances to prevent manifest injustice or abuse of the process of the Court. We do not find any special circumstances warranting our intereferece in this case.

A short question which arises for determination in this civil appeal instituted by the appellants-tenants is whether the Additional District and Sessions Judge was justified in fixing provisional rent at Rs. 1 lac per month from Rs. 500/- per month fixed in the earlier round of litigation by the Civil Judge (Jr. Div.). Having heard learned counsel for both sides, since the impugned order is an interim order in civil suit No. 61/2002 pending before A.D.J. No. 6, Jaipur, this appeal stands disposed of in terms of the following order: (i)     Pending the hearing and final disposal of civil suit No. 61/2002, the appellants-tenants shall pay to its landlord (respondent herein), without prejudice to its rights and contentions, ad hoc rent @ Rs. 60,000/- per month. The said rent shall be paid on or before tenth of each month commencing from the month of December, 2007. The said rent is fixed without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in the above pending civil suit No. 61/2002. At the interim stage, this Court had called for valuation report. Both sides submitted valuation reports. Taking into account the contents of the valuation reports and the location of the premises, we have fixed the ad hoc rent at Rs. 60,000/- per month, pending the hearing and final disposal of the said civil suit No. 61/2002. It would be open to the civil court to examine the evidence and refix the provisional rent in accordance with law.

(ii)    In the said civil suit No. 61/2002, an application was made by the appellants-tenants under Order XIV Rule 5 CPC. The said application shall also be decided by the civil court in accordance with law. (iii)   Since the disputes are pending for last several years we direct the civil court to expeditiously hear and dispose of the said civil suit No. 61/2002, preferably within nine months from today. It is made clear that the parties shall not seek adjournment. Accordingly, the impugned order passed by the High Court shall stand modified to the extent hereinabove mentioned.

" THE 26TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.T.Nanavati Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kirpal Ms, Suresh Kumari and S.K.Sabbarwal, Advs. for the appellant Kuldip Singh and R.S.Sodhi, Advs. for the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgement of the Court was delivered: NANAVATI, J. The  appellant   has  filed  this  appeal  against  the judgment and  order of  the Add1.  Judge, Designated  court, Sangrur in Special Sessions Case No. 84 of 1989. During the  nakabandi,  police  noticed  the  appellant moving in suspicious circumstances. One personal search, the appellant was found carrying one .32 bore revolver which was in working  order.  It  was  found  loaded  with  one  empty cartridge and  five  live  cartridges.  He  was,  therefore, prosecuted for  the offence  punishable under  Section 25 of the Arms Act read with Section 5 of the TADA Act. In order  to prove  its  case,  case,  the  prosecution examined the Investigating Officer - Joginder Singh, who was then an  Inspector of  Police and  PW.2 - Karnail Singh, who was one  of the  recovery witnesses.  Joginder Singh  in his evidence stated  that the  said revolver  was found from the person of  the appellant  and on examination it was found in working order.  He also  deposed that an attempt was made to procure attendance  of two independent witnesses at the time of search  and seizure  but they  were not  available. He is fully supported by the evidence of PW.2 - Karnail Singh. We do  not find  any infirmity in their evidence. It is difficult to  believe that  the police  could have planted a revolver, as  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant. We have also no reason to doubt competence of the Investigation Officer  to depose  about the condition of the revolver. In our  opinion, the  trial court rightly convicted the appellant under Section 25 of the Arms Act read with Section 5 of  the TADA  Act. The sentence imposed upon the appellant also appears to us reasonable.

" O R D E R The appellant  is the  daugher-in-law of  the  deceased Gomathi Ammal.  Venkatarama  Iyengar,  the  husband  of  the appellant was the only son of Gomathi Ammal  and her husband Sesha Iyengar. He died  prior to the death of Gomathi Ammal. Venkatarama Iyengar  and the appellant have no children. The husband of  Gomathi Ammal also died long prior to her death. The appellant  filed a suit for declaration of ownership and possession of  properties left  by Gomathi  Ammal  who  died intestate. The respondent, claiming to be the son of Gomathi Ammal’s brother,  contested the  suit  on  the  ground  that Gomathi Ammal made a will in his favour. The will  has not  been accepted  either by  the  trial Court or  by the  first appellate Court or by the High Court in second  appeal. The  only reason  why the  High Court has allowed  the  second  appeal  is  on  the  ground  that  the appellant is  not an  heir of  her mother-in-law  under  the Hindu Succession Act. This  finding   proceeds  on  a  misconception  of  the provisions of  the Hindu  Succession act.  Section 15 of the Hindu Succession act provides general rules of succession in the case  of  female  Hindus.  Under  sub-section  (1),  the property of a Hindu female dying intestate shall devolve (a) firstly, upon  the sons and daughters(including the children of any  pre-deceased son  or daughter)  and the husband; (b) secondly, upon  the heirs of the husband. Gomathi Ammal does not have  any heirs falling under (a). Therefore, we have to examine who  are the  heirs of  her husband.  The heirs of a male Hindu  are  set  out  in  the  Schedule  to  the  Hindu Succession Act.  Heirs in  class I include a widow of a pre- deceased son.  The appellant  fits this description. But the High Court  has held that when Sesha Iyengar, the husband of Gomathi Ammal died, their son Venkatarama Iyengar was alive. So the  appellant cannot  be called  the  widow  of  a  pre- deceased son. In order  to decide who are the heirs of a female Hindu under category (b) of Section 15(10, one does not have to go back to  the date  of the  death of the husband to ascertain who were  his heirs  at that  time. The  heirs  have  to  be ascertained not  at the  time of  the husband’s death but at http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the time  of the  wife’s death  because the succession opens only at the time of her death. Her heirs under Section 15(1) (b) will  have to be ascertained as if the succession to her husband had opened at the time of her death. Thus, if at the time of  Gomathi Ammal’s  death, there  is any  heir of  her husband who  fits the  description in  the schedule of being the widow  of his  pre-deceased son,  she will be one of the heirs entitled  to succeed.  The status  of the heir must be determined at  the time  of the  death of  the female  whose heirs are  being ascertained. The appellant was the widow of a pre-deceased  son on  the date  when Gomathi  Ammal  died. Therefore, the  learned single Judge was not right in coming to the  conclusion that  the appellant  is not  an  heir  of Gomathi Ammal. The appeal  is, therefore,  allowed. the impugned order of the  High Court  is set  aside and  the suit filed by the plaintiff is decreed with costs.","The appellant is the daugher-in-law of the deceased Gomathi Ammal.

" JUDGMENT S.B. SINHA, J. : 1. The Respondents herein were appointed by the appellant-Corporation as Security Guards. Different regions have been created by the Corporation for managing its affairs. The divisions of Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Warangal and Khammam formed part of one region known as ‘Karimnagar Region of Kakatiya’ in the appellant-Corporation. The Warangal region, however, was carved out therefrom known as ‘Warangal Region’. The respondents herein had been working at Warangal. When an option was called for in regard to their posting in the Warangal region and Karimnagar region, they opted for the former region. They were, therefore, absorbed in the Warangal region of the appellant-Corporation. 2. It is stated that subsequently some posts were created in the Karimnagar region. One Mr. T.J. Reddy, who was junior to the respondents in the combined seniority list was promoted to the post of Security Head Guard as he became the senior most in the Karimnagar region. 3. A writ petition was filed by the respondents herein for consideration of their cases for promotion. An interim order was passed by the learned Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court directing the appellant- Corporation to consider their cases. Aggrieved thereby, an appeal was preferred before the Division Bench. The Division Bench, however, although initially suspended the operation of the said interim order passed by the learned Single Judge, thought it fit and expedient to withdraw the writ petition itself before it and determine the same on its own merits. By reason of the impugned judgment, the writ petition had been allowed directing the appellant-Corporation to consider the cases of the respondents for promotion from the post of Security Guard to Security Head Guard from the date on which their junior had been promoted. 4. The bifurcation of the division is not in dispute. Warangal division, thus, became a new division. It has also not been disputed that cadre of the employees is maintained region-wise. Therefore, separate seniority lists were required to be maintained only on that basis. Once there has been a valid division of two regions as a result of which a new region came into being, a distinct and separate seniority list of the employees was required to be maintained. If the respondents had opted for remaining in the cadre of the employees of the Warangal region, in our opinion, only because a vacancy had fallen in the Karimnagar region and the same had been filled up from amongst the employees thereof, no exception thereto could be taken. The Division Bench of the High Court, in our opinion, did not consider this aspect of the matter. The Division Bench proceeded on the basis that as the respondents might be otherwise qualified, they were entitled to be considered for promotion opining that respondents are and should not be deprived from being considered therefor when their juniors have been promoted. In our opinion, the Division Bench committed a manifest http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 error in coming to the aforementioned conclusion inasmuch as there having been a valid division of the cadre, the question of the respondents becoming senior to the said Mr. T.J. Reddy in the Karimnagar Region did not and could not arise as a new seniority list came into being. 5. The impugned judgment, for the reason aforementioned, is set aside and the appeal is allowed. As none appears for the respondents, there shall be no order as to costs.","The respondents herein had been working at Warangal.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. Heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Division  Bench of  the High  Court of  Punjab & Haryana made on  July 14,  1995 in  writ  petition  No.3200/95.  The admitted position  is that  on August  8, 1971,  the Haryana Subordinate Service Selection Board advertised for selection of the candidates for Family Welfare Extension Educators and Family Planning  Welfare Educators  in the Health Department of the  State of  Haryana. On  June 7,  1972, a  list of  45 candidates was  prepared on  the basis  of merit  secured by them  in   the  selection.  It  would  appear  that  ad  hoc appointees  approached   the  High   Court  and  filed  W.P. No.2122/72 and  obtained status  quo on  June 13,  1972. The writ petition  came to  be disposed of on November 20, 1981. Thereafter, the  letters of  appointment were  given to  the selected candidates  and the candidates came to be appointed and joined  duties on  various dates  between September  30, 1985 and  December 23,  1586. The gradation of seniority was done  in   1994.  The  seniority  of  respondents  has  been determined with effect from their dates of actual joining in 1985-86. As  said earlier,  the High  Court allowed the writ petition and  declared them  to be seniors on par with those who were  selected and  whom  letters  of  appointment  were offered in 1972. The question,  therefore, is:  whether the  respondents are entitled  to seniority  from 7th  June, 1972  as per the gradation list  prepared by  the Selection  Board? Normally, the seniority  of the  candidates who  are selected  by  the direct recruitment would be determined with reference to the merit  list   prepared  by   the   Selection   Board.   But, unfortunately, in this case, they could not join the service due to  the pendency  of the  writ petition. The respondents themselves have  to be  blamed for the laches since they did http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 not take  any action,  namely, impleading  themselves in the pending  writ   petition  nor  filed  any  independent  writ petition claiming for their appointment. After the dismissal of the  writ petition,  letters of  appointment came  to  be issued in  1985 and  they joined  the service. It is settled law that  the seniority of the candidates has to be reckoned from the  date on  which they joined the service and started discharging the  duties of the post to which they came to be appointed. In  that view,  since the  respondents joined the service  in   1985-86,  seniority   cannot  be   given  with retrospective effect  from the  date of the selection to the candidates appointed  from the list of merit prepared by the Selection Board. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","The appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the Division  Bench of the High  Court of  Punjab & Haryana made on July 14, 1995 in writ  petition  No.3200/95.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the learned single Judge made in Civil Revision No.209/94 on 16.11.1994 of  the High  Court of Rajasthan. Admittedly, the respondent-Company after  inviting tenders  had executed  an agreement  on   13.4.1969  for  execution  of  the  project. Thereafter, three  post-dated cheques  of dates  between May and July  1989 were given for a sum of Rs.6,87,100/- each of which got bounced. After issuing said notice, the suits were filed  for   recovery.  Simultaneously,   proceedings   were initiated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act and also  under Section  420 IPC  in  three  complaints,  CC Nos.219, 220  and 254  of 1989.  The High  Court stayed  the proceedings of  the civil  suits  pending  disposal  of  the criminal cases.  This appeal  came to  be filed  against the said order. It is settled law that pendency of the criminal matters would not  be an impediment to proceed with the civil suits. The criminal  court would deal with offence punishable under the Act.  On the  other hand,  the courts  rarely  stay  the criminal cases  and only  when the  compelling circumstances require the  exercise of  power. We  have never  come across stay of any civil suits by the courts so far. The High Court of Rajasthan  is only  an exception to pass such orders. The High Court proceeded on wrong premise that the accused would be expected  to disclose  their defence in the criminal case by asking  them to proceed with the trial of the suit. It is not a  correct principle  of law.  Even otherwise  it longer subsists, since  many of  them have  filed their defences in the civil  suit. On  principle of  law,  we  hold  that  the approach adopted by the High Court is not correct. But since the defence  has already been filed nothing survives in this matter. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 High Court is set aside. No costs.","Company after inviting tenders had executed an agreement on   13.4.1969 for the execution of the project.

" JUDGMENT 2002 (3) SCR 911 The following Order of the Court was delivered : This is a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, seeking leave to file civil appeal against an appellate order of City Civil Court No. 11 Ahmedabad, ’passed under sub-Section (2) of Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. We are not inclined to entertain this special leave petition inasmuch as, in our opinion, an efficacious alternate remedy is available to the petitioner by way of filing a revision in the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Merely because a second appeal against an appellate order is barred by the provisions of sub-Section (3) of Section 37, the remedy of revision does not cease to be available to the petitioner, for the City Civil Court deciding an appeal under sub-Section (2) of Section 37 remains a court subordinate to the High Court within the meaning of Section 115 of the C.P.C. In taking this view, we find support from a decision of this Court in Shyam Sunder Agarwal and Co. v. Union of India, [1996] 2 SCC 132. The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed. The petitioner may file a revision before the High Court and in calculating the limitation, the petitioner shall be entitled to exclusion of time spent in this Court, i.e., between the date of filing of the special leave petition and today.","The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.

" J  U  D G  M  E  N  T RAJENDRA BABU,  J.  : The respondents brought a suit on the original side of the Bombay High Court for recovery of certain sum of money against the petitioner and the Guarantor.  In respect of machinery which had been stated to have been financed by the respondent-Bank a Court Receiver was appointed and the respondents took out a Notice of Motion making several prayers, including one for sale of the suit machinery. The learned trial Judge refused the prayer for the same.  On appeal to the Division Bench, the same had been allowed subject to sanction of the court and with liberty to the petitioner to participate in the sale as and when it is held.  Pursuant to the order of sale, the respondents issued advertisement and also received offers for the same.  An application was made to the Division Bench seeking permission for sale of the suit machinery to the person having made the best offer which was at Rs. 1.26 crores.   However, subsequently, the petitioner offered a sum of Rs. 1.30 crores.  The Division Bench had refused to consider the said request.  Hence this petition. The Division Bench of the High Court is of the opinion that nothing had been done by the petitioner to take part in the sale as and when it was sought to be held and did not participate in the same. It was made clear in the advertisement that interested parties should apply within 15 days and, therefore,  the High Court is of the opinion that there was no bona fides on the part of the petitioner. Now, an attempt is sought to be made by the petitioner to participate in the sale proceedings by contending that it is at the stage of confirmation of sale that the petitioner’s request ought to be considered if it is the best offer available in the market and viable. This exercise appears to us to be only the after-thought and the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court does not call for any interference.  The High Court cannot be stated to have mis-understood its own order.  In the circumstances of the case,  we do not think that any interference is called for in the order made by the High Court.  The amounts of money deposited by the petitioner pursuant to order dated 3.5.2002 be refunded.  Subject as aforesaid, the petition stands dismissed.

" JUDGMENT ORDER TRANSFER PETITION(C) NO.262/2006 Petitioner is before us seeking transfer of a matrimonial proceeding initiated by the respondent for obtaining a decree for divorce against her being Suit No. 447/2006 pending before the Addl.District & Sessions Judge, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi to the Family Court at Giridih, Jharkhand. Petitioner is residing in village Pachamba, District-Giridih, Jharkhand. She states that it will be inconvenient for  her to attend the Court proceedings at Delhi. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondent wherein it is stated that as the petitioner did not appear in the proceedings, ex-pate evidence had been led  and the matter was to come up for final arguments on 20.5.2006. At that stage only this petition for transfer  was filed and stay of further proceedings was obtained. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner would urge that having regard to the wide discretionary power conferred upon this Court in terms of Section 25 of the Code Civil Procedure, this Court may transfer the aforementioned Suit No.477/2006 from Delhi to the Family Court at Giridih, Jharkhand. We have noticed hereinbefore that the matter has been heard ex- parte. It is only pending for advancing arguments and pronouncement of judgment. At this stage even a  petition for setting aside the ex-parte order would not be -1- maintainable in view of the decision of this Court in Arjun Singh Vs.Mohindra Kumar and Ors. - 1964 AIR (SC) 993. It is only when an ex-parte decree passed as against the petitioner, if any, is set aside the petitioner would be entitled to move an application for transfer. Our attention has been drawn to a decision of this Court in Usha Vs. Palisetty Mohan Rao -2002 (X) SCC 544 wherein an ex-parte decree had been passed. It appears that on an interlocutory application filed by the petitioner therein, the ex-parte decree had been set aside and it was in that context the application for transfer was allowed. Reliance has also been placed on Uma Parekh @ Uma Joshi @ Pinku Vs. Ajeet Pareek @ Govind Pareek and Ors. wherein Usha(supra) has been followed. We have our serious reservations about the correctness of the aforementioned decision as to whether even in exercise of discretionary power conferred under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this Court could have set aside an ex-parte decree passed by the trial Court in a proceeding under Article 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, particularly, in view of the fact that by reason thereof the valuable right of an appeal of an aggrieved party is thereby taken away. However, it is not necessary to go into the said question in this case, as no ex-parte decree has yet been passed. No application before this Court has also not been filed. For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in this http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 petition.

Later on at the instance of the landlord the leave was revoked and the petition was dismissed. 3.To overcome this hurdle the learned counsel has  placed reliance on Hari Singh v.

According to  him this  Court  committed  a  mistake  in  revoking  leave  and depriving  the  petitioner to avail  of  his  constitutional remedy.   Therefore, this Court is constitutionally  obliged to grant her protection. 4.Existence  of constitutional right cannot be  disputed.

In the subsequent order dated 21.7.1997, the petitioners were permitted to approach the NHRC with suggestions, for interim directions. NHRC evolved short term and long term schemes to empower the people of this region and also monitored implementation of such scheme for more than eight years. It submitted several interim reports to this Court. On 10.3.2003, this Court noted : ""It is brought to our notice that in the light of the progress made in the matter before the NHRC, the matter should continue to be considered by the NHRC itself and further orders are not required by this Court at this stage. It is ordered accordingly. The report filed so far shall, therefore, stand accepted."" Various recommendations made by the NHRC have empowered the people residing in the locality by providing them with land, irrigation facilities and opportunity to live with some dignity. The monitoring mechanism suggested by NHRC also ensured that the recommendations were implemented. Both the Union of India and the State Government co- operated well and with the joint efforts of all concerned, it is stated that a perceptible change has been brought about in the KBK area, which had earlier been termed as a problem beyond redemption. The final report with  appropriate recommendations has been given by NHRC on 30.8.2006. These recommendations will go a long way in improving the living conditions of KBK region. The recommendations in the final report of NHRC have been accepted by the State Government. The State Government has also agreed for an effective monitoring mechanism suggested by NHRC to ensure that the suggestions made by the NHRC are implemented properly and continuously. In the circumstances, we are of the view that no further directions are required in this petition and the connected transferred case.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the  Division  Bench  of  the  Bombay  High  Court  made  on September 7,  1983 in W.P. No.3038 of 1983. The appellant is a rival  trade union  under M/s. Chemicals & Fibers of India Ltd. [formerly  ICI India Ltd.]. The Industrial Court in the order had  pointed out  that the  total employees as on June 15, 1981 were 811 and the respondent-union had a strength of 448 as  against the appellant-rival union having strength of 241. Thus  it  was  held  to  be  a  recognized  union.  The appellant  had  challenged  the  procedure  adopted  by  the investigating officer under Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Union and  Prevention of Unfair Labour Practice Act, 1971 (1 of 1971) (for short, ’MRTUPULP Act’). Shri Kailash Vasdev, learned counsel for the appellant, contended that  the Investigating  Officer was not justified in law in conducting spot verification and calling employees either by  alternate number  and verifying the same and that the procedure,  therefore, was clearly illegal. It is not in dispute that  the investigation  requires to  be done by the investigating  officer  in  accordance  with  the  procedure prescribed under  the Act. This Court in Automobile Products of India  Employees’ Union  vs. Association  of  Engineering Workers Bombay,  [(1990) 2 SCC 444] had held that the scheme relating to  the recognition  was to  be done  in accordance with the  Act. Even if the parties consented to identify the number of  employees in  the Company  by secret ballot, that method was not warranted by law and consent did not cure the illegality of  substitution of  a procedure  not  prescribed under the Act. The same view was reiterated by this Court in Association of Engineering Workers vs. Dockyard Labour Union &  Ors.,   [(1995)  Supp.  4  SCC  544].  Consequently,  the investigating office is required to conduct investigation in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Act. In this  case, the  Industrial Court  had directed  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 investigating officer  by his  order dated November 17, 1980 to give  opportunity to  the parties and then to conduct the enquiry in  terms of  its previous  order dated  October  5, 1979. In  furtherance  thereof,  the  investigating  officer called upon the appellant as well as the respondent-Union to submit the  list of  members of the respective associations. He initially had verified the lists and thereafter made spot verification that  the basis.  He submitted a report stating that ""as  per the  direction given  by the  Hon’ble  Member, Industrial Court,  the undersigned  conducted the enquiry on the spot  in the presence of the two representatives of each union and  members of  the non-application  employees."" This report of the total number of respective unions was accepted by the  Industrial Court  and upheld  no doubt not by a very reasoned order, by the summary order. The Division Bench did not interfere  after perusal  of records,  since no error of law would be noticed. Hence this appeal. Under Section  14 of the Act, the prohibition to make a fresh application  was imposed  for a  period of  two years; further making  of an  application within  one year from the date of order passed by the Industrial Court was prohibited. In other  words, after the expiry of two years, if any rival union  seeks   any  recognition,  the  Industrial  Court  is required to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 14 of the  act and  then to  take a  decision according to law. Since the  order was  passed by  the Industrial Court in the year 1983  and sufficient  time  has  already  elapsed,  the embargo under  Section 14 of the Act no longer is available. Therefore, if  the appellant  still seeks any recognition of the appellant-Union in accordance with the provisions of the Act, it  would  be  open  to  adopt  such  procedure  as  is available under law. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","Appellant is a rival trade union under M/s. Chemicals & Fibers of India Ltd.

In the present appeal, an order passed by the High Court of Madya Pradesh at Jabalpur dated March 7, 2005 in Miscellaneous Criminal P. No.1567 of 2005, is challenged.

It was stated that though the High Court had passed the above order, no notice was issued,  no opportunity of being heard was afforded to the appellant herein and the order was passed without hearing her.

The  admitted position is that  the   petitioner  after  his  promotion  as  Assistant Engineer in  Telecom Engineering  Service Group ’B’ on April 16,  1979   was  kept   under  suspension  and  disciplinary proceedings were  initiated against  him. On  June 30, 1986, punishment was  imposed by way of compulsory retirement. The same came  to be  challenged by way of an appeal. On appeal, the Department  directed  that  the  punishment  be  treated partly as suspension and partly as in service by proceedings dated February  16, 1979. When the petitioner challenged the same in  O.A. No. 1690/90, by order dated February 14, 1992, the same was allowed and direction was given to treat him as on duty for all purposes including pay and allowances. After reinstatement,  the   petitioner  retired  from  service  on attaining superannuation  on May  31, 1992.  He had prior to that filed  representation for  crossing his efficiency bar. In the impugned order, the Tribunal has held that the D.P.C. had considered his case for efficiency bar and found him not fit and,  therefore, he is not entitled to the relief. Thus, this special leave petition. It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the petitioner that  when he  was reinstated  into  service  the efficiency bar  was required  to be  considered after taking into account  his subsequent  record. What  was  stated  was adverse entries  for the  year  1979-80,  1980-81,  1981-82. There was  no reconsideration  in the light of the direction issued by  the Ministry  in the  letter dated  September 18, 1991 in O.M. No. 7(28)/EIII/91 that all pending cases should be considered  to bring  them on  par with  the scale of pay recommended by  the 4th  Pay Commission,  the petitioner had given a representation but the same was not considered; even direction given  to produce  the record  was  not  followed. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Therefore, the  Tribunal ought to have drawn adverse entries and directed  that the  petitioner was entitled to cross the efficiency bar  and he  also  contended  that  sealed  cover procedure as  is  invoked  that  direction  should  also  be considered for  the crossing  of the efficiency bar and kept pending when  the departmental  enquiry was  pending against him. We find  no force in the contention. The petitioner has not brought  to  our  notice  any  circular  issued  by  the Government and  it is  obviously incongruous  for the reason that in  event of  the petitioners  disciplinary proceedings becoming  final,  the  exercise  to  consider  the  question crossing efficacy  bar  would  be  fruitless.  It  would  be unnecessary to  consider the  case for  efficiency  bar.  It would be  only in  the event  of his being reinstated in the service that  the question  of consideration of his crossing efficiency bar  would arise.  Therefore,  the  sealed  cover procedure in  consideration of question of efficacy bar does not apply. It is seen that after the representation was made by the  petitioner on  June 8, 1990, the matter was referred for consideration  by the  D.P.C. D.P.C.  had met on January 21, 1992  and considered the record of the petitioner. After reinstatement, he  had hardly  worked for  three months.  It would appear  that for  three successive  years, there  were adverse entries against the petitioner. Consequently, DPC as considering  the   record  of   the  petitioner   which  was available, recommended that he was unfit to cross efficiency bar. The  same came  to be  informed to  the petitioner vide letter  dated  February  7,  1992.  The  Tribunal  also  had accepted this position. Under these circumstances, we do not find any  illegality in  the order  passed by  the  Tribunal warranting issue of notice. The special leave petition is dismissed.","The Special Leave Petition has been filed against the order dated February 15, 1996 made in O.A. No.978/92 of the CAT, Principal  Bench, New Delhi.

" ORDER 1.   Admittedly,  the petitioner was found to be one of  the eligible  persons  entitled to be registered as a member  of the  Coop.  Societies for allotment of the plots  in  NOIDA. He also deposited the price within time on diverse dates  as directed  by the Society itself The NOIDA refused  allotment of the plot to the petitioner on the sole ground that 1.5.76 was  the  cut off date and who so ever was a member  of  the society prior to it would be entitled for the allotment.  As the petitioner was enrolled as a member on 8.5.76, he is not eligible  for  allotment of the plot.  It is seen  from  the record  that  the  Society  had bungled  in  the  matter  of enrollment  of members.  In consequence the  petitioner  was constrained  to  invoke arbitration proceedings  before  the competent authority The Register in his award dated  9.11.83 recorded  a clear finding that the petitioner  had  compiled with  what all the rules requires him to do and the  Society had  committed  bungling in not forwarding the name  of  the petitioner  within the time.  Consequently, a direction  was given  to  forward  the  name  of  the  petitioner  for  the enrollment  as  a member.  The award became  final  and  the Society was bound by it. Since it came to be received  after the  due date, the registration has been made after  7  days from  the  cut off date put by this Court in NOIDA  v.  U.P. Residents  Emp.  Coop.  Hsg.  Bldg.  Society,  1990  (supp.) SCC 175.  The petitioner was in no way responsible for delay in  admission beyond the cut off date.  In view of the  fact that the petitioner himself has been agitating for his right to  membership and for allotment of plot and having  already deposited  the amount, we think that he cannot be  penallsed for  misfeasance of the Society.  Under  the  circumstances, the  writ  petition has to be allowed.   It  is  accordingly allowed under the said special circumstances but not on  any other  ground    and  it cannot be used as  a  precedent  to overcome the cut off date fixed by this Court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 2.   It  is brought to our notice that the respondents  have refunded  the entire amount deposited by the petitioner  and he  had  kept  the  amount in  a  separate  account  earning interest  thereon.  The petitioner is directed  to  withdraw the  amount from the account with notice to  the  respondent and it is open to the respondent to verify this fact.  After withdrawal of the amount, the petitioner should  immediately deposit  the  entire  amount to  funded  by  the  respondent together with interest earned thereon, with the  respondent.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. The special  leave petition  arises from  the  order of Maharashtra Administrative  Tribunal, Bombay  Bench, made in OA No.558  of  1991.  The  finding  recorded  by    all  the authorities is that the petitioner has misappropriated a sum of  Rs.1440/-  deducted  from  the  employees  and  had  not deposited unti  asked to  pay the same in 1985. Thereby, the authorities have concluded that the petitioner has committed misconduct. On  that finding,  the Enquiry Officer found him guilty. The disciplinary authority removed him from service. The Petitioner  challenged the  order in the High Court. The High Court  allowed the  petitioner  to  withdraw  the  writ petition with  liberty to avail the alternative remedy.  The Tribunal found  that there  is no proper explanation for the inordinate delay  in assailing the disciplinary action. That apart, even on merits also, we do no think that there is any case made  out for  interference. The  finding is  that  the petitioner has  committed  misappropriation  of  the  public money and his removal from service is an appropriate order. Learned counsel  for the  petitioner sought  to contend that the  petitioner has  not committed any misappropriation and that  he was  forced to  deposit the  money.  We  cannot accept  the   contention  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the petitioner himself  had deposited  the amount.  It  is  then contended that  the preliminary  enquiry  was  not  properly conducted  and,   therefore,  the  enquiry  is  vitiated  by principles of  natural justice.  We find  no  force  in  the contention. The  preliminary  enquiry has nothing to do with the enquiry  conducted after  the issue of the charge-sheet. The former  action would  be to  find  whether  disciplinary enquiry should  be initiated  against the  delinquent. After full-fledged enquiry  was held,  the preliminary enquiry had lost its importance. Under  these   circumstances,  we   do  not   find  any illegality in  the order  passed by  the Tribunal warranting interference.

" J U D G M E N T (arising out of SLP(C)No.21143 of 2003) Dr. AR . Lakshmanan, J. Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 31.3.2003 passed by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.9346 of 2001.  The prayer before the High Court by the respondent herein was that his services in Tinsukia Degree College, Assam as Hindi Lecturer be added to the services rendered at Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith, Varanasi for calculating to his post retiral benefits.  The learned counsel for the petitioner before the High Court relied upon a Division Bench decision of Lucknow Bench of the said court in the case of Dr. Shankar Sahai Srivastava versus State of U.P.& ors. decided on 7.12.1999.  The Division Bench of the High Court following the said decision allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent herein and directed that the respondent’s service in Tinsukia Degree College, Assam shall be added to his service rendered in  Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith, Varanasi.  A further direction was given to the authorities to refix the pension within two months and the arrears of his pension be paid within the same period. Our attention was also drawn to the order passed by the Allahabad High Court in Dr. Shankar Sahai Srivastava versus State of U.P.& ors.  The said order dated 7.12.1999 reads thus: ""LUCKNOW                        Dated : 7.12.1999 Hon’ble M. Katju, J. Hon’ble U.K. Dhaon, J. Heard.

He is claiming that his earlier services in other Institutions   be  added   to his service in Kashi Vidyapith. We dispose of this Writ Petition which the direction  that petitioner’s pension be recalculated in accordance with statute 15.05 of Kashi Vidyapith within two months of production of certified copy of this order before the authority concerned.  Payment will http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 be made accordingly to the recalculation.""] A perusal of the said order would show that there was absolutely no discussion by the Bench as to why the said direction in regard to the petitioner’s pension was issued.  The order, in our opinion, is non-speaking. Aggrieved by the said order, the State of U.P. & ors preferred special leave petition before this Court, which was dismissed by this Court on 27.9.2000 on the ground of delay in approaching this Court.  The special leave petition was not disposed of by this Court on merit.  In the impugned order also, except adopting the reason given by the order dated 7.12.1999, no other reason was given by the Division Bench.  Before us,  several legal contentions have been raised by Dr. R.G. Padia, learned Senior Counsel for the State and also countered by Mr. Rohan Thanavi, learned counsel for the respondent.  In our opinion, the matter required detailed investigation with reference to Section 33 of the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973 and also with reference to the General Order issued under reference no.2148/Pandrah/15/1983-46(14)/83 dated 24.12.1983.  In our view, Regulation 15.05 of the Statute of the University is also required to be considered for determining the claim of the respondent herein.  We, therefore, remit the matter to the High Court and restore the Civil Misc. Writ Petition no.9346 of 2001 and request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition within six months from the date of production of copy of order of this Court by either party. In view of the remittal order now passed by us, we set aside the order dated 31.3.2003 passed in  Civil Misc. Writ Petition no.9346 of 2001.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. Notification under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act was  published on August 14, 1986 acquiring 12 Hectares, 95 are  88 sq,  metres of  the land  for the construction of Ahmedabad-Baroda Express  Highway. The  land are situated in village  Marida,   Tal.   Nadiad,   District   Kheda.   Land Acquisition officer  awarded compensation in his award dated 1.4.1987 at  the rate  of Rs.  250/- per  Are.  Dissatisfied therewith,  the   respondents  sought  for  enhancement  and reference was  made under  section 18. The learned Assistant District Judge,  by his  award and  decree dated  August 26, 1992, enhanced the compensation to Rs. 2,500/- per Are which was affirmed  by the  High Court  in the  impugned  judgment dated July  4, 1995 in First Appeal Nos. 1125-1150/95. Thus, these appeals by special leave. We have  heard the learned counsel on both sides. It is not necessary  to go into all other documents. Suffice it to state that  in another  award of  the Reference  court under ex.43, relating  to the  same village, the land was acquired by notification  dated may  3,  1979.  The  reference  Court awarded compensation at the rate of Rs. 2,100/- per Are. The appellants did not  carry in appeal against the award. Thus, the award  become final. The lands in question also situated in the same village but on different survey numbers. some of the  claimants   also  are  the  claimants  in  the  earlier acquisition as  well, as  stated in the note appended to the time  lag   of  8   years,  the   reference  Court   awarded compensation at the rate of Rs.2,500/- per Are. The question,  therefore, is: whether the assessment of the compensation  made by the reference court is vitiated by any error of principle of law warranting interference. It is now settled  legal position  that the award of the reference court relating  to the  same village  of  the  similar  land possessed of  same quality  of land  and potential  offer  a comparable base  for determination  of the compensation. The reference Court  also noted  in paragraphs  18 and 19 of the similarities of  the lands  under acquisition  and that they were  covered   by  EX.   43.  No  doubt,  the  lands  under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 acquisition are situated at the outskirts of the village. In the absence  of any  tangible material brought on record, as regards the  distinctive features of differentiation between the quality  of the land situated, The land , subject matter of Ex.43  and the  lands  under  acquisition  Ex.48,  it  is difficult to  find  out  whether  the  reference  Court  has applied any  wrong principle  of law in determination of the compensation. In  the light  of the findings recorded by the reference Court  in paragraphs 18 and 19 , we think that, in the absence of any distinct material brought on record, even in cross-examination  of the  witnesses, we cannot hazard to conclude  that   they  offered   no  comparable   value,  in particular, when  the award  earlier  has  already  attained finality.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We Have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the High  Court of  Delhi made  on  July  25,  1995  in  CMP No.534/92 wherein it was held that the appeal had abated and consequently the same was dismissed. It is not necessary to dilate upon the facts on merits. Suffice it  to state  that pending  first appeal in the High Court,  the   sole  appellant  died  on  December  1,  1990. Intimation of  death  was  given  by  the  counsel  for  the respondents on August 5, 1991, but the application could not be filed due to the delay on the part of the counsel for the deceased-appellant as  sworn in  by him  in  his  affidavit. Consequently, the  appeal having  abated  was  dismissed  on November 18,  1991. Then  an application came to be filed on May  4,   1992  seeking  setting  aside  of  the  abatement, condonation of  the delay  in filing  the application and to bring the  legal representatives  of the  sole appellant  on record. That application came to be dismissed for failure to give proper explanation. Thus, this appeal by special leave.

" O R D E R Leave granted In this case we are concerned with the notice issued by the Second  Additional Sessions  Judge, Buldana, on December 3, 1990 to the appellants for prosecution under sections 194 and 195,  I.P.C for  alleged fabrication  of the  record and setting up  a case  said to  be false  against  two  ladies, Jamman and  Laxmi said  to be  aged about  60 and  80  years respectively. The  Additional Sessions Judge had stated that they are  infirm persons;  unable to  walk and stand without the support  of others.  Consequently, it would be difficult to believe the version of the police that they pelted stones and  kicked  the  police  officers  while  the  latter  were discharging the  official duty  in apprehending Latur Hasan. While setting  aside the charges framed against them, notice was issued  under section  340, Cr.  P.C. for prosecution of the appellants under sections 194 and 195, I.P.C. It is  seen that  the observation  made by the Sessions Judge, as  confirmed by  the of  Bombay High  Court,  Nagpur Bench in  the impugned  judgment  dated  10.3.1992  made  in Criminal Application  No.20/91 is  based on  161  statements recorded during  the investigation.  Admittedly, no evidence has  been  recorded.  The  court  Should  not  come  to  the conclusion on  the basis  of 161  statements which  are  not evidence.  It   can  be   used  at   the  trial   only   for contradictions or  omissions when  the witness was examined. Nor it  could be  contradicted by  looking at  the  physical features of the witnesses even before they are examined. The Additional Sessions  Judge had  discharged  them  concluding that the police officers had fabricated the record. It would appear that  the learned  Sessions Judge had overstepped his jurisdiction in  recording a  finding, while  looking at the physical features  of  the  accused,  that  the  police  had fabricated the  record. The High Court has also not properly considered  the   matter  while   going  into  the  question http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 regarding discharge of the accused for other offences. Under these circumstances,  we hold  that in  view of  the finding recorded by  the Sessions Judge of fabrication of the record and that  the case  is false  one, issuance  of notice under Section 340,  Cr.P.C. is  wholly unjustified. The said order of the Sessions Judge is accordingly quashed. The appeal is accordingly allowed.",Jamman and Laxmi said to be aged about 60 and 80 years respectively.

Gupta, for the appellant. B.B. Ahuja and R.N. Sachthey, for respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KHANNA,  J.   This appeal on certificate  is  against  the judgment  of the Calcutta High Court whereby the High  Court answered the following question referred to it under section http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 27  of  the  Wealth Tax Act in  favour of  the  revenue  and against the assessee-appellant: ""Whether on the facts and in the  circum- stances   of   the   case,  the  provision  of Rs.49,19,520/-  made by the assessee  for  its tax  liability  less the amount  of  the  last instalment  of advance tax constituted a  debt owed  by the assessee within the   meaning  of clause (m) of section 2 of the Wealth Tax  Act on the relevant valuation date ?"" The  matter  relates to the assessment  year  1958-59,   the relevant valuation date for which was December 31,  1957.  A sum  of Rs.49,19,520/- was provided for in the books of  the appellant for the dis- 3 --1546 SCI/76 296 charge  of  its tax liabilities. The appellant  claimed  the amount as a deduction in the computation of the net  wealth. The  claim  was disallowed by the wealth  tax  officer,  the Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner  of Wealth  Tax  and  the Tribunal.  On  an application filed by  the  appellant,  the Tribunal referred the question reproduced above to the  High Court. The  High Court, while answering the question in  favour of  the revenue and against the  assessee-appellant,  relied upon  its  earlier decision in the case  of  Assam  Oil  Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Central Calcutta(1). The  decision in the case of Assam Oil Co,  Ltd.  relied upon by the High Court was reversed on appeal by this Court. Naturally therefore at the hearing of the appeal, Mr.  Rama- chandran,  learned counsel for the appellant, has drawn  our attention  to  that decision of this Court in  the  case  of Assam Oil Co. v. Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Central Calcut- ta(2).  It was held in that case by majority that the amount set  apart by the appellant-company in its balance-sheet  as on  December 31, 1956 as an estimated provision for  meeting its tax liability, less the last instalment of the demand of the advance tax, was a debt owed by the appellant company on December  31, 1956, the relevant valuation date, within  the meaning of section 2(m) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957, and was deductible  in  computing its net wealth as  on  that  date. Following that decision, we are of the view that the  answer to  the question referred by the Tribunal to the High  Court should  be  in the affirmative in favour  of  the  assessee- appellant  and against the revenue. Mr. Ahuja  submits  that the view taken by the majority in the case of Assam Oil  Co. Ltd. needs reconsideration. This Bench, however, is bound by that  decision.   Following  that decision,  we  accept  the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and  answer the question referred by the Tribunal in the affirmative  in favour  of the assessee-appellant  and against the  revenue.

" JUDGMENT NANAVATI. J. The  plaintiff-respondent  claiming   a   right   of pre-emption   on  the  ground  of  being  ’Shafi-i-jar’  and ’Shafi-i-sharik’ filed a suit in the Court of  Civil  judge, Senior Division.  Sholapur being Special Civil Suit No.  376 of  1990 and prayed for a decree of pre-emption and also for a direction to the appellants to sell the suit property  for the  price  mentioned  in  the  sale  deed executed by their sisters in his favour.  The trial Court on  appreciation  of the evidence lad by the parties held that the respondent was no  longer  a co-sharer, as in the suit filed by the sisters for partition a decree was passed in their favour and in the execution proceedings, Suit House No.  85 went  to  the  two sisters  and  the  appellant  became  the owner of House No. 84-B.  The Trial Court, therefore, held that the  appellants did not fall into class I of the persons who are entitled to claim pre-emption under the Mohammedan Law.  It further held that  the  appellants  who  were defendants in the suit have also their  property  adjoining  to  House  No.    85   and, therefore,  they  are  also  entitled  to claim the right of pre-emption.  As the respondent and the appellants belong to the same class both are entitled to half share in  the  suit property.  Accordingly,  it  partly  decreed  the suit.  The respondent was directed to deposit  Rs.    92,500/-  in  the Court  and  the  appellants  were directed to execute a sale deed for half the suit property. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment and  decree passed by the Trial Court the appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court. No appeal or cross objections were filed by  the respondent.  The  High  Court  dismissed  the  appeal on the ground that it was without  any  substance.  The  appellants have  therefore,  filed this appeal challenging the judgment and order passed by the High court. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants  is that  the only ground on which the plaintiff’s suit has been decreed is that he being a  ’shafi-i-jar’  was  entitled  to claim the  right  of  pre-emption.    He submitted that this Court in Bhau Ram V.  B.  Baijnath Singh.  1962 Suppl.   (3) SCR 724 and  in  Sant  Ram and Ors.  V.  Labh Singh and Ors. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 964 (7) SCR 756 has held that law of  pre-emption  based  on Vicinage is  void.    Unfortunately,  attention  of the High Court was not drawn to these two  decisions  of  this  Court and, therefore, the High Court did not consider this aspect. As   the   very   basis   of  claim  has  been  held  to  be unconstitutional by  this  Court,  the  suit  filed  by  the plaintiff ought to have been dismissed.  We, therefore allow this  appeal, set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court and dismiss the suit filed by the respondent.  It will be open  to  the  respondent  to  withdraw  the  amount deposited by  him  in  the  Trial  Court.

" CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 325  of 1974. Appeal  by Special Leave from the Judgment and  Order  dated the 8th April, 1974 of the Bombay High Court in Crl.  Appeal No. 305 of 1974. Sharad  Manchar, B. P. Maheshwari and Suresh Sethi, for  the appellants. S. B. Wad and M. N. Shroff, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANMOHAN  REDDY, J.-We have just now admitted the  special leave,  petition and after the appeal was  registered  heard the learned Advocates for the parties.  This is yet  another case  in which a criminal first appeal against a  conviction has  been  dismissed  summarily under  Section  421  of  the Criminal Procedure Code.  We have heard both sides.  Mr. Wad for the State has strenuously contended that the High  Court has  power  to  dismiss  summarily  and  has  cited  several http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 decisions,  but in all these cases there is nothing  to  the contrary  to  justify a view different from the one  we  are taking  in this case.  It is submitted that  the  dismissal, was so summary that even the record was not called for.   No doubt,  Section  421, Criminal Procedure Code  does  vest  a power  in the High Court to dismiss an appeal summarily  but it can do so only on a perusal of the petition and the  copy of  the  judgment.  Inasmuch as under our  Constitution  any person aggrieved by an order of the High Court can  petition to this Court under Article 136 for special leave, it is not only  necessary  but  having regard to the  long  series  of decisions  beginning as far back as 1953 (see 1953 SCR  809) onwards which discourages this practice of dismissal by  one word ’dismissed’, the High Court should at least have  given some reasons 67 why  no  arguable  case is made out on a  perusal  of  those documents.  Since we are not in a position to ascertain  and it  is contended before us that arguable points do arise  in this case in support of which the statement made in  special leave petition has been read to us, we are not in a position to say that an arguable case does not arise.  We would  have been  able to do so even if we had the slightest inkling  in the order of the High Court.  In the absence of any  reasons what has been happening in many cases is that special  leave is admitted, and after hearing the appeal if this Court  has come to the conclusion that the conviction is valid, it  has held that the dismissal by the High Court is justified.  But this  method, in our view, reverses the process and  imposes unnecessary  burden  on this Court.  What should  have  been done by the High Court, is now being done by this Court.  It is  only  after sending for the records, getting  the  paper books prepared, hearing both parties in the appeal and after appreciation  of  the evidence that it may be held  that  in some cases the dismissal, in fact, was ultimately justified. In many cases the appeals were even allowed. Long  avoidable  delay thus ensues during which  the  person convicted entertains a doubt about his conviction and has to suffer the anxiety caused thereby. We do hope and trust that the series of decisions over  this long  period  disapproving  of  the  practice  of  summarily dismissing by one word will be taken note of and this  Court will  not be ultimately burdened with such  appeals  arising out  of summary dismissals which is really the  function  of the High Court at the first instance. The  appeal is accordingly allowed.  The order of  the  High Court  is  set aside.  The appeal is remanded  to  the  High Court  for hearing for admission and disposal in  accordance with  law  and in the light of the directions made  here  in above. V.P.S.

The Land  Acquisition  Collector  classified  the  land  and awarded the  compensation @  Rs.2,000/- to 3,000/- per bigha to the  respective  lands.  On  reference  under  s.18,  the reference court  enhanced the  market value to Rs.8,500/- to Rs.6,500/- per bigha while maintaining classification of the land. In  First Appeal No.81/86 and other connected cases by Judgment and  decree dated  January 30,  1989, Guwahati High Court affirmed  the award and decree of the reference court. Thus these appeals by special leave. We have  gone through  the judgment  of  the  Reference Court vis-a-vis the judgment of the High Court. We found, on the facts  and circumstances  of the  case, that appropriate market value  would be  Rs.4,875/- and Rs.6,375/- instead of Rs.6,500/- and  8,500/- respectively  for the  lands  as  it would reflect  the prevailing market value as on the date of the Notification,  namely, July  3, 1979.  Accordingly,  the market value  is determined at Rs.4,875/- and Rs.6,375/- per bigha as  per the  classification, nature and quality of the lands. Award  of the  reference court  being made  after the Amendment  Act  had  come  into  force,  the  claimants  are entitled to  the statutory  benefits of the Amendment Act 68 of 1984.

They are also entitled to 12% of the additional amount under s.23(1-A) of the Act. The appeals are disposed of accordingly. The award and decree of the reference court is modified accordingly.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short  the ’Act’) was published on September 16,  1981   acquiring  3  acres  17  decimals  of  land  for Suvarnarekha Project.  The Land  Acquisition Officer  by his award  dated  September  3,  1985  granted  compensation  at Rs.14,445/- per  acre. On  reference, the  Subordinate Judge enhanced it  to Rs.15,055/- per acre. Both the State as well as the  claimants filed  the appeals  in the High Court. The High Court  in the  impugned judgment in FA No.105 and 93 of 1987  dated  June  1,  1993  enhanced  the  compensation  to Rs.45,000/- per  acre treating the acquired land in Don I as cultivable land.  It also  granted Rs.20,000/-  towards  the well  and  statutory  solatium  and  interest.  Thus,  these appeals by special leave. The question  that arises for consideration is: whether the High  Court was  justified in enhancing the compensation to Rs.45,000/-  per acre? The High Court has relied upon the sale deed Ext.3/A dated March 16, 1981 pertaining to lead of an extent  of 25 decimals of Don-II lands and 14 decimals of Don-I lands  sold for  consideration of Rs.16,000/-. It also relied upon another sale deed of the year 1983 with value of Rs.1,10,000/- per  decimal, in  other words, Rs.45,000/- per acre. Unfortunately,  neither the  vendor nor the vendee has been examined in proof of passing of the consideration under the sale  deed etc.  Only a  clerk of  the Sub-registrar was called as  witnesses to  prove the  sale deeds which are the certified copies  of the sale deeds. No doubt, under Section 51-A of  the Act,  the certified  copy of  the sale  deed is admissible as  evidence to  get over the difficulties of the owner of  the document  would not produce the original title deeds. The  clerk  of  the  Sub-registrar  has  proved  that material as secondary evidence but other factors aliunde has to be established that the sale deed offers comparable value for determining the compensation at Rs.45,000/- per acre. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 This Court  had elaborately  considered and  laid  this principle of  law in a catena of decisions, the latest being R.Ram Reddy & Ors. vs. Land Acquisition Officer, Hyderadad & Urban Development  Authority, Hyderabad & Ors. [(1995) 2 SCC 305]. Therefore, it needs no reiteration. But, the  fact is that the lands are situated very near to the  national highway  but 4 km. away from the Jamshedpur city. Under  these circumstances,  taking into consideration the facts  and circumstances,  we are  of the  view that the reasonable compensation  would be  Rs.22,000/- per acre. The claimants are  not entitled  to the  value of  the well i.e, Rs.20,000/- since  the well was being used for irrigation of the land.  For the reason, it cannot be separately valued as held by  this Court in O.Janardhan Reddy & Ors. vs. Spl. Dy. Collector, L.A Unit-IV, LMD, Karimnagar, A.P. & Ors. [(1994) 6 SCC 456]. The appeals  are accordingly partly allowed. The market value of  lands is  determined at  Rs.22,000/- per acre with solatium and  interest and  also additional  amount  as  per Section 23(2)  @ 30%  on the enhanced compensation, interest under Section  28 for the first year at 9% and thereafter at 15% on  the enhanced  compensation from  the date  of taking possession till  date of  deposit. They are also entitled to the additional  amount at  12% p.a. under Section 23(1-A) of the Act  from date  of notification  under section 4(1) till date of  award or taking possession whichever is earlier.

This appeal  by special leave is directed against an  order, dated  March 28,  1979, whereby  the High Court of  Rajasthan dismissed  the  appellant’s  application under Section  482, Criminal  Procedure Code  and refused to set aside  an order  dated August  14, 1978  of the Sessions Judge framing a charge under Section 201, Penal Code against the appellant. The prosecution  case as  put in Court is that on March 4, 1978,  one Padam  Singh was  shot dead at the farm of the appellant by  the accused, Doongar Singh, in conspiracy with the  accused,   Hanif  and  Shambhoo  Singh.  Padam  Singh’s deadbody was  first put  in a  jeep for removal. After going some distance  the  jeep  went  out  of  order.  Thereafter, Doongar Singh brought the car of the appellant. The deadbody was then  transhipped into  the car (RJF 2118) and was taken to a  distance and thrown into a lonely well on the boundary of village,  Ramasani.

It  is  not alleged that the appellant was in any manner concerned as an abettor or  accomplice in  the  murder  or  participated  or abetted the  removal and  disposal of  the deadbody of Padam Singh. The  only allegation  on the  basis of which a charge under Section 201, Indian Penal Code has been framed against the appellant  is that  on March 8, 1978, that is, five days after the  murder of  Padam Singh,  he got his car washed at the Petrol  Pump of  one Umrao Khan. In this connection, the investigating Police  Officer examined  Sardar Khan  son  of Umrao Khan,  Petrol Pump  dealer and  his servant, Mangilal. There is  nothing in  their statements  that there  was  any blood on  the car which was washed. There was not an iota of material on  the record  to furnish  basis even  for a grave suspicion that  by getting  the car washed on the 8th March, 1978, the  appellant caused  any  blood  or  other  evidence concerning the  murder of  Padam Singh,  to  disappear.  The presence of  bloodstains on  the car  on the 8th March stood negatived by  the prosecution’s own assertion (in the police challan) that  Doongar Singh  had got  the blood  on the car washed on the day of the murder, itself. The mere 150 washing of  the car  on the  8th March  could  not,  by  any stretch of  imagination, be  prima  facie  evidence  of  the factual ingredients  of an  offence under Section 201, Penal Code. The  impugned order  of the Sessions Judge being based on no evidential material, whatever, was manifestly illegal. We, therefore,  allow this  appeal, set  aside the  impugned Order and quash the charge framed against the appellant. S.R.

The petitioners have alleged that earlier there was a writ petition filed by some other petitioner alleging that the project would cause serious environmental problems.  That writ petition was disposed of finally by the High Court and the Special Leave Petitions (SLP (C.) No. 19176/2005 and SLP (C.) No. 20758/2005)  are now pending before this Court.    In the batch of writ petitions pending before the High Court, the petitioners therein have raised certain other objections and contended that there may be an alternative alignment of the project so that it may not cause any damage to the Adam’s Bridge/Rama Setu which is in existence, according to the petitioners in the writ petitions.  The writ petitioners have also alleged that there should be a detailed archaeological survey regarding the project.  The Division Bench of the High Court issued notices in the writ petitions and by its detailed order on 19th June, 2007, the High Court has also given a direction to the Union of India to disclose whether any archaeological survey was done to consider Adam’s Bridge/Rama Setu can be regarded as a National Monument http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 under the Ancient Monuments as Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.

Accordingly, the transfer petitions are allowed. As the High Court has given certain directions in the pending writ petitions, the respondents in the writ petitions who were the petitioners before this Court shall file a detailed affidavit in the transferred cases, indicating their stand,  and the steps taken by them.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition is filed against the order of the  Orissa Administrative  Tribunal at Cuttack passed on December 6, 1996, in Transfer Application No.610/87. Admittedly, the  petitioner, while working as Lecturer, had appeared  in competitive examination and was selected to the Orissa  Administrative Service. As Orissa Administrative Service, Class-II,  his  scale  of  pay  was  Rs.525-1150/-. Earlier, also  when he  worked as Lecturer, the scale of pay was Rs.525-1150/-  which was  subsequently  revised  by  the University Grants Commission w.e.f. April 1, 1974 to Rs.700- 1600/-. In  that pay  scale, his pay fixed at Rs.780. He was paid  arrears  of  salary  with  retrospective  effect  from 1.1.1974. After  he was selected and appointed to the Orissa Administrative Service,  he sought  protection of  his  last drawn pay  and his  upgraded fitment in the pay scale in the Orissa Administrative Service. The Tribunal has rejected the claim. Thus this special leave petition. Shri Janaranjan  Das, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, contends  that since  the  petitioner  had  been given the pay scale with retrospective effect from 1.1.1974, on his appointment to the Orissa Administrative Service, his last drawn pay need to be protected. As per the instructions of the  Accountant General,  his pay is entitled to be fixed at Rs.780/-  in the  pay scale  in  the  service  of  Orissa Administrative Service.  We find no force in the contention. The service  as a  Lecturer is  entirely different  from the service of the Orissa Administrative Service. Merely because he happened to work earlier as a Lecture and in the same pay scale which was subsequently revised, he cannot be permitted to have  the benefit  of U.G.C.  scale in the Administrative Service and  fitment in  the pay-scale  on that  basis. That would create  imbalance and  gross infraction and distortion and would  result in  flood of  claims of similarly situated persons under  Article 39(d) of the Consitution. Under these circumstances, such  a course  cannot  be  permitted  to  be adopted.

" JUDGMENT KAPADIA, J. Although, I respectfully agree with the conclusion contained in the opinion of brother, Arijit Pasayat, the importance of the scoring system in the tender process has impelled me to elucidate and clarify certain crucial aspects. Hence, this separate opinion. The basic controversy in the present case is: whether the E.C. had exceeded its authority in the assessment of technical pre-qualification. In the scoring system objectivity has an important role to play (Clause 5.4).  In the scoring system the identification of factors (including sub-factors), allocation of marks to each of these factors (including sub-factors) and giving of marks are three distinct and different stages.  Clause 5.4 dealt with assessment of technical pre-qualifications.  Under that clause a scoring system was to be applied based on the assessment of the Terms of the Offer against the Technical Pre-qualification criteria.  It further stipulated that assessment shall be on absolute basis and not relative as between the offers.  Under the said system, each factor had to be allocated certain marks. Objectivity had to be provided in the allocation of marks (and not in giving of marks) to each factor (including sub-factors). This was not done.  For example, RFP required certain marks to be allocated for absorption of existing staff.  Greater the absorption, higher the marks to be given.  In the present case, the E.C. changed the factor, namely, ""absorption of employees"" to the overall approach.  This led to change in priority. Similarly, in the RFP, the factor earmarked was ""property development"" which E.C. compared to ""infrastructure development"".  Experience in property development is different from experience in infrastructure development.  Similarly, RFP had given weightage to aeronautical revenue whereas in allocation of marks, E.C. obliterated the difference between aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues.  The above examples are given only to show that objectivity which was the underlying principle underlying clause 5.4 is completely lost either by expanding the enumerated factors like aeronautical revenue, overall capability vis-‘-vis capacity to absorb existing work-force and comparison of property development with infrastructure development or by allocating un-even marks to sub-factors.  In my view, E.C. had no business to expand or narrow down the scope of any of the above factors as it was beyond its authority and contrary to the scoring system. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 With these words, I agree with the conclusion contained in the opinion of brother, Arijit Pasayat.",The basic controversy in the present case is: whether the E.C. had exceeded its authority in the assessment of technical pre-qualification.

To  add  to  it further, the  courts have  almost always  observed that  the instance of  such aberrations  should not  be treated  as  a precedent in future. Such casual discretions by the Court is nothing but  an abuse  of the process; more so when the High Court  at  its  level  itself  becomes  conscious  that  the decision  was  wrong  and  was  not  worth  repeating  as  a precedent. And  yet it  is repeated  time and  again. Having said this much, we hope and trust that unless the High Court can justify its decision on principle and precept, it should better desist  from passing  such orders,  for it  puts  the ’Rule of Law’ to a mockery, and promotes rather the ’Rule of Man’.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.  6559    OF 2002 Application for intervention is dismissed. Heard the parties. Briefly stated the facts are as follows: The appellant belongs to Scheduled Castes.   He was appointed as an Engineering Supervisor in the Agricultural Market Committee.  The service condition of the respondent was then governed by the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and livestock) Market Service Rules 1969.  On 23.9.1994 the respondent was transferred to the Central Market Fund Service.  Central Market Fund Service was governed by the Service Rules of 1984.   Clause 3 of Rule 6 inter alia states that the provisions of Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, Andhra Ministerial Service Rules on matter not covered by these rules shall be applicable to the members of the service.  Rule 22 of the General Rules, provides  for reservation.  Rule 22(a) provides that the unit of appointment for the purpose of this rule shall be one hundred of which fifteen shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes, six shall be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes, twenty-five shall be reserved for the backward classes and the remaining fifty-four appointments shall be on the basis of open competition. -2- It is urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Division Bench of the High Court has allowed the writ petition by upsetting the findings of the Tribunal erroneously. We have considered the provisions of Rule 6 which deals with application of the general Rules.  It is contended that Rule 6 should be considered in perspective along with Rule 22 of the general Rules. The appellant belonged to Scheduled Castes and hence it s alleged that he is entitled to be considered from the 15% reservation as contained in Rule 22(a) of the Rules. We have gone through the entire judgment of the High Court impugned herein.  The question of  application of Rule 6 read with Rule 22 of the general Rules has not been considered by the High Court.  On this short question we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and the matter is remanded to the High Court to consider the application of Rule 6 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the Central Service Rules along with Rule 22(a) of the general Rules as referred to above.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1068 of 1987. From the  Judgment and Order dated 16.5.86 of the Patna High Court in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 2523 of 1981. A.K. Sil and S.K. Sinha for the Appellants. D.N. Goburdhan for the Respondents. The following Order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R The 1st  respondent-Subodh Chandra  is  working  as  an operator   grade-III    under   the   Hindustan   Fertilizer Corporation Ltd.  at Sindhri.  The date of birth recorded in the  register   maintained  by   the  Hindustan   Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. was 1.6.1931 and in the usual course he has to retire from service on 1.6.1989 on completion of 58 years of age. He, however, filed a writ petition in the High Court of Patna  claiming that  his date of birth should be altered to 20th October, 1938. In support of his case he relied on a certificate issued  by the  Chief Medical  Officer, Sindhri. The petition  was  contested  by  the  Hindustan  Fertilizer Corporation of  India Ltd. After hearing the learned counsel for the  parties, the  learned Judge  who heard the petition held that  it was not possible to accept the case of the 1st respondent that  he was born in the year 1938 and he further found that  the date of birth as recorded in the register of the Corporation  should not  be interfered with. The learned Judge, however, passed the following order: ""S. Shamsul  Hasan, J.:  After the matter had been heard at  great length  and legal and factual pros and cons  had been  examined it  appeared that the year of  the birth  of the  petitioner being  1931 cannot   be    assailed   nor   interfered   with. Consequently,  Mr.   Ojha  felt   that  since  the petitioner has  his problem domestic or otherwise- and he  in 1971  was in  fact given  to understand that  his  year  of  birth  would  be  1938,  some compassionate endowment may be made in his favour. I am entirely in agreement with Mr. Ojha. I, therefore,  dispose  of  this  application with an  expression of  my desire,  which  may  be treated as  a mandate,  that the petitioner may be given three more years of service as a 864 special case  after his  due date  of  retirement, which could  be done  by reappointing him for that period. It  is made  clear that  this may  not  be treated as  a precedent  for any other employee of the Institution or in any other case."" We are  of opinion that the learned Single Judge having found that  the date  of birth  of  the  1st  respondent  as recorded in the register of the appellant-Corporation should not be  interfered with, committed a serious error in making an order  directing the  appellant-Corporation ’as a special case’ to  reappoint the 1st respondent for a period of three more years  after his  ’due date  of retirement’,  which  is 1.6.1989. There  was hardly  any justification  for  passing such an  order under  Article 226  of the  Constitution. The reason given  by the  High Court  is wholly  untenable.

" CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: CIVIL Appeal No. 4160 of 1985. 852 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 From the  Judgment and Order dated 25.6.1984 of the Kerala High Court in T.R.C. No. 19 of 1984. V. J. Francis for the Appellant. T.  M. Ansari,  Markose Vellapally and D. N. Misra for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI,  J.  The  sole  question  which  arises  for determination in  this appeal  is as  to what is the rate at which the  goods which  had been purchased earlier and which were in  stock with  the assessee on 30-6-74 were assessable to purchase  tax when  the purchases  were found  to be last purchases as  a result of events which took place subsequent to 30.6.1974.  This question  has become  material since the rate of purchase tax was increased from 3% to 5% with effect from 1st  July, 1974.  Now it is not disputed in the present case that  the purchases  of goods  effected by the assessee prior to  30-6-74  were  last  purchases  within  the  State because the  goods purchased  which were in stock on 30.6.74 were subsequently  sold by  the assessee  in the  course  of inter-state trade or commerce which means that they were not sold within the State and hence the assessee was clearly the last purchaser  within the  State and  as such was liable to pay purchase  tax under Item 71 of the First Schedule to the Kerala General  Sales Tax  Act. Equally it is clear that the assessee could  not be  made liable  to tax on the purchases made by  it prior  to 30th  June 1974,  unless the purchases acquired the  quality of  being last purchases in the State. It was  pointed out by this Court in State of Madras v. Shri T. Narayanaswami  Naidu & Anr.(1) when the assessee ""files a return and  declares the  stock in  hand, the  stock in hand cannot be  said to  have  been  acquired  by  last  purchase because he  may still  during the next assessment year, sell it or  he may  consume  it  himself  or  the  goods  may  be destroyed, etc.  He would  be entitled  to claim  before the assessing authorities  that the  character of acquisition of the stock in hand was undermined; in the light of subsequent events it may or may not become the last purchase inside the State."" There can therefore be no doubt that the assessee in the present  case became  liable to pay tax on the purchases made by  it prior  to 30th  June, 1974, as soon as it became determined though  subsequent to  30th June 1974, that these purchases were  last purchases  inside the  State  and  were consequently exigible to tax. (1) [1967] 3 S.C.R. 622. 853 But the  question remains  as to  what is  the rate  at which the  A assessee  was liable  to be taxed in respect of these purchases.  Since the purchases took place before 30th June 1974,  the assessee would, in our opinion, liable to be taxed at  the rate prevailing at the time when the purchases were made  and since the rate at the time was 3% of the sale price, the  High Court was right in taking the view that the purchases made  by the assessee prior to 30th June 1974 were taxable at  the rate  of 3%. We may point out that a similar view has  been taken  by the  Kerala  High  Court  in  Seaso Rubbers  v.   State  of  Kerala(1).  We  find  ourselves  in agreement with  the reasoning  adopted by  the Full Bench of the High Court in that case. We  accordingly reject the appeal but with no order as to costs.

The  respondent who is the assessee owned an estate  of  590 acres  in South Malabar district, now in Kerala State.   Out of  that  area 85 acres were covered  by  Pepper,  Arecanut, Paddy and Coconut cultivation while the rest i.e. 505  acres had rubber plantations upon it.  Of that area 235 acres were occupied by immature non-bearing rubber trees and 270’ acres had mature rubber trees.  The assessment relates to the year 1955-56, the accounting year being the year ending March 31, 1955.   The  respondent  claimed  from  out  of  the  income expenses relating to the maintenance and upkeep of  immature non-bearing  rubber  trees.   The  Agricultural  Income  tax Tribunal  held that the expenses incurred on the whole  area under  rubber  plantations  were  deductible  expenses   and remanded the case for ascertaining the expenses incurred  in forking  and  manuring  of the  ""non-bearing  and  immature"" rubber  grown  areas also.  The appellant then  preferred  a revision application to the High Court under s. 54(1) of the Madras  Plantations Agricultural Income Tax Act, 1955  (Mad. V  of 1955).  The High Court held that the amount  spent  on the  upkeep and maintenance of immature rubber trees  was  a deductible  expenditure  under  s. 5(e) of  that  Act  which provides: S.5  ""Computation of agricultural  income: The  agricultural income of a person shall  be computed    after   making    the    following deductions, namely:.............................. :...........

The  provisions of s. 5(e) of the Madras Act, applicable  to the  present case, are the same as those of s. 5(j)  of  the Travancore  Cochin Agricultural Income Tax Act (Act XXII  of 1950).   The only difference is in the last few  words.   In place of ""for the purpose of the plantation"" in the former, the words ""for the purpose of 287 deriving  the agricultural income"" are used in  the  latter. If anything the words of the former Act are more  favourable to the respondent. In Travancore Rubber and Tea Company Ltd. v. Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax, Kerala (1), which was an assessment under  the  Travancore  Cochin  Act,  we  have  decided  the question  of deductibility of sums expended for purposes  of forking, manuring etc. of immature rubber trees.  That judg- ment  will  govern this case also.   This  appeal  therefore fails and is dismissed with costs in this court and the High Court.

" R.C. Lahoti, J. Leave granted. A suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession filed by the plaintiff-respondents was dismissed by the trial Court but decreed in appeal.  The Municipal Corporation, the appellant before us, filed a second appeal in the High Court.   There was a delay of 39 days in filing the second appeal.  The memo of appeal was accompanied by an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act seeking condonation of delay in filing the second appeal.  The reason set out for condonation of delay was that the Municipal Corporation had appointed an advocate to appear on its behalf who failed to appear in the first appellate Court when the appeal was heard, on account of some confusion in noting the date of hearing in the court case diary maintained in the office of the advocate and it was the belated knowledge of the judgment and decree of the appellate Court on the part of the advocate, and consequently on the part of the Municipal Corporation, which had caused the delay in filing the appeal. Affidavits by the Revenue Officer and the counsel representing the Municipal Corporation were filed in the High Court.  The application was vehemently contested on behalf of the plaintiff-respondents.  The High Court formed an opinion that sufficient cause within the meaning of Section 5 of the Limitation Act was not made out and, therefore, directed the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to be dismissed and consequent thereupon the appeal itself was dismissed as barred by time.  The Municipal Corporation has filed this appeal by special leave. The contest before this Court has been more vehement than what it appears to have been before the High Court.  It is true that sanctity attaches with the record of court proceedings.  However, in the present case the question is not so much of casting a doubt on the record of proceedings maintained by the Court as is on testing the bona fides  of the counsel who filed his own affidavit in support of the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.  The counsel and the Revenue Officer, who filed their affidavits, do not have any personal interest in the matter.  The learned advocate appearing for the Municipal Corporation was not going to gain anything either by remaining absent at the time of hearing of the first appeal or by assigning a false cause for his non-appearance at the time of hearing. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Valuable rights of the parties in an immoveable property are involved. On the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the High Court ought to have been taken a liberal, and not a rigid and too technical a view of the issue before it and should have condoned the delay in filing the appeal and concentrated on examining whether the appeal raised any substantial question of law worth being heard by the High Court.  In our opinion, a sufficient cause for condoning the delay in filing the appeal before the High Court is made out. The appeal is allowed.  The impugned order of the High Court is set aside. The appeal is restored on the file of the High Court.  The delay in filing the appeal shall stand condoned.  The appeal filed by the Municipal Corporation shall now be taken up for hearing in accordance with law.  No order as to the costs. .. .......................J. ( R.C.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Though the  respondent has  been served with notice, he has not  been either  appeared in person or through counsel, we request  Shri R.S.  Sodhi, the  learned counsel to assist the Court  as Amicus Curiae. We express our appreciation for the valuable  assistance rendered  by him.  The facts fairly are not in dispute. On October 26, 1990, at about 9.30 a.m., Inspector Dharamveer  of BSF  was kidnapped  in pursuance of criminal conspiracy by some of the accused persons, while he was travelling  in a  mini bus  from Nishat to Srinagar. The accused Nazir  Ahmed Sheikh Goldenter shot him dead from his AD-56 rifle  in cold  blood. As a result of which, Inspector Dharamvir died  instantaneously. During  the course  of  the investigation, the  recoveries were  made and a confessional statement under  Section 15  of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short, ’the Act’) was recovered.  In   addition  thereto,  the  investigation  has collected other  evidence. On  March 6, 1992, a charge-sheet was filed  along with a material before the Designated Court explaining the  reasons for the delay in filling the charge- sheet. By  order dated  December 29,  1992,  the  Designated Court has  granted bail to the respondent on the ground that since the occurrence had taken place on October 26, 1990 and the charge-sheet  came to  be filed on March 6, 1992 without even calling  of the relevant case diary. Calling that order in question, the above appeal has been filed. It is  not in  dispute from these facts that the arrest of the  respondent came  to be made on March 8, 1991 and the charge-sheet was  filed on  March 6,  1992. The  question is whether the  charge-sheet  was  filed  within  the  time  or whether the  accused is  intitled to be enlarged for failure to file  the charge-sheet.  Section  20(4)  deals  with  the modification of the time prescribed under Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure  Code, 1973  (for short, ’the Code’) with http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 regard to  the filing  of the  charge-sheet. In  view of the fact that the charge-sheet contains a charge that the murder of the  officer was  committed liable  to  conviction  under Section 302  IPC. Clause  (b) of Section 167 would apply. It ways that  with reference  to sub-section (2) of Section 167 for the  words 15  days, 90  days and  6  months  where-ever occurs shall be construed with reference to one year and one year respectively  as envisaged  under  sub-section  (4)  of Section 20  of the Act. It is seen that when the accused has been arrested on March 8, 1991, the Investigating Officer is enjoined  to   produce  him  before  the  Magistrate  having jurisdiction within  24 hours  from the  date of the arrest. Consequently, the  limitation of one year would begin to run and be  counted from  next date of the arrest, namely, March 9, 1991.  Since the  charge-sheet has been filed on March 6, 1992, the Designated Court was not justified in holding that the  charge-sheet   was  not   fled  within  the  limitation prescribed under  sub-section (4)  of Section 20 of the Act, i.e., one  year. The  later amendment  to  the  Act  seeking permission of  the Court for extension of the time or filing the necessary  material to  show the  grounds on  which  the investigation could  not be  completed within the period has no application  since the  arrest  was  made  prior  to  the amendment of the Act. Under these  circumstances, the  Designated  Court  was clearly in  error in  enlarging the  accused. The  order  is accordingly set aside. The appeal is accordingly allowed. We are  informed  that  the  respondent  has  already  been  in detention in connection with other cases.","Inspector Dharamveer of BSF was kidnapped in pursuance of criminal conspiracy.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. The Appellant has been convicted under Section 25  of the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act as he was found in possession  of one DBBL gun .12 bore and five live cartridges on 17/18.3.1992.  The trail court relying upon  the  evidence of ASI  Balbir  Singh  and P.W.  4 - Man Singh - who were the members of the Police party held that it was  proved  by  the prosecution  that  the  appellant  was in possession of those articles.  The trial court further held that as the  gun  was found  loaded,  it  can  be  presumed  that it was in working order.  Taking this view,  it  convicted  the  appellant,  as stated above. Admittedly, no evidence was led by the prosecution to prove  that  the  gun  was  in working condition and that the cartridges which were found from the person of the  appellant were live  cartridges.  Neither ASI - Balbir Singh had stated so nor any report from an expert was  obtained  to  establish that the gun was in working condition and that five cartridge were live.    What  was found in the gun were two empties and not live cartridges and, therefore,  it  was  not  proper  to presume that  it was in working condition.  In absence of any evidence to that effect,  the  conviction  of  the  appellant under both  these  aforesaid  Section  cannot be upheld.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.681 OF 2008 (@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL)NO.14474 OF 2006) Leave granted. The appellant herein was an I.A.S. Officer from Bihar cadre.

" O R D E R Leave granted; We  have heard counsel on both sides. This  appeal by special leave  arises from  the order of the  Division Bench of the  Punjab &  Haryana High Court made  in C.W.P. No.8687 of 1994  on July  25, 1994.  The   respondent had retired on January 31,  1994 and  he claimed  his pension and since his pension has  not been  paid, he  invoked the jurisdiction of the High  Court. In  the impugned  order, the High Court has directed to  pay to  the respondent  the gratuity  with  12% interest thereon within one month from the date of judgment. It  further   directed  to  determine  the  pension  of  the respondent on  the basis of the emoluments last drawn by him which would  be subject  to the  final decision  that may be made in  regard to  the actual  scale of  pay to which he is eligible and  on the basis of which pension may be computed. Arrears paid  would be  adjustable thereafter.  Accordingly, direction was  given to pay the pension with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. Thus, this appeal by special leave. We issued  notice only  to see that when the dispute as regards the  computation of  pension  is  pending,  how  the liability could  be fastened  with interest for non-fixation of the  pension. Mr. Pankaj Kalra, learned counsel appearing for  the   respondent  has   stated  that  the  respondent’s entitlement is  to be  computed on  the basis  of last drawn scale of  pay as  found by  the High  Court which  would  be adjusted after the fixation of pay. According to the learned counsel, even fixation of pay has been correctly done. There fore, there  is  inaction  on  the  part  of  the  State  in computing  the   pension  payable   to  the  respondent.  He further contends  that persons  similarly situated are being paid  pension   while  the  same  is  being  denied  to  the respondent. It is contended by the appellants that the scale of pay  was provisionally  fixed and  this is  matter  under consideration. Until  it is  decided, the State is unable to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 determine the pension payable to the respondent. Under these circumstances, there  is no  slackness on  the part  of  the State in determining the pension payable to the respondent. Having considered the respective contentions, we are of the view  that the High Court’s view is not correct. So long as the  scale of pay to which the respondent is entitled has not been determined, necessarily the State Government cannot fix the  pension and that is the matter now pending decision in the  High Court.  No doubt,  specifically no reference is made to  the respondent  before fixing  the scale of pay and the action of the other subordinates has been impugned by the State. Under these  circumstances, the order of the High Court is reversed.  The appellants  are directed  to  compute  the pension on  the undisputed  scale of  pay and  pay the  same within a  period of two months from the date of decision. It would be  subject to  the decision in the pending cases. The State is  directed to  decide within six weeks from the date of receipt  of a  copy of  this order.  The  State  is  also directed to  release the  gratuity payable to the respondent within four weeks from today. The appeal is allowed.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI. J. Respondent No.  1 - Manoharrao Ganpatrao Kapsikar filed a complaint  in the  court of  CJM, Nanded, alleging that by publishing a  news item in its newspaper ""Daily Lokmath"", on 4.2.84, Mr. J.L.Darda, who was then the Chief Editor of that Daily, Mr.  Rajinder Darda, who was the Editor of the Daily, Mr. Madhukar, who was the Executive Editor of the Daily, Mr. Deshmukh, who  was connected  with publication  of the Daily and M/s.  Darda Printo  Crafts Pvt. Ltd, who were owners and proprietors of the Daily, have committed offences punishable under Sections  499, and  500, 501, 502 read with Section 34 IPC. The complaint was filed on 2.2.87. Learned  CJM   issued  process  against  all  the  five accused.  This   order  passed  by  the  learned  CJM    was challenged by the five accused before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Nanded. The learned Judge quashed that order as he  was of the opinion that by publishing that news item, none of  the accused  had committee  any offence. That order was challenged  by the  complainant by  filing a petition in the High  Court under  Section 482.  Cr. P.C. The High Court was of  the opinion  that the  learned  Additional  Sessions Judge misinterpreted  the publication.  It was  also of  the view that  when the  learned CJM. had found prima facie case against the  accused and thought it fit to issue process, it was not proper for the learned Additional Sessions Judge, to set aside the order, by exercising the revisional power. What is  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant is  that the High Court has taken a technical view of the  matter as regards the power of the Sessions Court to exercise its  revisional jurisdiction and has also committed and error  in observing  that the  report published  in  the Daily was misinterpreted by it. As we  have stated earlier, the news item was published on 4.2.84.  The complaint  in that  behalf was  filed by the complainant on  2.2.87. The  news item merely disclosed what happened during  ht debate  which took place in the Assembly on 13.12.83.  It  stated  that  when  a  Question  regarding misappropriation of Government funds meant for Majalgaon and Jaikwadi was  put to the Minister concerned, the had replied http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that a preliminary enquiry was made by the Government ant it disclosed that  some misappropriation  had taken place. When questioned further  about the  names of persons involved, he had stated  the names  of five person, including that of the complainant. The  said proceedings  came to  be published by the accused  in its Daily on 4.2.84. Because the name of the complainant was mentioned as one of the persons involved and likely to  be suspected  he filed  a  complaint  before  the learned CJM alleging that as a result of publications of the said report he had been defamed. It  is   quite  apparent  that  what  the  accused  had published in  its newspaper  was an accurate and true report of the  proceedings of  the  Assembly.  Involvement  of  the respondent was  disclosed by the preliminary enquiry made by the Government.  If the  accused  bona  fide  believing  the version of  the Minister  to be true published the report in good faith  it cannot be said that they intended to harm the reputation of the complainant. It was a report in respect of public conduct  of public  servants who  were entrusted with public funds  intended to  be used for public good. Thus the facts and  circumstances of  the case disclose that the news items was  published for public good. All these aspects have been overlooked by the High Court.

On  the other  hand, Shri Nagaraja, learned counsel for the State, contended that the right of the Government to superannuate the  employee in  exercise of    the  statutory power was  upheld by  this Court.  The  payment  of  pension requires to be decided on the date  on which the employee is required to  retire and- the residue period would be treated as fortuitous.  We need  not decide this question in view of the  fact   that  this  Court,  while  issuing  notice,  has expressly limited  to the  question as to right of the State to recover  the pension  already paid to them.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R I.A. NO. 4 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1882 OF 2004 S.B. SINHA, J : Appellant is a public sector undertaking wholly owned and controlled by the Central Government.  It obtained the services of M/s. SEDCO Forex Int. Drilling Inc. for obtaining requisite information which would assist it in the matter of exploration of oil and gas.  The information so gathered was recorded in 3-D Seismic Tapes.  On the amount paid therefor, custom duty was sought to be levied.  An exemption was claimed by the appellant from payment of custom duty in terms of an exemption notification issued by the Central Government in that behalf.  As despite such claim, assessment proceedings were initiated and completed, the matter came upto this Court and by a judgment and order dated 24.08.2006, contention of the appellant was accepted by this Court and the orders of assessment were set aside.

Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, would submit that keeping in view the fact that the appellant had to deposit a huge amount during pendency of the Civil Appeals, interest of justice would be met if this Court directs the respondent to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the said amount.  It was submitted that interest should be directed to be paid by way of restitution, as has been held by this Court in South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. v. State of M.P. and Others [(2003) 8 SCC 648]. Mr. Rajiv Dutta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would submit that the Central Government did not make any investment of the amount received by it by way of indirect tax but expended the same for the welfare of the people and, thus, no interest should be directed to be paid in the instant case. Appellant is a public sector undertaking.  Respondent is the Central http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Government.  We agree that in principle as also in equity the appellant is entitled to interest on the amount deposited on application of principle of restitution.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil  Appeal No. 236 of 1983. From the  Judgment and  Order dated  the 11th  January, 1983 of  the Punjab  and  Haryana  High  Court  in  Election Petition No.2 of 1982. M. C. Bhandare and Prem Malhotra for the Appellant. Hardev Singh and R. S. Sodhi for the Respondent. The Order of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI,  J. This  election appeal  arises out of the election held  in 1980  from the  constituency No. 56 called Hathin to the 796 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Legislative  Assembly  of  the  State  of  Haryana.  At  the counting  held  by  the  Returning  Officer,  the  Appellant secured 12,828  votes whereas respondent No. 1 Khillan Singh got  12,655   votes  and  one  Ramjilal  got  12,213  votes. Accordingly the appellant was declared as elected. Aggrieved by the  result of  the election,  Khillan Singh and Ramjilal filed election petitions in the High Court. In the course of the election  petition, the  appellant filed a recrimination petition in  which one  of the grounds related to the errors committed in  the counting of votes of respondent No. 1. All the parties agreed that the court should order a recount and that the  parties would  be  bound  by  the  result  of  the recount. The  recount was  accordingly held  as a  result of which Khillan  Singh respondent  No. 1  got 12,751  i.e. the highest number  of valid  votes and the appellant got 12,698 votes. In  view of the higher votes secured by Khillan Singh respondent No.  1 at  the recount ordered by the High Court, his petition  was allowed, the election of the appellant was set aside  and Khillan  Singh was  declared as elected. This appeal is filed against the decision of the High Court. In support  of the  appeal, Mr. Bhandare with the usual ingenuity pressed  only one point before us. He submitted on the basis  of the  Judgment of  this Court in Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal  that even  if the  result had  gone in  favour of respondent No. 1 he could not have been declared elected. We have gone  through this authority and we find that the facts of the  present case  are clearly  distinguishable.  In  the decision referred  to above  the returned  candidate did not recriminate  as   provided   under   section   97   of   the Representation of  the People  Act, 1951  and this  was  the important ground  on which  the Court said that it could not make any  attack against  the alternative  claim made by the petitioner.  In   the  instant   case,  the   appellant  had admittedly recriminated  and in  the recrimination  petition one of  the grounds taken related to the errors committed at the time  of the  counting of votes of the Ist respondent by the Returning  Officer. The appellant had also agreed to the recounting of the votes secured by all the parties. In these circumstances, this  case does  not  appear  to  be  of  any assistance to  the appellant. The decision of the High Court is in  accordance with  the result of the recount ordered by it. For the  foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed but in the  circumstances of  the case there will be no order as to costs. H.S.K.

" JUDGMENT O  R  D  E  R CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.4 OF 2005 Heard learned counsel for the parties. Six appellants, along with accused Dularey, were convicted by the Trial Court under Section 304 Part-II/149 of the Indian Penal Code [hereinafter referred to as ""I.P.C.""] and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years.  They were further convicted under Sections 147 and 148 I.P.C. but no separate sentence was awarded on any of these counts.  Convictions have been confirmed by the High Court on appeal being preferred by the accused persons.  So far as accused Dularey is concerned, it appears that he did not move this Court whereas this appeal by special leave has been filed by the remaining six accused persons. Conviction of the appellants is based upon the evidence of Roop Lal (P.W.1) and Satrohan (P.W.2), who claimed to be eye-witnesses.  These two witnesses have consistently supported the prosecution case and no infirmity could be pointed out therein.  In our view, the High Court was quite justified in confirming the convictions of the appellants. ...2/- - 2 - Turning now to the sentence awarded against the appellants, the maximum sentence under Section 304 Part-II I.P.C. that could have been awarded is ten years. So far as appellants, other than Ram Shankar @ Shankari is concerned, they have remained in custody for a period of more than four years.  Ram Shankar @ Shankari, Appellant No.4, has remained in custody for a period of two years and he is more than seventy seven years’ old.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that ends of justice would be met in case the sentence of imprisonment awarded against the appellants is reduced to the period already undergone and each one of them is directed to pay fine of Rupees ten thousand.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in-part and, while upholding the convictions of the appellants, the sentence of imprisonment awarded against them is reduced to the period already undergone and each one of them is directed to pay fine of Rupees ten thousand; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of one year.  The fine, if realised, shall be paid to the complainant.  All the accused persons, except  Ram Shankar @ Shankari, Appellant No.4, are directed to be released forthwith, if not required in connection with any other case. Ram Shankar @ Shankari, Appellant No.4, who is on bail, is discharged from the liability of bail bonds.","Six appellants, along with accused Dularey, were convicted by the Trial Court under Section 304 Part-II/149 of the Indian Penal Code.

" J U D G M E N T SEN J. Special leave granted. These  appeals   relate  to  admission  to  the  Second Professional MBBS course in Maharishi Dayanand University by migration  from   other  universities.   The  case   of  the appellants, Ms.  Bhawana  Narula,  Manish  Jain  and  Anjali Hooda,  is   that  they   have  satisfied  the  requirements stipulated  by   the  Medical  Council  of  India  and  also Maharishi Dayanand  University and  were  granted  migration from the  colleges where they were pursuing the MBBS course. They joined Maharishi Dayanand University on the strength of migration granted  by the University. On 4th June, 1994, the appellants received  communication from  Maharishi  Dayanand University that  their applications  for  migration  to  the Second  Professional   MBBS  course  in  Maharishi  Dayanand University had  been granted. On receipt of this intimation, they left  the colleges  in  which  they  were  studying  in Karnataka and  joined Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, since  June,  1994  they  were  pursuing  their  studies  in Maharishi Dayanand University. Some of  the persons, who could not obtain migration to Maharishi Dayanand University from other universities, field writ petitions  challenging the  validity of  the  migration granted to  the appellants.  These writ petitions were heard along  with  the  batch  of  other  cases  relating  to  the migration  to   the  BDS   course  of   Maharishi   Dayanand University. It  appears from  the  affidavit  filed  by  the Registrar on  behalf of  the University  that there  is  one fundamental  difference   in  the   principle  followed   by Maharishi Dayanand  University for  considering the cases of migration of  candidates of  MBBS course  from the manner in which  migration   was  allowed   in  the  BDS  course.  For considering the  case  of  migration  to  MBBS  course,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Maharishi Dayanand  University set up a Committee to examine the cases  of various  students who  were seeking migration. The Committee comprised of :- (a) Professor Ravi Parkash, Head of the Department of Bio-Science, M.D. University, Rohtak. (b) Professor  R.K. Tuteja, Head of the Department of Statistics, M.D. University,. Rohtak. (c) Dr.  S.B. Siwach, Professor & Head, Department of Medicine, Medical College, Rohtak. (d)  Asstt.   Registrar  (R&S),  H.D.  University, Rohtak. The recommendations  made by  the Committee were accepted by the University without making any change at all. There is no allegation of  bias  against  any  of  the  members  of  the Committee. It  has been  stated in the affidavit of Devender Singh, IAS,  Registrar, Maharishi  Dayanand University, that out of  20 eligible students seeking migration, 7 of the top 14 students  in merit were granted migration. Since there is no question of bias of personal animus against any member of the Committee,  it will  not be  fair at  this stage  to set aside the selection made by the Committee. The judgment  of the  High Court  dated 23rd  February, 1995 is  set aside.  It  is  directed  that  the  candidates selected by  the Committee  set up by the Maharishi Dayanand University for  migration  to  the  MBBS    course  will  be entitled  to   pursue  their  studies  in  the  MBBS  course conducted by the Maharishi Dayanand University in accordance with the rules of the University.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R Delay condoned. Appeal admitted. Mr. Ajay Aggarwal, learned counsel, accepts notice for the respondent. The short question which arises in the present case is: Whether ‘Vipul Booster’ is an \023insecticide\024  or whether it is a \023plant growth regularor\024? We have gone through the judgment of the Tribunal.  It has been pointed out on behalf of the Department, rightly, that the assessee has registered the above-mentioned product as \023insecticide\024 with the Directorate of Plant Protection, Ministry of Agriculture, Faridabad and that they have been regularly following all procedures and formalities stipulated under the Insecticide Act, 1968. This aspect has not at all been considered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal has also failed to consider the effect of the -2- issuance of such a certificate under the Insecticide Act, 1968.  It is argued on behalf of the assessee that one of the ingredients of the above product is insecticide and the certificate issued under the Insecticide Act is only with reference to that ingredient only. All these questions will require fresh consideration in accordance with law by the Tribunal. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Tribunal for fresh consideration in accordance with law.

" O R D E R Delay condoned. This special  leave petition has been filed against the remand order  of the  High Court  of Karnataka made on March 25, 1996  in R.S.A. No.196/90. The admitted position is that the first  respondent had entered into an agreement on March 11,1983 to  purchase 3  acres  28  gunthas  of  land  for  a consideration of  Rs.12,000/- and  he had  paid Rs.2000/- as earnest money. The petitioner-second defendant purchased the self-same property  on July  8, 1983  for a consideration of Rs.6000/- and  had  the  sale  deed  registered.  The  first respondent filed  the suit  for  specific  performance.  The trial Court  finding that  the petitioner  had purchased the property and  it would  cause irreparable  damage to  him if decree for  specific performance being would be granted, had directed refund  of the  earnest money  with  interest.  The first respondent carried the matter in appeal. The appellant Court set aside the decree of the trial Court on the finding that the  petitioner had not pleaded that he was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the prior agreement of sale. It  also had  held that the refusal to grant relief of specific performance  on that  ground was  not valid in law. Accordingly, it  reversed the  decree of the trial Court and granted specific performance. In the second appeal, the High Court while upholding the pleading of the respondent that he was ready  and willing  to perform his part of the agreement and that  he had  led the  evidence in that behalf, remitted the matter  to the  district Court  to frame an issue on the basis of the previous judgement and the issue in this behalf was required  to  be  settled.  We  need  not  go  into  the correctness of  the remand  order since the first respondent has not  filed any  SLP against  that order.  Suffice it  to state that the petitioner has no cause for grievance in this matter for remanding the matter. In view of the finding that he is  a subsequent  purchaser, as  found by the trial Court itself, and  that the  High Court has remitted the matter to frame the  issue whether  the first respondent was ready and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 willing to  perform his  part of the contract and decide the matter on the basis of the evidence already on record, we do not think  that there  is any  error of law committed by the High Court in remitting the matter.

" JUDGMENT ORDER Heard learned for the parties. These appeals by special leave are directed against the common judgment and order dated 24.5.2000 passed by a learned Single Judge of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Regular Second Appeal Nos. 42/2000 and 43/2000 whereby the High Court has upheld the order of the Trial Court. The Trial Court had directed that the respondents herein who were working as Tractor Drivers on daily wage basis should be granted the same pay scale as those who had been regularly appointed, on the principle of equal pay for equal work. However, the other relief regarding regularization of their services was declined by the Trial Court and the same was affirmed by the High Court. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court, the State of Punjab is in appeal before us. Special leave was granted by this Court on 17.8.2001 and the execution of the order passed by the High Court was stayed. Today the appeals are before us for final hearing. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court as also of the Trial Court. The principle of equal pay for equal work has gone a sea change. Earlier the view of this Court was that if two persons are discharging the same functions, they will be entitled to same wages. Subsequently this view has been changed and now the view of this Court is that there should be complete and total identity between the two persons similarly situated so as to grant equal pay for equal work. Recently this Court has held that identity between two persons has to be complete and total. In case of a regular appointee, he has undergone a selection process and his services are regular. Even if a daily wage employee is discharging the same functions as a regular employee the authorities are not bound to grant equal pay to such a person who is appointed on daily wage basis, i.e., is appointed for a short term and has not faced the selection process. Thus, the principle of equal pay for equal work has to be granted only if there is a total and complete identity between the two persons. In this view, we are supported by a decision of this Court in the case of S.C. Chandra & Ors. v. State of Jharkhand & Ors., [2007] 9 SCR 130-JT [2007] 10 SC 272, which has referred to earlier decisions of this Court. In the aforesaid decision one of us (Markandey Katju, J.) in his concurring judgment has held that granting pay scale is an executive or legislative function, and not a judicial function. There is separation of powers under the Constitution between the three organs of the State, and the judiciary http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 should not encroach into the domain of the other organs. Montesquieus theory of separation of powers broadly applies in India too. In view of the legal position, as mentioned above, we are of the opinion that the view taken by the High Court granting pay scale of regular employees to the daily wage employees does not appear to be well founded. Consequently, we allow these appeals and set aside the order of the High Court as also of the Trial Court and dismiss the suits filed by the respondents herein. The appeals are allowed. No order as to costs.","The principle of equal pay for equal work has gone a sea change.

The tax is  levied  under  the Andhra  Pradesh Non- Agricultural Lands Assessment Act, 1963 (for  short  the ’Act’).  Before the High Court  Corporation had  challenged  the order of the appellate authority  under the  Act  confirming  the demand issued  for  collection  of non-agricultural  land  tax  for 14 years.  The  demand  was raised  by  Palakole Mandal, West Godavari District,  Andhra Pradesh.

In our Judgment in Civil Appeal No.   7054  of 1995  (Food  Corporation of India vs.  Municipal  Committee, Jalabad  and another), we have held that Corporation  cannot claim  exemption  from  taxation under Article  285  of  the Constitution. Under  Section  3  of the Act for levy  assessment  on agricultural land has to be for each fasli year.  If we look at  the order impugned before the High Court confirming  the demand  for 14 years it is not that assessment was not  made for each fasli year separately.  It is only the demand which has been raised for 14 years.  High Court has held that what Section  3 of the Act enjoins is that a tax shall be  levied and  collected at the rate specified for each fasli year and there  is nothing to warrant the contention that the  demand cannot  be made after the expiry of the fasli year to  which it  relates.  High Court also held that no attempt had  been made  to say that the claim for tax for any particular  year had  become  barred  by time.  We do not find error  in  the reasonings of the High Court.

" JUDGMENT ORDER ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. : Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench. Factual position in a nutshell is as follows : Challenging the order of termination passed by the appellant-Corporation, the respondent (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Employee’) filed a suit for declaration that the termination is bad. The suit was decreed on 03.05.1987. It was held that the order of termination was void ab-initio and non est and that the plaintiff-respondent is in continuity of service of the Corporation. The respondent-employee filed two execution applications. The first one was for salary for the period from January, 1982 to May, 1987. The subsequent execution application was for salary from July, 1987 to March, 1988. It is only the legality of the execution proceedings for the period from April, 1988 to March, 1997 which is in dispute. According to the appellant-Corporation, there was no direction for back wages and merely because the plaintiff managed to get some amount by executing a decree for the previous period, that will not entitle him in law to get back wages for a period during which he had not worked and there was nothing in the decree so far as back wages are concerned. The plea was not accepted by the executing court and the revision petition under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short ‘the CPC’) was also rejected by the High Court by the impugned order. According to learned counsel for the appellant-Corporation, the decree is absolutely silent so far as the back wages are concerned. The decree in essence contains only a declaratory relief without any consequential payment for monetary benefits. That being so, the executing court and the High Court were not justified in granting the relief sought for. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that when the decree clearly indicated that the termination was illegal non est, as a natural corollary, the plaintiff was entitled to the back wages. In an almost identical case, this Court in Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation and Anr. v. Ladulal Mali, [1996] 8 SCC 37 held that the decree does not contain payment of back wages. Only declaratory relief of the nature granted in the present case was granted. Further, in A.P.S.R.T.C. and Anr. v. S. Narsaguod, [2002] 2 SCC 212, in paragraph-9, this Court held as follows : http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ""9. We find merit in the submission so made. There is a difference between an order of reinstatement accompanied by a simple direction for continuity of service and a direction where reinstatement is accompanied by a specific direction that the employee shall be entitled to all the consequential benefits, which necessarily flow from reinstatement or accompanied by a specific direction that the employee shall be entitled to the benefit of the increments earning during the period of absence. In our opinion, the employee after having been held guilty of unauthorized absence from duty cannot claim the benefit of increments notionally earned during the period of unauthorized absence in the absence of a specific direction in that regard and merely because he has been directed to be reinstated with the benefit of continuity in service."" Of course, the above noted case related to the question of granting increments notionally. But the principles laid down relating to specific non-mention about any monetary benefit is relevant. As was noted in the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation’s case (supra) there was no decree for grant of any monetary benefits. Above being the position, the High Court’s order cannot be maintained and is set aside. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. No costs.","High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench.

In this appeal by special leave, the appellant has challenged the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated 21 May, 1999 in Criminal Appeal No.68 of 1989 . The learned judge of the High Court affirmed the judgment and order of the Special Judge, C.B.I. Dated 4th February, 1989 in Special Case No.11/1982 whereby the appellant was found guilty of the offence under Section 409 IPC and sentenced to one year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default to undergo six months rigorous imprisonment and to one year rigorous imprisonment under Section 477A IPC. Though it affirmed the conviction for the offences under Sections 5(1)(c) and 5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1957, no separate sentence was passed. We have gone through the judgment of the High Court as also the judgment of the trial court.  We find that in the judgment of the High Court, there is hardly any discussion of the evidence on record.  This Court has consistently observed that an appeal against an order of conviction preferred by an accused, must be considered by the appellate court, both on quest ions of law and questions of fact.  While the High Court has the power to dismiss a criminal appe al summarily, that power must be exercised only in a case where there is no arguable question o f fact or law. Having gone through the judgments of the High Court and the trial court, we find that the matter requires deeper consideration.  This is not one of those cases where the Hig h Court could have simply affirmed the findings of the trial court without recording reasons. The High Court has observed that the trial court had gone into all details of oral and documentary evidence adduced in the case and it found that the conclusions drawn on the basi s thereof were  absolutely correct and, therefore, the High Court did not feel the need to dis cuss oral and documentary evidence on record, which may only result in repetition.  In our view this approach is perverse. In fact, counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to paragraphs 23 and 24 of the judgment of the trial court and argued that the findings recorded by the trial court cannot be sustained.  We do not wish to consider this submission urged before us, in view of the order , that we propose to pass, lest it may prejudice the case of the parties. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We are firmly of the view that this is  an appeal which requires to be considered by the High Court in detail and the points involved require a close  scrutiny of the oral and documentary evidence on record. In this view of the matter, we set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh hearing by a judge other than th e judge, who decided this appeal. This Court granted bail to the appellant.  He  shall continue on bail till the dispo sal of the appeal by the High Court. Since the matter is an old one, we request the High Court to dispose it of as early as possible. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.","In this appeal by special leave, the appellant has challenged the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated 21 May, 1999 in Criminal Appeal No.68 of 1989.

" WITH SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO.14887 OF 1996 (CC-3212/96) O R D E R Delay condoned. The two  petitioners in  these cases  were recruited as legal assistants  after having  put in  more  than  8  years practice at the Bar. One was recruited on April 24, 1963 and the other  on July  3, 1964.  After  putting  in  qualifying service of  25 years,  they retired from service on June 13, 1989 and  March 31, 1992 respectively. They relied upon Rule 2423-A of  the Railway  Establishment  Mannual  II  claiming addition of  5 years  qualifying service  for computation of their pension.  The Tribunal  in the  impugned orders  dated 6.12.1995 allowed  the applications and computation thereof. The same are assailed in their applications. Rule 2423-A reads thus: ""2423-A (C..S.R.404-B):- An Officer appointed to  a service  or post on or after Ist April, 1968 may add to his    service    qualifying    for superannuation pension (but not for any other  class  of  pension)  the actual period  not  exceeding  one- fourth the length of his service or the actual  period by which his age at the  time of recruitment exceeds twentyfive years  or  a  period  of five years, whichever is the least, if the service or post is one:- (a)   for    which    post-graduate research       or        specialist qualification,  or   experience  in scientific     technological     or professional fields,  is  essential and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (b) to  which  candidates  of  more than twenty  five years  of age are normally recruited. Provided that  this concession shall not be admissible to any such officer    unless     his    actual qualifying service  at the  time he quits  Government  Service  is  not less than ten years. Provided further that any such officer who is recruited at the age of thirtyfive  years or  more  may, within a  period  of  three  months from the  date of  his appointment, elect  to   forego  his  rights  to pension where  under  he  shall  be eligible to  subscribe to the State Railway   Provident   Fund   as   a nonpensionable employee."" The amended rule reads thus: ""The above  Rule was amended as can be seen from the Railway Ministry’s letter No.F(E)III/76  PNI 12  dated 15-11-76,  whereby   an  additional proviso was  added to  the rule  as Under:- Provided  further   that  this concession shall be admissible only if the recruitment rules in respect of the  said service/post contain a specific provision that the service or post  is one  which carries  the benefit of this rule. (2)  A   railway  servant   who  is recruited at the age of thirty-five years or  more, may within a period of three  months from  the date  of his appointment, elect to forgo his right  to   pension,  whereupon  he shall be  eligible to  subscribe to the State Railway Provident Fund as a nonpensionable employee. (3) The  option referred to in sub- rule (2)  once exercised,  shall be final."" Relying upon  this proviso  by later  amendment, it  is contended that  since no  specific provision was made in the conditions of  service  at  the  time  of  appointment.  the respondents are  not entitled to the benefit of the rule, It is not  in dispute  that the  rule came  to  be  amended  in November 15,  1976 long after their appointment, Under these circumstances, the amendment would be prospective. It is not in dispute that this amendment came to be made pursuant to recommendation  made  by  the  III  Pay  Commission  and  on acceptance thereof  the rule came to be amended.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  respondents states that  in spite of his repeated letters written to the respondents he  did not  receive any  response. On April 21, 1995, we  had given  four weeks  time to the counsel for the respondents at  his request. Today also, he has repeated the same and  requested another  chance but  we decline to grant further adjournment. We have  heard learned  counsel for  the appellant. The appellant-plaintiff laid  the suit  for declaration of title and for possession. Her case is found on the undisputed fact that her  father Urddhaba is owner of 88 acres of the plaint property. She  claims that the respondents are not concerned with the  property in  whatsoever  manner  but  remained  in possession. The  respondents set  up the  plea of  adoption. Admittedly, the  predecessor in  interest of  respondents is brother’s son  of the Urddhaba. The trial court accepted the plea of  adoption and  dismissed the  suit. In  First Appeal 196/77, by  judgment and  decree dated December 3, 1992, the learned single judge of the High Court confirmed the decree. Hence, this appeal by special leave. The learned  counsel for  the appellant  contended that the  respondent   in  the  written  statement  pleaded  that Urddhaba was  50 years  old when his first wife Mahadei died and his  second wife had given birth to one daughter and one son who died later. He had requested his natural father, the defendant, to  give adoption.  As a  result  he  became  the adoptive son  of Urddhaba. The first respondent claimed that he was  practically adopted  when he  was one year old child and remained  in the  adopted  family.  The  adopted  father Urddhaba died  in 1938. As a consequence, he claimed to have succeeded to  the father’s estate as a sole son. Counsel for the  appellant   contended  that   this  plea   is   clearly unsustainable when  it is  taken note of is that the natural father had  lost five  children and  the defendant being the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 only son,  it would  be highly  improbable that  the natural father would  lose his  only son and give him in adoption to Urddhaba. He  also contended that from 1912 till 1950, there is no  documentary evidence  to establish that the defendant was an  adopted son  of Urddhaba.  The only  entry is in the electoral roll  of 1950  in which his claim to be the son of Urddhaba, which  could be  at any  rate be  a  self  created document. Reasons  given by  the courts  below  are  clearly unsustainable. He  has drawn  our attention to the statement that Urddhaba  was 35  years old  at the time of adoption in the year  1912 and that was clearly show that Urddhaba would not be inclined to take the first respondent in adoption. In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  respondent  is  not represented by  a counsel  and since  it is  a matter  to be examined in  detail, we  do not feel inclined to go into the facts in this case. The learned counsel stated that there is voluminous documentary  evidence in proof of the appellant’s case and  the High  Court had  not adverted  to the material documentary   evidence   and,   therefore,   case   requires reconsideration. We  deem it appropriate that the High Court would dispose the appeal afresh after giving hearing to both the parties and decide the matter as per law. The appeal  is allowed accordingly and the judgment and decree of  the High  Court  are  set  aside  and  matter  is remitted for early disposal. No costs.",The appellant-plaintiff laid the suit for declaration of title and for possession.

" JUDGMENT ORDER We have heard learned counsel for the parties. This appeal by special leave is directed against the impugned interlocutory order dated 23rd November, 2000 in Writ Petition No. 2209 of 2000 passed by the High Court of Bombay. The prayer in that writ petition was for quashing the order of the Education Inspector, Greater Mumbai dated 30.9.2000. The order dated 30.9.2000 states that since certain appointments of teachers were made by the Dayanand Vedic Vidyalaya, Mumbai in violation of the Rules, approval for such appointments is rejected. In our opinion in such a petition there was no scope for grant of any interim order, and instead the writ petition should have been decided finally at an early date. However, what the High Court has done by the impugned interim order is to direct grant of ad hoc approval to some teachers. This is a strange order passed by the High Court. There is no provision in the rules for grant of ad hoc approval. Either approval is granted, or the prayer is rejected. There is no scope for a half way measure like that adopted by the High Court. We cannot appreciate such kind of interim orders which really amount to grant of final relief. This kind of practice of granting such interim orders should be discontinued and should not be encouraged. However in this appeal against the order of the High Court, this Court on 29th January, 2001 observed that ""the operation of the order under Challenge shall remain stayed unless the order under challenge has already given effect to."" The writ petition is still pending before the High Court of Bombay. We request the High Court to dispose off the matter  finally, if not disposed off so far, preferably within a period of three months from the date on which a copy of this order is received by it. The interim order dated 29th January, 2001 passed by this Court is made absolute, but shall only continue till the final disposal of the writ petition by the High Court.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal at Cuttack  in T. A. No. 267\86  on May 26, 1987. The admitted  facts are that the respondent was working in Hirakund  Project Prior  to 30th  march 1960.  Consequent upon the  closer of the project,  offer was given to several persons including  the respondent  for  seeking  appointment either in  the state  service or  in the Government of India service or  to get  retrenched.  The alternative appointment in the  Government project , namely,  Danakarnya Project was given to the respondent by letter dated March 9, 1960 by the chief  Administrator   of  that  Project.    The  letter  of appointment read as under: ""The post  in question  carries the pay  scale   of   180-10-300...plus usual      dearness      allowances admissible  to  central  Government employees.      In   addition   the following  allowances   have   been sanctioned for the employees of the Dandakarnya Project  and  Sri  Guru Charan Das will be entitled to them in   addition    to   the    extent admissible. (i) 25%  deputation allowance,   if he is  already a  permanent  /quasi permanent  employee,     (ii)   20% Project  allowance  permanent/quasi permanent or  not   (iii) Rent free tenanted accommodation  in the area or the present. 3. In  case the  post is acceptable to Shri  Guru Charan  Das on  these terms and  conditions,  he  may  be relieved from  his duties  so as to as  Publicity  officer  at  Koraput immediately but  act later than 4th April 1960  after availing  joining time, admissible under the rules."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Obviously  the   respondent  accepted   the  offer   of appointment and  in terms  thereof by  letter dated April 2, 1960, he  was appointed  temporarily as Publicity Organiser. Since deputation  allowance was not paid to him,  he filed a writ petition  in the  High  Court.    consequent  upon  the constitution of  the Tribunal,  the writ  petition  was  has found as  a fact  that his continuance in Hirakund as U.D.C. was on  permanent basis  and that, therefore, he is entitled to the deputation allowance. Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant  contends that since the respondent came to be appointed  afresh   on  temporary  basis  in  terms  of  the appointment letter,   he  is not  entitled to the deputation allowance.  We find no force in the contention. In view  of the  offer  of  appointment  given  to  the respondent and  the respondent having accepted the same,  he is entitled  to the   deputation allowance of 25%. Since his status as  a permanent  U.D.C. was  not disputed  before the Tribunal and  no tangible  contra material  has been  placed before    us  justifying  acceptance  of  the  said  finding recorded by  the Tribunal,  the respondent  is  entitled  to deputation allowance as directed by the Tribunal.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  Heard  learned  counsel  for  both  the parties. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  High Court of Andhra Pradesh, made on April 23, 1996 in W.A. No. 179 of 1996. The admitted  position is  that the  appellant and  six others had  been appointed on daily wages to the post of Lab Assistants as  non-teaching staff  of the respondent-private college. They were being paid daily wages. Writ petition and appeal seeking  equal pay  having been  dismissed, they have filed the present appeal for direction to pay them equal pay for equal work on par with the other Government employees. It is not in dispute that executive instructions issued by the Government have given them the right to claim the pay scales so as to be on par with the Government employees. The question is:  when there  is no  statutory values  issued in that behalf,  and the  Institution, at  the  relevant  time, being not  in receipt  of any grant-in-aid; Whether the writ petition under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution  is  not maintainable? In  view of the long line of decisions of this Court holding  that when  there is a interest created by the Government in  a Institution to impart education, which is a fundamental right  of the  citizens, which  is a fundamental right of  the citizens, the teachers who teach the education gets an  element of  public interest  in the  performance of their duties.  As  a  consequence,  the  element  of  public interest requires  to regulate  the conditions of service of those  employees   on  bat  with  Government  employees.  In consequence, are they also not entitled to the parity of the pay  scales   as  per   the  executive  instruction  so  the Government? It  is not  also in dispute that all the persons who filed  the writ  petition along  with the  appellant has later withdrawn  from the  writ petition  and thereafter the respondent-Management paid  the salaries  on  par  with  the Government employees.  Since the  appellants  are  insisting upon  enforcement   of  their  right  through  the  judicial pressure, they  need and  seek the protection of law. we are of the  view  that  the  State  has  obligation  to  provide facilities and  opportunities to  the people to available of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the right  to education.  The private  institutions cater to the needs of the educational opportunities. The teacher duly appointed to  a post  in the  private  institution  also  is entitled to  seek enforcement  of the  orders issued  by the Government. The  question is  as to  which forum  on  should approach. The  High  Court  has  held  that  the  remedy  is available under the Industrial Disputes Act. when an element of  public  interest  is  created  and  the  institution  is catering to  the  element,  the  teacher,  the  arm  of  the institution is also entitled to avail of the remedy provided under Article  226: the  jurisdiction part  is very wide. It would be  different position, if the remedy is a private law remedy. so,  they cannot be denied the same benefit which is available to  others. Accordingly,  we hold  that  the  writ petition is  maintainable. They are entitled to equal pay so as to  be on  par with  Government employees  under  Article 39(d) of the Constitution.

" JUDGMENT ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. These two appeals relate to a claim made by Ramu Pasi (respondent No. 2) under the Workmen’s Compensation ACt, 1923 (in short ’the Act’). Adjudicating the claim made by the said Ramu Pasi claiming compensation under the Act for an alleged injury suffered on 11.06.1986, the Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Dhanbad (in short ’the Labour Court’) awarded compensation of Rs. 4001. The injury, on the left ring finger, according to the claimant was suffered when he was working in the factory of the appellant. An appeal was preferred before the Patna High Court under Section 30 of the Act taking the stand that Ramu Pasi is not covered by the expression ’workman’, as defined in Section 2(n) of the Act and, therefore, his claim petition before the Labour Court was not maintainable. Since, the Labour Court recorded a finding that the applicant Ramu Pasi was engaged as a casual worker, it should not have entertained the claim petition. Further, the employee was not employed for the purposes of the employer’s trade and business. Learned Single Judge was of the view that the said question was really of an academic interest because the quantum awarded was very small. A Letters Patent Appeal was preferred before the Division Bench, which came to be dismissed on the ground that the same was not maintainable. In these appeals, the order of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench are assailed. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that after having recorded a categorical finding that the claimant was a casual worker, his application for grant of compensation under the Act should not have been accepted. Ms. K. Sarada Devi, learned Amicus-Curiae, on the other hand submitted that considering the small quantum, this is not a fit case for our interference. Further the Labour Court having considered the nature of work rendered by the respondent, entertained the claim petition. In order to appreciate the rival submissions, it is necessary to take note of Section 2(n) of the Act, as it stood at the relevant point of time. At that time, Section 2(n) of the Act read as follows: ""Section 2(n) ""workman"" means any person (other than a person whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer’s trade or business) who is - (i) a railway servant as defined in Section 3 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (9 of 1890), not permanently employed in any administrative, district or sub-divisional office of a railway and not employed in any such capacity as it specified in Schedule II, or (ii) employed on monthly wages not exceeding (one thousand rupees) in any such capacity as is specified in Schedule II. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Whether the contract of employment was made before or after the passing of this Act and whether such contract is expressed or implied, oral or in writing; but does not include any person working in the capacity of a member of (the Armed Forces of the Union) and any reference to a workman who has been injured shall, where the workman is dead includes a reference to his dependants or any of them."" A bare reading of the said Act shows that the expression ’workman’ as defined in the Act does not cover a casual worker. There was also no definite material adduced to show that the claimant was employed for the purposes of the employer’s trade or business. That being so, the application before the Labour Court was clearly not maintainable. To that extent, the Labour Court and the High Court were not correct in their view. But considering the small quantum awarded, we direct that the amount, if already paid to the claimant, shall not be recovered. In the event, the money has not been paid to the claimant, the same shall be paid forthwith. If it is on deposit, it shall be permitted to be withdrawn by the claimant. The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of.","Ramu Pasi made a claim under the Workmen’s Compensation ACt, 1923 (in short ’the Act’).

" O R D E R Leave granted. Heard Counsel on both sides. The facts  are that  the respondents  were  engaged  on daily wages  on muster roll basis in Central Scheme and were paid out of the funds provided by the Central Government. It is stated  that after  the Scheme  was closed their services were dispensed  with. When  the respondents  filed the  writ petition in  the High  Court, the  High Court  gave  interim direction on  November  18,  1992  and  directed  their  re- engagement  elsewhere.   Against   the   aforesaid   interim direction, this appeal by special leave has been filed. It is  seen that  when the  project  is  completed  and closed due  to non-availability of funds, the employees have to go  along with  its closure. The High Court was not right in giving  the direction  to regularise  them or to continue them  in  other  places.  No  vested  right  is  created  in temporary  employment.   Directions  cannot   be  given   to regularise their  services in  the absence  of any  existing vacancies nor can directions be given to the State to create posts in a non-existent establishment. The Court would adopt pragmatic approach  in  giving  directions.  The  directions would amount  to  creating  of  posts  and  continuing  them despite  non-availability   of  the  work.  We  are  of  the considered view that the directions issued by the High Court are absolutely  illegal  warranting  our  interference.  The order of the High Court is, therefore, set side.

" O R D E R The petitioners  were appointed as Field Workers in the Filaria Department  of the State Government between 1981 and 1985. In  the first  instance, they had fixed W.P. No.250/92 and the High Court directed the Government to consider their representation and  dispose it  of by judgment dated January 18, 1993.  When they came to this Court, this Court directed the Government  to consider  their cases in the Right of the law laid  down by  this Court  in State of Haryana Vs. Piara Singh [(1932) 4 SCC 118]. Subsequently, since the Government had not  taken any steps, the petitioners fixed another writ petition. In  the meanwhile,  the Public  Service Commission [PSC]  had  selected  the  candidates  who  were  not  being appointed. Therefore,  the  selectees  approached  the  High Court and  filed the  writ petition.  The  petitioners  also filed the  writ petition  in  the  High  Court  seeking  for regularisation. The  High Court  in the impugned order dated June 24,  1996 in  O.P. No.  17422/93 dismissed the batch of writ petitions  filed by  the petitioners  allowed one  writ petitions filed by the selectees and directed the Government to appoint  the candidates selected through the PSC. It also directed the  Government to  send the requisition to the PSC to fill  up the  posts of  30 vacancies from the list of the selected candidates  prepared by  the PSC. Thus this special leave petition. It is  bought to  be contended  by Mr.  M.M.  Paikedav, learned senior counsel for the petitioners that in the light of the law laid down by this Court in Piara Singh’s case and in  view   of  the  fact  that  the  petitioners  have  been continuing for  more than  14 years, they are required to be regularised. We find no force in the contention. Admittedly, the posts  are to  be filled  up through  selection  by  PSC recruitment norms.  Necessarily, therefore,  the requisition was sent  for selection  through the PSC and candidates came to be  selected. Under  those circumstances, the candidates, who were  found eligible  and selected  and recommended  for appointment by  the PSC,  were required to be appointed. The http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court rightly  had  exercised  the  power  in  declining  to regularise the services of the petitioners. The learned counsel sought to rely upon an order of the Government where  the Government  had decided  to regularise the services of the employees. Obviously, since the decision runs into  the teeth  of statutory requirement under Article 320 of  the Constitution  the  Government  cannot  take  any decision contrary  to the  Constitution  to  regularise  the services of the candidates de hors the recruitment rules and the statutory  process for  selection through  the PSC.  The High Court,  therefore, has  rightly given  direction to the Government to notify 30 vacancies and odd or whatever may be the  vacancies   existing  to   fill  up  from  amongst  the candidates selected by the PSC. It is  then contended  that the petitioners have turned over-aged and,  therefore, necessary  direction may be given to regularise  their service  by  filling  up  the  unfilled posts. Even  that relief  also cannot  be  granted.  If  the petitioners  have   turned  over-aged   on   the   date   of recruitment, it  would be  for the appropriate Government to relax the  age requirement and the petitioners have to stand in the  queue and  get selection  through the PSC. Thus that they get in only the right to appointment to the post. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","The petitioners were appointed as Field Workers in the Filaria Department of the State Government between 1981 and 1985.

" O R D E R Leave granted. On the admitted facts, the approach of both the learned single Judge  and of the Division Bench in the writ petition and the  W.A. No.  1358/95 indicated  in the  impugned order made   on January 30, 1996 cannot be sustained. Notification under Section  4(1) of  the Land  Acquisition Act.  1894 was published on June 4, 1987 acquiring the land in question for the public  purpose. After  compliance of  the notice  under Sections 9 and 10 of the Act and enquiring the award came to be passed by the land Acquisition Office on February 7,1990. The possession thereafter was taken on October 30, 1990. The question, therefore,  would be  what  would  be  the  proper procedure to  be adopted, in case of dispute as to the title of the  land acquired  under the  Act ?  The learned  single Judge declared  title of the petitioner in the writ petition and the  Division Bench  directed civil  Court to decide the title. Both  views are  obviously erroneous in law. The Land Acquisition Officer has to determine the extent of the land, the persons  entitled to  compensation and  the compensation to be  determined under  Section 23  (1) of  the Act.  If he finds that  there is  any dispute  as to  person entitled to receive the  compensation, necessarily he has to deposit the amount under  Section 31  of the Act into the Court to which reference would lie. On such a dispute having arisen, he has to make a reference to the Court under Section 30 of the Act to decide  the dispute between the Competing persons who set up  rival   title   to   the   compensation.   Under   those circumstances,  the   only  legal  course  open  is  that  a direction be  issued to the Land Acquisition Officer to make a reference under Section 30 to decide the inter se title to receive the  compensation either  by the appellant or by the 4th respondent,  as the  case may be and the reference Court would decide the matter in accordance with law.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court made on July 29, 1991 in  Writ Petition  No.2333/83. The admitted position is that one  Hanumanbux had  been running salt works at Bombay. It had  established salt  factory at  Bhandup Circle on land admeasuring 138  acres 17  gunthas and  seabed etc.  on  the basis of  a lease which was due for renewal on July 1, 1983. When a  notice was issued by the appellants on June 30, 1983 calling upon the licensees to execute a lease deed admitting the title of the appellants, they resisted the action in the above writ  petition. The  High Court  in the impugned order stated that  whether  the  respondents  are  owners  of  the property  or   a  lessees   and  consequently   whether  the Government can  compel the  licensees to  concede  to  their title are  jurisdictional issues.  Since the  Collector  had already decided  that  the  respondents  had  title  to  the property, which is a condition for grant of a valid licence, it was  for the  Government to  consider the  renewal of the licensees provided  all the requisite conditions for renewal of the  licence were complied with. We are informed that the appeal has  already been  filed against  the  order  of  the Collector and  is pending.  It is for the Government to have the matter disposed of. It is  not in  dispute that for grant of renewal, title to the  property or  title under  a  lease  is  a  condition precedent. The Government asserted its title to the property and called  upon the  respondents to  accept their title and have a  licence issued  from them.  On the  other hand,  the respondents asserted  to have  title  to  the  property  and claimed that  they had a right under the order passed by the Collector which  is subject  matter in  the appeal. The High Court, therefore,  rightly has not gone into the question of title and  relegated the  parties to  the  decision  of  the appellate  Tribunal   and  to  take  action  in  furtherance http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 thereof. The view taken by the High Court, therefore, cannot be said to be unjustified on the facts of the case. However, it will  be subject  to the  result in  the appeal  and  the action of  the appellants  would be  in furtherance thereof. Until then, the interim order passed by the High Court would continue.

" J U D G M E N T NANAVATI. J. Even though  in the  Cause Title  of  the  Appeal  five persons are shown as respondents, it has to be treated as an appeal against  three respondents  only, as  the  respondent Nos. 2  and 3  had died  during the  pendency of  the appeal before the High Court. The three  respondents were  tried along  with  Jagdish Singh and  Jay Narayan  for the  offences  punishable  under Sections 148 and 302 IPC for causing death of Ram Bharose on 16.2.1982  at  11.00  a.m.  The  trial  court  believed  the evidence of P.W. 4 Rewa who was with Ram Bharose at the time of the  incident and  also of  P.W. 3 Ram Avtar who had seen the incident while standing near the house of Kishan Lal and convicted all  the five  accused under  Section 148  and 302 IPC. All  the five  convicted accused filed an appeal before the High  Court. Accused Jay Narayan and Jagdish died during the pendency  of the  appeal and,  therefore,  their  appeal abated. The  High Court on reappreciation of the evidence of P.W. 3  Ram Avtar  and P.W.  4 Rewa  Ram held that they were present at  the time of the occurrence and could be accepted as truthful  witnesses. The  High Court,  therefore,  relied upon their  evidence and held that the accused had assaulted Ram Bharose  High Court,  however,  did  not  confirm  their conviction under  Section 302  IPC for the reason that there was no charge against them that the death of Ram Bharose was cause, in  furtherance of  the common object of the unlawful assembly of  which they  were the  members. The  High Court, therefore, held  that they  could be held quality only under Section 326  IPC   common object  was to assault Ram Bharose and commit rioting with deadly weapons. We have also gone through the evidence of P.W. 3 and 4. From their  evidence it  is not  possible to say which fatal injury was  caused by  which accuse.  The two witnesses have specifically referred to only about 8 to 10 injuries whereas on the  person of  Ram Bharose  as many  as 51 injuries were found. As  it was  not possible  to hold  who had caused the fatal  injury  to  the  deceased,  the  High  Court  rightly convicted them under Section 326 IPC.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel for the parties. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  of the  High Court  of  Punjab  &  Haryana  dated 19.12.1996 made in CWP No. 18180 of 1996. The admitted  position is  that pursuant to the charge- sheet  dated   1.6.1996  issued   to  the   respondent,   on 20.11.1996, the  Enquiry officer  rejected permission to the respondent to  engage Shri  Kamal Kumar, a retired employee, as a  defence assistant  in the  enquiry. The respondent was asked to  appear either  in person or through an employee of the  Corporation  or  a  Central  Government  or  the  State Government employee  to defend  himself, The  respondent did not appear.  On the  other hand, he filed a writ petition in the High  Court  contending  that  he  is  entitled  to  the assistance of  a retired employee of the Food Corporation of India.  The  High  Court  allowed  the  writ  petition  with direction to  the corporation  to allow  the  respondent  to engage the  retired  employee  as  defence  assistance.  The question is:  whether the  High Court is right in giving the direction? It  is true  that in  an enquiry conducted by the Department, the  delinquent  is  entitled  to  a  reasonable opportunity to  defend himself  including the  assistance of the employee of the Corporation or of the Central Government or the  State Government  employee. Rule  58(8) of  the Food Corporation of  India Staff Regulations, which postulates as under: ""58(8) The  employee may  take  the assistant of  any other employee of the Corporation  or  any  State  or Central  Government   employee   to present the case on his behalf, but may not engage a legal practitioner for   the    purpose   unless   the Presenting Officer appointed by the Disciplinary authority  is a  legal practitioner, or,  the disciplinary authority,  having  regard  to  the circumstances  of   the  case,   so http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 permits.""

A  legal practitioner  is prohibited  to  appear before   the    Disciplinary    Authority.    Under    these circumstances, a  direction given by the High Court to allow the respondent to take the assistance of a retired employee, though he  is not  a legal practitioner who is prohibited to appear and  assist the  delinquent, in  reality  amounts  to permitting the  retired employee  to have  regular practice, The High  Court has  committed an  error in  giving  such  a direction. However, It  is stated  that pursuant  to the direction given by  the  High  Court,  the  assistance  of  a  retired employee was already given and the enquiry was completed.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment of  the Division  Bench of  the Kerala  High Court, made on July 24,1991 Writ Appeal No.86 of 1990. The admitted  position is  that an extent of 1.94 acres of land  was acquired  way back  in 1952 for construction of national highway.  The construction  was completed  in 1955. out of  the extent of 1.94 acres, 80 cents of land were used and the  balance land  remained unused. When respondent No.1 had applied  for sale  of the  property  by  dated  December 21,1979, the  property was  sought to  be sold to him at the same rate  at which  compensation was  awarded under Section 11, that  was interdicted  by way  of  writ  petitions.  The sheet-anchor of  the Government to sustain the action is the executive order  issued by the Government for permission for alienation of  the land.  The High  Court has  declared  the executive action  as invalid in the light of the Kerala Land Assignment Act,  1960 (Act  30  of  1960)  (for  short,  the ‘Act’). The  high court  has pointed out that the assignment is in contravention of the Act. Thus, this appeal by special leave. In view  of admitted  section that the land in question was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, it stood vested in the  State  free  from  all  encumbrances.  The  question emerges: whether  the Government  can assign the land to the erstwhile owners?  It is  settled law  that land is acquired for a  public purpose  was achieved,  the rest  of the  land could be  used for  any other  purpose. In  case there is no other public  purpose for  which the  land is  needed,  then instead of  disposal by  way of sale to the erstwhile owner, the land  should be  put to  public auction  and the  amount Fetched in the public auction can be better utilised for the public purpose  envisaged in  the  Directive  Principles  of Constitution. In  the present case, what we find is that the executive order  is not  in consonance with the provision of the  Act   and   is,   therefore,   invalid.   under   these circumstances, the  Division  Bench  is  well  justified  in declaring  the   executive  order   as   invalid.   whatever assignment  is   made,  should  be  for  a  public  purpose. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 otherwise, the  land of  the Government  should be sold only through the  public actions  so that  the public  also  gets benefited by getting higher value.

" JUDGMENT SEMA, J. The appellant alongwith 7 accused were put to trial under Sections 302 IPC and 201 read with 34 IPC. Six accused were acquitted by the trial court. The appellant was convicted under Sections 302 IPC and 201 read with 34 IPC and sentenced to R.I. for life under Section 302 IPC. The appellant was also convicted under Section 201/34 IPC and sentenced to R.I. for five years and a fine of Rs. 2,000, in default further R.I. for six months’. The other accused was also convicted under Section 201 read with 34 IPC and was sentenced to four years’ R.I. and a fine of Rs. 1,000, in default further three months’ R.I. It appears that he has already undergone the sentence and conviction recorded against him. This appeal is filed by the accused Anantalal Ghosh who was convicted under Section 302/201/34 IPC by special leave. Admittedly, there is no eye-witness to the occurrence. The conviction is based on the circumstantial evidence. Both the trial court and the High Court recorded the conviction against the appellant on the basis of the evidence of PW.1, PW.2 and PW.3. It is now established principle of law that the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis except that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence. The High Court on re-appreciation of the evidence found following circumstances well established against the appellant : 1. That it was the fact that the deceased Lilabati bore marks of certain injuries which has been stated in the evidence of PW.1 and mentioned in FIR (Ext.1) corroborated by the evidence of PW.3 and PW.4. 2. That the evidence of Pws .2, 3 and 4 with regard to the fact that they were threatened to leave the place and the body of Lilabati was hurriedly taken for cremation. 3. That the fact that no information was given to the police and the police could not see the dead body. 4. That PW.8 was sent by the mother of the appellant to inform PW.1 and his parents that Lilabati was attacked by diarrhea and the body was kept till the time of their arrival does not establish that the Lilabati died of diarrhea. 5. That PW.2 in his evidence stated that he learnt from the appellant that there was an altercation between the appellant and Lilabati and a rope on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 her waist was found below a Krishnachura tree. This testimony of PW.2 could not be shaken in the cross-examination. 6. That the statement of PW.2 has been well corroborated by the statements of Pws.3 and 4. 7. That the appellant and the deceased Lilabati spent a night together previous to the date of incident and seizure of the rope under the Seizure List (Ext.2). 8. It is well within the knowledge of the appellant and who only could explain the circumstances leading to the cause of death of Lilabati. 9. Last but not the least, the conduct of the appellant in cremating the dead body of the deceased hurriedly before the arrival of the police, when relatives went to call the police after noticing the injury marks on the body of the deceased. All these circumstances appearing against the appellant remain unimpeached. In our view, the testimony of Pws.2, 3 and 4 alongwith other incriminating materials relied upon by the prosecution taken cumulatively would consistently point to the guilt of the accused and inconsistence with his innocence. In our view, the prosecution has been able to establish the chain of circumstances beyond all reasonable doubt consistently pointing out to the guilt of the accused. In the reasons aforestated, we find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed.","The appellant along with 7 accused were put to trial under Sections 302 IPC and 201 read with 34 IPC.

" The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AHMADI,  J.- The grievance of the respondent-association  in the  High Court related to charging of compound interest  on loans given to its members for the purchase of tractors. 2.   The Division Bench of the High Court of Orissa presided over  by  the  then  learned Chief  Justice  held  that  the agreement entered into by the bank with the borrower did not stipulate the payment of compound interest and hence it  was unnecessary to examine if there existed such a  stipulation, the  same  would  have been enforceable by  the  Bank.   See paragraph  13 of the judgment.  It is true that in the  body of the judgment reference has been made to the case of  Bank of India v. Karnam Ranga Rao1 and it is observed that  since farmers do not have regular source of income other than sale proceeds  of  their  crops, and receive  the  sale  proceeds annually,  they  cannot be expected to have  agreed  to  pay interest  with  periodical  rests.  In paragraph  8  of  the judgment the High Court has observed : ""The present, therefore, is a case which would make  the finding of the Karnataka High  Court relevant  insofar as the policy  circulars  of the Reserve Bank of India are concerned."" But  the  High  Court ultimately decided in  favour  of  the borrower  because in its view the agreement did not  provide for  periodical  rests nor did it stipulate for  payment  of compound  interest,  making  the  above-quoted  observations obiter dicta.  In that view of the matter, we see no  reason to interfere as the decision does not ultimately rest on the aforequoted view based on the Karnataka High Court decision. We  may  incidentally say that we have today by  a  separate judgment’  dismissed  the  Bank’s appeal  against  the  said decision.

" O R D E R We have heard learned counsel. Under Section  95(3) of  the West  Bengal  Co-operative Societies Act,  1983 any  claim  which  arises  between  the society and  its members  etc. is required to be laid within two months  from the  date of  the notice  for  arbitration. Notice was  given on October 26, 1974 and the suit was filed on the  original side  of the  Civil Court  on September 10, 1975. Under sub-section (3) of Section 95, if an application is filed  explaining properly  the delay, the Court has been given power for condoning the delay. The High Court has held ultimately that the proceedings laid in the original side of the suit  is not maintainable. However, since the petitioner was bona fide prosecuting the claims before the Civil Court, under Section  14 of the Limitation Act, the said period may be condoned.  On an  application having  been properly made, since the  application came  to be  filed, the Registrar has dismissed the  petition  saying  that  explanation  was  not properly given  and, therefore,  he refuse  to  condone  the delay, The  writ petition  was dismissed  in Civil Order No. 346/1993 dated  August  12,1996.  Thus,  this  special  lave petition. Shri R.C.  Verma, learned  counsel for  the petitioner, contends that  the High  Court having  held that  since  the petitioner was  bona fide prosecuting the proceedings, under Section 14,  the time  spent for  that  purpose  has  to  be excluded, the Registrar was wrong in refusing to condone the delay. We  find no  force in  the contention. From September 10, 1975 till the date of disposal of the matter in the High Court on  the civil  side, by  operation  of  the  direction issued by  the High  court under  Section 14 of the Act, the said period  stands excluded.  However, the  explanation for period of  delay from  September 10,1975  till the date when civil suit came to be filed is required to be explained. The limitation prescribed  is  only  two  months  after  notice. Unless proper  explanation is  given. the valuable right has been created in favour of the respondents under section 3 of the limitation  Act, it  is the  duty of the Court to ensure that unless  proper explanation  is given the valuable right cannot be defeated. Considered from this perspective, the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Registrar was right in not condoning the delay.

Miss Lily Thomas, for Respondent No. 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY,  J. We  are  very  unhappy  about  the judgment of  the  High  Court.  Both  the  respondents  were convicted by  the learned First Additional Sessions Judge of Kurukshetra under s. 302 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code and  each of them was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.  On appeal,  for very  strange reasons,  the  High Court acquitted  the  first  respondent  and  converted  the conviction of  the second respondent to one under s 304-A.I. P. C.  and reduced  the  sentence  to  two  years’  rigorous imprisonment. What  the High  Court said  speaks for itself. This is what the High Court said: ""However, we  are told  by the learned counsel for the  parties  that  they  being  closely  related  some members of the village have intervened and have brought about some  sort of  arrangement under  which Ram Kumar appellant has  already made  a gift  of three  acres of land in  favour of  Smt. Maya  Devi  widow  of  Chander Shekhar as  compensation on account of the loss of life of her      husband.  Though this is not a matter which can be taken notice of by this Court, yet it has always been our  desire  to  see  that  enmity  between  close relations should be encouraged to come to an end. Since the father  of Ramesh Kumar (P.W. 6) had lost his life, he could possibly have indulged in some exaggeration to magnify   the   nature   of   the   offence.   In   the circumstances, we  give benefit  of doubt  to Ram Kumar appellant and  acquit him. We convert the conviction of Ratna appellant from one under section 302 to one under section 304-A,  Indian Penal  Code and  Sentence him to undergo  to   years  rigorous  imprisonment  Ram  Kumar appellant  is  on  bail.  His  bail  bond  shall  stand discharged."" We can only say that the judgment of the High Court has left us  shocked and  perplexed. We  are at  a total loss to understand  it.  The  entire  system  of  administration  of Criminal justice is reduced to a mockery. If the judgment of the High  Court is  upheld, it  is as  if a  person who  can afford to  make gifts  of land  or money to the heirs of the victim may get away even with a charge of murder. 642 Courts  are  to  dispense  justice,  not  to  dispense  with justice. And,  justice to  be  dispensed  is  not  palm-tree justice or idiosyncratic justice. The judgment can not stand a second’s  scrutiny. It  is accordingly  set aside  and the matter is  remanded to  the High  Court so that the Criminal appeals and  revision may  be  reheard.  On  behalf  of  the accused a  very curious  request was  made,  that  the  land gifted by  the father  of the  accused to  the widow  of the deceased may be directed to be returned to the father of the accused. We  take no  notice of  the gift  and we reject the request. H.S.K.

" ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition No. 5858 of 1983. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India) G.L. Sanghi,  M.T. Siddiqi  and  Irfan  Ahmed  for  the Petitioners. Anil Dev  Singh,  C.  Ramesh,  K.  Swami  and  Miss  A. Subhashini for the Respondents. The following order of the Court was delivered: O R D E R The Petitioner  is a  member of  Delhi Higher  Judicial Service, at  present working  as Additional  district Judge. The petitioner  was  directly  recruited  to  service  as  a Scheduled Castes  candidate. He has approached this Court by means of  this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution with a  grievance that  the High Court of Delhi has acted in an unreasonable  manner in refusing to grant selection grade to him  on more  than one occasion. A number of other allied questions were  raised during  the course  of arguments  but ultimately on  behalf of  the petitioner  only the grievance relating to the refusal of selection grade was pressed. Having heard  learned counsel  for  the  parties  at  a length and  having perused  the records  and also the annual confidential reports  awarded to  the petitioner  and  other papers produced  on behalf  of the  High Court,  we find  it difficult to hold that the High Court has acted unreasonably in refusing  to grant  selection grade  to  the  petitioner. Admittedly grant  of selection  grade was  considered on the criteria of  merit to  the members  of Delhi Higher Judicial Service.  Whenever   a  post  in  the  selection  grade  was available the  High Court  considered the  petitioner  along with other officers but on a comparative assessment of merit of eligible  officers, it  granted selection  grade  to  the officers who  were junior  to the  petitioner  and  in  that process the  petitioner stood superseded. Where promotion to higher grade  or post is made on the criteria of merit, many a time  junior officer  is bound  to supersede his senior in the process  of assessment  of comparative  merit, which may result in  supersession of  a senior officer. This cannot be helped since  the petitioner’s  case was considered on merit along with others. and as 615 the High  Court found  officers  junior  to  the  petitioner suitable for  grant of  selection grade the petitioner could not be  selected. We  find no illegality in the High Court’s orders. However, we  would like to refer one aspect which needs consideration. On  a perusal  of the  confidential character roll entries  and other  papers produced before us on behalf of the  High Court,  we find  that since  March 1979 to July 1980 the monthly statement of work done by the petitioner as assessed by the High Court on the basis of the report of the District Judge  shows that the High Court rated his work and conduct as  ""good"" and for the years 1982-83, 1983-84, 1984- 85, 1985-86  and 1986-87 the petitioner has been awarded ’B’ grading. No  doubt he  has not  earned ’A’  grading but  the confidential reports  show that  he is  an  honest  officer. Integrity  of  a  judicial  officer  is  a  great  asset  to administration of  justice, it must be given due weight. The petitioner comes from a weaker section of the society and he has been  found to  be an  honest officer,  this fact  needs consideration. In our opinion the High Court should consider the petitioner’s  case  sympathetically  for  the  grant  of selection grade in the light of our observations at the next http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 selection. Writ petition is disposed of accordingly, there will be no order as to costs. N.V.K.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The appellant  filed a  writ petition in the High Court seeking for a writ of mandamus directing the Commissioner of Police  or   the  appropriate   authority  to  transfer  his complaint dated  April 23,  1991  for  investigation  by  an independent police  agency other  than the local police. The High Court dismissed the writ petition summarily on November 3, 1992. Thus this appeal by Special Leave. We have  heard  the  learned  counsel  on  both  sides. Unfortunately the  appellant was done to death and the trial with regard  to  his  murder  is  pending  decision  in  the appropriate Sessions  Court. Therefore,  we need not go into the merits  in that behalf . The grievance of the appellant- Late  Sri  Kaptan  Singh  was  that  he  was  the  owner  of properties mentioned  in the writ petition; when he was kept in the  police custody  in connection with the crime imputed to him,  some person  holding himself  to be  his  power  of attorney was alienating his property and was including third parties into possession. In spite of his repeated complaints made to the authorities, after collusion of the local police in those  activities, no  action in that behalf was taken by the police  officer. It  would appear  that earlier  to  the complaint  made   by   the   petitioner-appellant   to   the Commissioner of  Police, the  local  police  seems  to  have investigated and  a report in that behalf was sent which now filed as  Annexure 1  & 2  to the counter affidavit sworn by one Alok  Kumar, D.C.P., South Delhi. It would indicate that the dispute  is one  of acute  disputed questions  of  fact. Under  these   circumstances,   we   cannot   satisfactorily adjudicate the  dispute in  this appeal. Therefore, we leave open  the   controversy  relegating  the  appellant’s  legal representative of  Sri  Kaptan  Singh  to  have  the  matter adjudicated  in   an  appropriate   forum.  The  appeal  is, therefore, dismissed but in the circumstance without costs. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","Appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court seeking for a writ of mandamus directing the Commissioner of Police to transfer his complaint.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.3112 of 2006) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the orders passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealing with the appellants’ application in terms of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ’Cr.P.C.’) in Criminal Case No. 27303-M of 2006.  The First Information Report (in short ’FIR’) was lodged against the appellants and others for their alleged involvement in mis-appropriation of stock.  According to the appellants, the dispute essentially revolves around contractual liability and is of a civil nature.  In an arbitration proceeding the matter is under examination.  The High Court by order dated 8th May, 2006 granted interim protection in terms of Section 438 Cr.P.C. on the condition that a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- shall be deposited with Markfed i.e. the complainant in the case. Subsequently because of non-deposit of the amount as directed, notwithstanding the issuance of notice by this Court the protection was denied and prayer in terms of Section 438 Cr.P.C. was rejected. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that in view of the decision of this Court in Bal Kishan Das v. P.C. Nayar [1991 Suppl. (2) SCC 412] the proceedings are not maintainable and the condition of depositing a huge sum of Rs.10,00,000/- as directed by the High Court cannot stand scrutiny in law. Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted that a huge loss was caused to the complainant because of the conspiracy of the appellants and other employees of the complainant.  This is basically not a case of civil dispute and even if arbitration proceedings are in progress, that cannot stand in the way of the criminal proceedings, can be pursued. We find that the High Court has not considered the relevant aspects and has also not indicated any reason as to why it felt necessary to direct deposit of Rs.10,00,000/-. Further the ambit of Section 438 Cr.P.C. as delineated by this Court has not been kept in view. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In the circumstances, we set aside the orders of the High Court dated 8.5.2006 and 7.8.2006 and remit the matter to it for fresh consideration.  Needless to say while dealing with the matter the High Court shall keep in view the principles indicated by this Court relating to  Section 438 in Adri Dharan Das v. State of W.B. [2005 (4) SCC 303] and the relevance and applicability of the decision in Bal Kishan Das’s case (supra) while dealing with the application in terms of Section 438 Cr.P.C. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","Appeal is to the orders passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealing with the appellants’ application in terms of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

" ORDER 1.   A notification under Section 4 of the Land  Acquisition Act,  1994,  was published on Feb. 15, 1979,  acquiring  4.5 acres   of  land  for  establishing  a  Milk   Chilling-cum- Demonstration  Centre  at  Village  Sardulgarh  in  Bhatinda District  of Punjab State.  The Land Acquisition Officer  in his  award  dated  March  23, 1979, awarded  a  sum  of  Rs. 13,816/-  per  acre  as  compensation.   On  reference,  the Additional  District Judge, Bhatinda, by decree dated  April 30  1981,  enhanced the compensation to Rs.  2,50,000/-  per acre.   On  appeal under Section 54 by the State,  the  High Court  in  R.F.A. No. 1065 of 1981 and batch, by  its  order dated  September  15,  1982,  reduced  the  compensation  to Rs.30,000/- per acre.  Dissatisfied with the judgment of the High  Court, the appellants filed these appeals  by  special leave. 2.   Shri  Prem Malhotra, learned counsel appearing for  the appellants,  has  strenuously contended that  the  sale-deed (Ex.Al to A5) and Mutation Proceedings (Ex.A7 to A16)  would show  that the market value ranged between  Rs3,12,000/-  to Rs.  1,08,000/-.  He submitted that the High Court  was  not justified in relying upon the solitary mutation  proceedings noted  in  the  judgment to determine  the  compensation  at Rs.30,000/per  acre, We find no -force in  this  contention. It  is  seen that under the unamended Act, by  operation  of Section  9,  the claimant or the owner is enjoined  to  make claim  giving particulars of the claim.  Section 25  of  the Act,  as originally stood, provided that in a case  where  a claim is made the amount awarded by the court shall not  ex- ceed  the amount claimed or less than the amount awarded  by the Collector under Section 11. This is by operation of sub- section (1) of Section 25.  But in case where the claim  was not made, sub-section (2) operated and held the field.  Sub- section (2) Section 25 read thus : ""When  the applicant has refused to make  such http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 claim or has omitted without sufficient reason (to  be  allowed by the Judge)  to  make  such claim,  the amount awarded by the Court  shall in  no case exceed the amount awarded  by  the Collector."" Thus, it can be seen that in a case where the applicant  had omitted   to  make  the  claim,  then  the  court  had   not jurisdiction 88 to award the compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collector.  In these cases, no claim had been admittedly made by the appellants. 3.This provision was not noted by the High Court.  The  High Court, by referring to the mutation proceedings in which the market  value was shown to be ranging between Rs.9,400/-  to Rs.  14,000/-  per  acre had enhanced  the  compensation  to Rs.30,000/-  per  acre.  That appeal was allowed  to  become final;  and so nothing can be done with the market value  as fixed by the High Court.  But these appeals are dismissed in view  of the statutory prohibition contained in  sub-section (2) Section 25 of the Act.  We make no order as to costs. 89","A notification under Section 4 of the Land  Acquisition Act, 1994,  was published on Feb. 15, 1979, acquiring 4.5 acres of land for establishing a Milk   Chilling-cum- Demonstration Centre.

One  of  the  members  of  the  committee suggested was  Additional District  Judge. The  Bombay  High Court was  requested to  ensure that  an Additional District Judge be  made available  for enforcing the schemes in every agglomeration, so  that the  Committee  constituted  by  the State Government  would effectively  implement the  schemes. This Court  also impressed  upon every  Committee to  ensure fulfillment of  the laudable  purpose of providing a home to the poor  homeless  to  effectuate  its  commitment  to  the constitutional goal  and that every effort should be made by it  to   ensure  that   the  builder  does  not  succeed  in frustrating  the   purpose.  The   State  Government  should suitably modify  its scheme  in the  light of  the  judgment rendered in  Shantistar Builders’  case and  recirculate the same to all concerned within four weeks from the date of the judgment. The State  had filed  an affidavit  on March  30, 1990, seeking  certain  modifications  or  clarifications  of  the order. One  of the  modifications sought  was that under the Act, the  Deputy Commissioner  is competent authority and an appeal was  provided under  the Act,  except for  Bombay and Pune, the  Additional Commissioner.  For  Pune  and  Bombay, Commissioner would  deal with  the same.  If the  Additional http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 District Judge  was to  supervise  the  functioning  of  the allotment as  per the  scheme sanctioned  under s. 21 of the Act, it  would be inconvenient to the appellant authority to consider the scheme under the Act. The  entire   thinking  of  the  Government  is  wholly misconceived. The  Committee had  nothing  to  do  with  the provisions of  the Urban  Ceiling Act.  After the  exemption under s.20  or 21  is granted,  the building  is required to implement the  scheme in  terms of  the sanction made by the Government for construction of buildings by the builders and allotment to  weaker section  people. This Court intended to ensure that  the builders would abide by the guidelines laid down by  this Court  in  the  light  of  the  judgment.  The Committee would supervise the allotment of the houses to the homeless  weaker   section  people   in  the  light  of  the guidelines laid  down therein. The State Government was also directed to  recirculate the revised schemes in the light of the above  judgment. In  the circumstances,  the question of the Commissioner  sitting in  an appeal  over the working of the Committee does not arise. It  is   submitted  that   the  taking   away  of   the discretionary power  of the  Government in  allotment of the houses is  not justified.  We do  not propose  to modify our earlier direction. The Government is directed to comply with the constitution  of the  Committee within  30 days from the date of  the receipt  of this  order,  since  the  same  has already been  delayed for more than five years from the date of the judgment constituting the committee.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the single Judge of the Bombay High Court made on January 30, 1979 in Second Appeal No.553 of 1971. The admitted  facts are  that the respondent filed suit against the  appellant for  removal of  construction and  to restrain  him  from  interfering  with  his  possession  and enjoyment of land admeasuring 50’ x 30’ marked by letters ""A B C  & D""  in the sketch (Exh.44) claiming title to the said plot. The  trial Court  decreed the  suit, on  appeal it was reversed. In the second appeal, the High Court set aside the decree of  the appellate  Court and  confirmed the decree of the trial Court. Thus this appeal by special leave. It was not disputed during the cross-examination of the witnesses  that   the   property   originally   belongs   to Rukmanibai, the  maternal grand-mother of the respondent who had executed  possessory mortgage  in favour of one Pukharaj and the  said Pukharaj  had given back the mortgage deed and also delivered  possession of  the house  to the respondent. The High  Court, therefore, has taken into consideration all these factual  matrix and  concluded  that  the  respondent- plaintiff has  succeeded to  the estate  of his grand mother and given possession to him by the mortgagee and remained in possession of  the property.  The appellant  had constructed one room  and w.c.  therein for  convenient enjoyment of his property. Though  the appellant had set up his own title, he has not  filed any proof of title except his oral testimony. The appellate Court has concluded that the mortgage does not create any  title  and  proper  evidence  should  have  been produced to  establish title  of the respondents and on that premise set  aside the  judgment and  decree  of  the  trial Court. Sri Joshi, learned counsel for the appellant, contended that the  view of  the appellate Court on the above facts is correct in  law and  the High  Court was  not  justified  to interfere with  the finding  of fact recorded by final Court of  facts.   We  find   no  force  in  the  contention.  The plaintiff/respondent having been found as a successor to the property  from   his  maternal   grand-mother  and   was  in possession  of  the  property  delivered  by  Pukharaj,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 mortgagee,  succession   to  the   estate  of   grand-mother furnished him  the title  to the  property and  delivery  of possession to  him by  the mortgagee  reinforces his  lawful title  to   and  legal   possession  of  the  property.  The respondent is  entitled  to  have  the  possession  retained without any  interference as  sought for  and the injunction granted by the trial Court is correct in law. The High Court rightly allowed the second appeal. The appellant is directed to remove  the  offending  structure  put  up  on  the  said property within  a period  of three  months from  today.  On default, the  respondent will  be  at  liberty  to  have  it removed in  execution of  the decree  and recover  the costs incurred therefor from the appellant. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment of the single Judge of the Bombay High Court made on January 30, 1979 in Second Appeal No.553 of 1971.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of High  Court of  Punjab & Haryana, made on January 17,  1987 in CWP No . 1813/96 . The admitted  position is  that as  per the  policy  of acquisition, the  appellants  are  required  to  provide  an employment to one of the members of the family whose land is acquired. The cut-off date prescribed was December 13, 1991. One Shamsher Singh, brother of the respondent and son of the owner had  applied for appointment.  Since  he was not being considered,  he filed a writ petition before the High Court. The High  court  directed  the  Board-appellant  to  appoint Shamsher Singh.   However,   before  appointment could to be made,   he died.   Consequently,  his wife  Smt. Suresh Bala applied for and was appointed. Subsequently,  the respondent appointment but  he was not given appointment as appointment had already  been given  to the  widow  of  Shamsher  Singh. Consequently, he  filed writ  petition.   The same stand has been taken  in the  High Court;  the Division Bench has held that in  view of the Policy that employment will be provided to  one   of  the  members  of  the  family  of  the  owner, appointment to  the first  respondent us required to be made and appointment  of suresh  Bala is illegal.  Thus appeal by special leave. Shri  Goodwill  Indeevar,    learned  counsel  for  the respondents, contends  that the  land belonged to the mother of the  respondent and  she gave  consent for appointment of Shamsher Singh.   After  his demise, she gave consent to the employment of respondent, her second son. The very object is to provide  assistance to  the displaced  persons due to the acquisition.  As   Shamsher  Singh   died,   the   necessary appointment should  be given  to one  of the  members of the family of  the family  of the owner. Therefore, it is argued that her appointment is illegal in law. However, she being widow had applied for appointment in place of  her husband, Shamsher Singh; admittedly,  sanction was given for giving appointment to her husband, of Shamsher singh. The  appellants have  acceded to her request and gave appointment to Suresh Bala. She having been appointed, there http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 cannot be a direction for appointment of another member from the same  family.   Therefore, the  High is was not right in giving direction to appoint the respondent. The appeal  is according  allowed.  the  writ  petition stands dismissed.

By order dated 29.9.2006, the said writ petitions stood transferred to this Court. Having regard to the arguments advanced before us and in view of the fact that the entitlement of Domestic Users for financial year 2005-06 is going to lapse on 31.3.2007 the following interim order is passed. DGFT would be entitled to grant licences to the applicants who are so entitled under policy circular No. 24 dated 30.8.2005. To that extent our order dated 29.9.2006 stands vacated. In T.P. (C) No. 579/06 filed by the Director General of Foreign Trade it has been inter alia stated that on account of representations received from the traders and the material (including complaints) gathered by DGFT, the impugned new policy came to be enacted. This was after detailed discussions with the Trade. The broad features of the new policy and the reasons for enacting the policy are given in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of T.P. (C) No. 579/06. However, it appears that the requisite material was not supplied to the affected 100% EOUs. who have complained before us that the changes have been made in FTP vide the impugned policy without giving any opportunity to the affected Units. At this stage we may point out that learned Solicitor General of India stated before us that the impugned policy decision  is taken on certain material (including complaints/ representations received) which he is prepared to disclose to the concerned EOUs. Accordingly,  we direct DGFT to supply the material in its possession to the affected EOUs., who have filed the writ petitions, on or before 15.1.2007. The said petitioners (EOUs.) who have filed writ petitions in the High Court shall thereafter make representations to the DGFT within 10 days on and from the receipt of the material (including complaints) from DGFT. Thereafter, DGFT will decide the matter in accordance with law. We make it clear that it will be open to DGFT to equitably work out the matter, if possible. One point, however, needs to be mentioned. It is stated on behalf http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of  M/s Hindustan Granites that they have accumulated wastes which they are entitled to sell in DTA under the unamended policy. It is contended on behalf of M/s Hindustan Granites that they have fulfilled the benchmark of Net Foreign Exchange earnings and, therefore, they were entitled to sell the accumulated wastes in the domestic market (DTA) under para 6.8 (h) on payment of full duty. On this point, M/s Hindustan Granites can also make the representation giving facts and figures regarding the quantity of waste which has accumulated and it will be open to DGFT if possible to decide the question regarding sale of the said waste in the DTA. The question as to whether the impugned circulars/notifications constitutes a change in the policy or whether it is a matter of detail within the existing policy is the question which will be decided on the next date of hearing when we will examine the merits of the case. On receiving the report from DGFT, we shall hear the matter on merits on the next occasion. In the meantime, the ban on EOU Units undertaking DTA sales shall continue to remain in operation.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4152 OF 2002 This appeal is filed by the authority against the order passed by the Division Bench directing creation of additional post to accommodate the respondent No.1. Briefly stated, the facts are as follows. Respondent No.1 was appointed on contingent basis.  The case of the appellant is that the appointment by the Managing Committee of the Duff Primary School at Chinsurah was against non-existing post.  Be that as it may be.  We are not concerned with this.  Suffice it to say, the respondent was stated to have been appointed on contingent paid basis of Rs.50/-.  It appears that repeated request for creation of post has not produced any result and, therefore, the respondent No.1 filed a writ petition before the learned single Judge.  The learned single Judge disposed of the writ petition with a direction to the school authority to pursue the matter for sanction of an additional post on the basis of  increase roll strength. .......2. - 2 - Aggrieved thereby, the authority, the appellant herein, filed an appeal MAT No.3956/1999.  The Division Bench disposed of the appeal by impugned order in terms of the following:- ""We, therefore, direct that the creation of the additional post shall be made and completed in all respects within three months hereof positively and the writ petitioner’s appointment in the said post shall be completed within six months hereof, within which time the writ petitioner shall commence drawing her regular monthly and other emoluments."" Aggrieved thereby, the authority has preferred this appeal by special leave. The short question on the basis of which we would allow this appeal is that the creation of a post is within the domain of the executive authority.  It is not the function of the Courts to create posts. There is catena of decision of this Court on this point. Avoiding multiplicity, a recent judgment of this Court was delivered in Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club & Anr. Vs. Chander Hass & Anr., 2007 (14) Scale 1.  This Court clearly pointed out in paragraph 15 of its judgment that the Court cannot direct the creation of posts.  Creation and sanction of posts is a prerogative of the executive or legislative   authorities  and  the  Court  cannot arrogate to ......3. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 - 3 - itself this purely executive or legislative function, and direct creation of posts in any organization.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition  arises from  the judgment and order  of the  Bombay High  Court, Nagpur Bench, made on March 8, 1996 in W.P.No. 3161 of 1983. The admitted position is  that   notification  under  Section  4(1)  of  the  Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894) (for short, the ’Act’) was published in  the Gazette and thereafter it was published in the locality  on September  15, 1992.  The  land  originally belonged  to   Sudam  Z.  More,  the  father-in-law  of  the petitioner. It  would appear that at a family settlement due to incompatibility  of the  petitioner in  living  with  her husband, mutual divorce was effected in consideration of her walking out  from the marital home. After divorce, 2 acres 5 gunthas of land in Survey No. 16 of Jambhakhurd was given to the petitioner.  Under Rule 1 of Rules made under the Act by Maharashtra Government,  notice was  given to the father-in- law  of   the  petitioner,  namely,  S.More.  He  filed  his objections, Admittedly,  the divorce  deed was  executed  on June  2,   1992  and  on  her  own  admission  she  made  an application to  the Patwari for  mutation on June 6, 1992 on the date  of the  issuance of the notification under Section 4(1) and  on the  date of  issue  of  notice  under  Rule  1 mutation was  not effected  and her  name was not brought on record as  an owner  of the  land. On  the other  hand,  the holder of the land was admitted her father-in-law and notice was given to him. The question arises whether the failure to give notice  vitiates the enquiry conducted under Section 5A of the  Act and  by operation  of sub-section (2) of Section 5A, the proceedings of enquiry are vitiated. It is true that sub-section (2)  of Section  5A as amended by Act 68 of 1984 envisages that  notice on the owner or persons interested on any authorised  person on  his behalf  shall be  given and a right of  hearing also  shall be  given, on objections being filed.  On   such  objections,  after  making  such  further enquiry,  if   any,  as   he  thinks   necessary,  the  Land Acquisition Officer  shall report  in respect  of  the  land http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 whether notified  under Section 4 or any different parcel of the  land   was  needed   for  the  public  purpose  to  the appropriate Government containing his recommendations on the objections together  with the record of the proceedings held by him  for decision  of the  Government. In this case since holder on  record has already been given notice and he filed his objections  after enquiry  he was heard, the omission to give notice  to the petitioner who subsequently became owner of the property does not vitiate the enquiry conducted under Section 5A  nor is  the enquiry violative of sub-section (2) of Section  5A. The  High Court,  therefore, was   right  in refusing to  interface with  the declaration published under Section 6 and notification published under Section 4. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","The land  originally belonged to   Sudam  Z. More,  the  father-in-law  of the petitioner.

In the appeal, the order of assessment passed by the present appellants was under challenge.  The order of the respondents related to refusal to entertain the complaint of the respondents and confirmation of rateable value. 3.

In other words it is submitted the judgment is practically non-reasoned. 4.      Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand said that though elaborate analysis have not been made, yet the conclusions have been arrived at after noting the submissions. 5.      It is to be noted that various contentious pleas were raised in the appeal.   The High Court ought to have analysed the factual position in the background of principles of law involved and then to decide the appeal. That has not been done. 6.      It is to be noted that after making detailed reference to the arguments and contentions raised, abrupt conclusions were arrived at by the High Court.

The order of appointment, which is Annexure R-V to  the petition  is the  proceedings dated  October 15, 1976  of  the  Director  of  Public  Instruction  (Education Department), Haryana. It would show that consequent upon the decision of  the Government  of Haryana to absorb the N.D.S. Instructors in  the State Service with effect from 1.7.1976, they were  appointed as  PTI (NFC) D.P.E. on temporary basis in the  pay scale of Rs.125-5-150-250/- and Rs.220-6-300/10- 400/- respectively.

The Tribunal accepted  this  stand  and rejected the claim against the insurer.

Apart from the judgment under appeal, we find that  this view is supported by two judgments of the Madras High  Court and  an earlier decision of the Punjab & Haryana High  Court Two Division Benches of the Madras High Court have taken the view  after  discussing the law at length  that  the  policy taken during any part of the day becomes operative from  the commencement of that day. Besides these judgments a Division Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court in Jaddoo Singh & Anr.  v. Smt. Malti Devi & Anr., AIR 1983 All.  87  supports this view on principle. There  is  evidence in this case that  the  vehicle  was insured  earlier upto 31.8. 1984 and the same was  available to  be  renewed but instead of obtaining  renewal,  a  fresh insurance  was taken from 28th of September, 1984, which  is the date of the accident. We are inclined to agree with  the view  indicated  in these decisions that when  a  policy  is taken  on  a particular date its effectiveness is  from  the commencement of the date and, therefore, the High Court,  in our  opinion,  was  right in holding that  the  insurer  was liable  in  terms of the Act to meet the  inability  of  the owner under the award. As  pointed out in Stroud’s judicial  Dictionary  ’Date’ means day, so that where a cover not providing for temporary insurance of a motor 572 car expires 15 days after date of commencement, it runs  for the full 15 days after the day on which it was to commence."" Similarly  it has been stated in Stroud that ""a bill  of exchange, or note, is of the date expressed on its face, not the time when it is actually issued."" ’To the same effect is the decision in Re F & B  Warren, [1938]  Ch. 725 where it has been held that a  judicial  act will be referred to the first moment of the day on which  it is  done. A payment made by a bankrupt in the morning  of  a day is, therefore, not made, within section 45 of the  Bank- ruptcy  Act, 1914 before the date of a receiving order  made later in the same day. The ratio of these also supports the view we have taken. The appeals fails and are dismissed. There would, howev- er, be no order for costs. N.P.V.                                         Appeals  dis- missed. 573","The insurer repudiated its liability by maintaining that the policy had been taken after the accident.

In appeal, the High Court took the view relying upon certain decisions that the insurance policy obtained on the date of the accident became operative.",civil,24.39
" CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 432 of 1981. From the  Judgment and  order dated the 25th September, 1980 of  the High  Court of  Andhra Pradesh  at Hyderabad in Criminal Revision Case No. 461 of 1980. P. Ram Reddy and G.N. Rao for the Petitioner. The order of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY.  J. The respondent was charged with an offence under  Section 34  (a) of  the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act on  the allegation  that he was found in possession of a quantity of  eight litres  of illicitly distilled arrack, an intoxicant, in  contravention of  the provisions  of the Act and the Rules made under the Act. The learned Judicial First Class Magistrate convicted him and sentenced . him to suffer rigorous imprisonment  for a  period of two years, which was the minimum  sentence that  could be  awarded for an offence under Section  34 (a)  of the  A.P. Excise Act. On an appeal preferred by  the respondent,  the Sessions Judge, Anantapur con firmed  the  conviction  and  sentence.  The  respondent preferred a  revision petition  before the  High Court.  The learned Single  Judge who  heard the  revision confirmed the conviction. But, on the question of sentence, he observed: 497 ""Mr. T.  Ramulu, appearing  for the petitioner who has A  filed this  revision through jail, has submitted that the  petitioner is  aged 30  years and  is a first offender and  he has already served a sentence of about http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 IN months  and that  the sentence  may be appropriately modified. It  is true that under the A.P. Excise Act, a statutory minimum  sentence is  prescribed. But  having regard to  the  submissions  made  above,  I  feel  the interest of  justice will  be satisfied if the sentence of  imprisonment  imposed  against  the  petitioner  is reduced to the period already undergone and if the fine of Rs.  5O/-, imposed  is set  aside. The  revision  is dismissed subject to the modification as stated above."" We are  unable to understand why the High Court reduced the sentence.  The statute prescribes a minimum sentence. It does not  provide for  any exceptions  and does not vest the Court with  any discretion  to award  a sentence  below  the prescribed minimum  under  any  special  circumstances.  The learned judge  has himself noticed that the sentence imposed is the  statutory minimum.  Having noticed  that the statute prescribes a  minimum sentence  for the  offence,  the  High Court has ununderstably reduced the sentence of imprisonment to less  than the  minimum permissible.  The High  Court was clearly in  error in  doing so. We think we have said enough to correct the error. It is unnecessary to pursue the matter further by granting special leave. The petition is dismissed with the above observations. P.B.R.                                   Petition dismissed. 498","Petitioner was found in possession of a quantity of eight litres of illicitly distilled arrack, an intoxicant, in contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules made under the Act.

The above appeal is directed against the order dt.10.01.2006 passed by the High Court of Delhi in CM(M) No.1720 of 2004.  The said Civil Miscellaneous Appeal was filed before the Delhi High Court against the order of Addl.District Judge, Delhi in H.M.A.Case No. 149 of 2003 whereby the said court had disposed of the application filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and fixed an interim maintenance at the rate of 12,000/- per month from the date of filing of the application together with litigation expenses of Rs.11,000/-. Aggrieved against the said order, CM(M) No.1720/2004 has been filed before the Delhi High Court.  The High Court on considering all the averments made in the pleadings and also taking into consideration all the other annexures etc. came to the conclusion that the trial court has rightly arrived at a conclusion that Rs.12,000/- should be paid by way of interim maintenance. We have also carefully perused the impugned order and  annexures and heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both sides.  In our opinion, the order under challenge suffers from no infirmity.  We, therefore, have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant-husband. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO.621 OF 2008 (arising out of SLP(C)No.14469/2005) Leave granted. Heard the parties. This appeal filed by the Management is directed against the judgment dated 04.04.2005 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur in Writ Petition No.145 of 2005 dismissing the petition filed by the appellants and confirming the order dated 22.09.2004 passed by the School Tribunal, Nagpur. By the said order the School Tribunal set aside the order of termination of the respondent-employee and directed his reinstatement on the full back wages. Briefly stated the facts are as follows : The respondent No.1 herein was appointed as Assistant Teacher on probation by an order dated 29.12.1993, vide order dated 10.02.1995 passed by the Education Officer the appointment was approved till the end ..2/- : 2 : of academic session.  It appears that the communication was received from the Education Officer(Secondary) that two Sections, namely, VIIth and Ixth classes of the School have been reduced for the session 1995-96. Pursuant to the aforesaid communication the service of the respondent-employee was rendered surplus in view of reduction of standard VIIth for the session 1995-96 by an order dated 15.12.1995. Aggrieved thereby, the respondent filed an appeal before the School Tribunal.  The School Tribunal by the impugned order while setting aside the order of termination, directed the management reinstatement with full back wages. As already noted writ petition before the High Court without any reason has been dismissed.  Hence this appeal by special leave. This Court on 01.08.2005 issued notice limited to the question of grant of full back wages. It is not disputed that the respondent did not render any service to the Institute from 15.12.1995 till reinstatement on 03.05.2005. On applying the principle of no work no pay the respondent shall not be entitled for the period when he has not rendered any service to the Institute. At the same time, we also have to take note that the order of termination dated 15.12.1995 stands quashed by an order of Tribunal on 22.09.2004, therefore, in our view, the  ends  of  justice  would  be  secured if we direct the : 3 : appellant-management to pay the back wages to the respondent-employee with effect http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 from 22.09.2004 the date on which the Tribunal rendered its judgment setting aside the order of termination.  According to us, this view is equitable and would serve the ends of justice.  Accordingly, the order of the School Tribunal and the High Court with regard to the payment of back wages are modified to the extent that the respondent would get back wages with effect from 22.09.2004 till his reinstatement. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms. The appellant shall pay the back wages to the respondent within two months from today.","This appeal filed by the Management is directed against the judgment dated 04.04.2005 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the Punjab  & Haryana High Court, made on October 4, 1995 in Writ Petition No. 9718 of 1994. Action was take under Punjab Police Rules  for taking  disciplinary  action  against  the respondent for  his failure   to  report for  duty    during period from   November  21, 1991  to October  31,  1992.  An inquiry was  conducted against  the respondent  and  it  was conducted against  the respondent  and it was found that his absence was wilful. The High Court has set aside his removal from service  on the  ground that  subsistence allowance was not paid  to him and, therefore, his absence was not wilful. Rule 16.21 reads as under; ""16.21 -  Status and  treatment  of officer under  suspension -  (1)  A police officer  shall not by reason being suspended  from office  cease to be a police officer. During  the   term   of   such suspension  the  powers,  functions and privileges  vested in  him as a police   officer    shall   be   in abeyance,  but  he  shall  continue subject      to       the      same responsiblities, discipline  and to the same  authorities, as if he had not been suspended."" A reading of it would clearly indicate that even during the period  of suspension  the police officer is required to attend to roll call and be available to the authorities. The payment of  subsistence allowance,  as  ordered,  under  the suspension rule  is one  facet of  it and  his  duty  to  be present is another. No-payment of subsistence allowance does not entitle  a delinquent officer to be absent from duty. It is his duty to claim subsistence allowances and if it is not paid, necessary  representation to  the  higher  authorities and, if  the grievance  is not redressed, to the appropriate forum seeking  payment, may  be made. But that does not mean http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that the  delinquent officer,  in the  face of  the  express rule,  can   absent   himself   from   duty.   Under   these circumstances, the  conclusion reached  by the  disciplinary authority that  he was  wilfully absent  from duty  is  well justified. However, on the quantum of punishment imposed, on the facts  and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that instead  of the  removal, compulsorily  retirement from service would be an appropriate punishment. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the High Court  stands  set  aside.  Instead  of  the  order  of removal, the authorities are directed to consider passing an order compulsorily retiring him from service so that he will be eligible  to the  pensionary benefits  and other benefits under the rules, No costs.","The High Court has set aside his removal from service on the ground that  subsistence allowance was not paid to him and, therefore, his absence was not wilful.

" O R D E R The short  question that  arises for  decision in  this appeal is  whether the  application filed  under order  VIII Rule 6  A of  the Code  of civil procedure on 22.6.85 by the defendant respondents  in Civil  Case No.  248/82 pending in the Court  of learned Munsiff at Serampore was barred by the provision of  order VIII  Rule  6A  of  the  Code  of  Civil procedure. By the impugned order, it has been held that such application was  not barred  under Order VIII Rule 6A of the Code of  Civil  procedure  even  after  filing  the  written statement, such an application can be presented provided the cause of  action for  filing the  counter claim  had  arisen before or  after the  institution of  the said suit and such cause of action had continued till the filing of the written statement. It  was sought  to be  contended by the appellant that once  the written  statement is filed. such application for counter  claim under  Order VIII  Rule 6A  is  ex  facie barred. In our  view, the  impugned decision  does not  warrant interference. Such  question was  specifically raised before this Court  in Mahendra  Kumar and  Ors vs.  state of Madhya Pradesh and  Ors. (1987  (3) SCC  265). It  has been held by this Court  that right  to file  a counter claim under Order VIII Rule  6A of the code of Civil Procedure is referable to the date  of accrual of the cause of action. if the cause of action had  arisen before  or after  the filing of the suit, and such  cause of  action continued upto the date of filing written  statement   or  extended  date  of  filing  written statement, such counter claim can be filed even after filing the written  statement. The  said Civil  Case No. 248/82, in which the  application under  Order VIII  Rule 6A  has  been filed by the defendant respondents was has been filed by the defendant respondents  was instituted  on  15.7.82  and  the application under  Order  VIII  Rule  6A  was  presented  on 22.685. It  cannot be  held that the cause of action for the suit or  counter claim  was ex  facie barred  by  limitation under Limitation  act. It was been sought to be contended by the learned  councel for  the appellant  that in the instant case, the  cause  of  action  had  arisen  long  before  the institution  of   the  said   civil  case  No.  248/82  and, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 therefore, the  suit and counter claim were barred under the Limitation Act.  Such question  was not  raised  before  the Court below  and, therefore,  had not  been gone into. It is therefore, not  necessary for  this Court to decide the same because the  question of  limitation regarding  the suit  if raised will  be  decided  after  ascertaining  the  date  of accrual of  the cause  of action  on the  basis of  relevant materials to  be placed  on record.  We are  therefore,  not expressing any  opinion on  the said contention sought to be raised by  the learned  counsel for  the appellant,  for the first time before this Court. As the application under order VIII Rule  6A is  not ex  facie barred  the  impugned  order cannot be  held to  be incorrect on the grounds urged before the court  below .  We therefore find no reason to interfere with the  impugned order.  This appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed without any order as to costs. It appears  that C.S.  No. 178/80 and Civil Case 248/82 have been  directed to be heard analogously before the Court of the learned Munsiff. Since both the suits are pending for a long time, it is only desirable that both the suits should be disposed  of as  early as practicable preferably within a period of  six months  from the date of communication of the order. We  reasonably expect  that the  Trial Court would be alive  to   the  urgency   of  the  disposal  of  the  suits expeditiously and  will take  all necessary.

" O R D E R This Civil  Appeal Calls  in question  an order  of the Bombay High  Court in  Writ Petition No. 427 of 1993 decided on 24th August, 1993. The impugned order reads thus:- ""Rejected. We do  not wish  to  exercise  writ jurisdiction  in   view  of  return filed by Land Acquisition Officer."" Mr. Dhruv  Mehta, learned  counsel for  the appellants, submits that  in the  writ petition  filed in the High Court specific allegations  had been  made  that  the  acquisition proceedings were  vitiated on  account of bar of limitation. That it  was averred that the declaration under Section 6 of the Land  Acquisition Act  had been made after the expiry of one year  from the  date of  publication of the Notification under section  4 which  vitiated the  declaration as well as the acquisition.  According  to  the  learned  counsel,  the appellants in  the writ petition had also raised a plea that there was  an unexplained and unreasonable gap of almost one year between  the date  of the  first  publication  of  that Notification in the official gazette later on and keeping in view the  fact that emergency provisions under Section 17 of the Land  Acquisition Act  had been  invoked, that gap would defeat the  very intention of the Amendment made in 1984. It was pointed  out that  in the counter-affidavit filed by the respondents in the High Court no specific reply was given to these averments  in the writ petition but the Division Bench of the  High Court  did not  examine that aspect of the case and  therefore   judgement  of  the  High  Court  cannot  be sustained. We find force in the submission of the learned counsel. The High  Court simply  dismissed the Writ petition ""In view of return  filed by  land acquisition Officer"". We have been unable to  appreciate as  to what circumstances weighed with the High  Court to  dismiss the  writ  petition  in  limine. Since, in  the return filed by the Land Acquisition Officer, factual averments  were not  controverted, their  effect was required to be considered by the High Court. No reasons have been given and this Court has been deprived from testing the reasons which  might have  weighed with the High Court while http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 rejecting the  writ petition  in liminie. Obligation to give reasons introduces  clarity and  excludes  or  at  any  rate minimises the  chances  of  arbitrariness.  Since,  arguable points had  been raised  in the  writ  petition,  the  Bench should have  given some reasons, howsoever brief, in support of its  order. To  say the  least it  was an  unsatisfactory manner of disposal of the writ petition. We, therefore, find that the  impugned order cannot be sustained and accept this appeal. We  set aside  the impugned  order of the High Court dated 24th  August, 1993  and remand  the case  to the  High court for  its fresh  disposal in  accordance with  law. We, request the  Hon’ble the  Chief Justice of the High Court to have the  petition placed  before a  Division Bench  for  an early disposal. This Court  had granted  an  order  of  status  quo  as regards possession only on 14th February, 1994. That interim direction shall  continue to  remain in  operation till  the writ petition is disposed of.

" THE 27TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1997 Present: Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.T. Nanavati Hon’bel Mr. Justice V.N. Khare R.S. Sodhi, Kuldip Singh, Advs. for the appellant Sudhir  Walia,   Adv.  for   Prem  Malhotra,  Adv.  for  the Respondent J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: Nanvati, J. The State is challenging acquittal of the respondent in this appeal. The respondent  was tried  for the  murder of Kulwinder Singh and  the trial  court relying  upon  the  evidence  of Kulwinder Kaur- PW 5 and Gian Singh - PW 4 which proved that the accused  and the  deceased were last seen together and t he evidence of recovery of currency notes and wrist watch of the deceased,  on the  basis of  a declaration  made by  the accused, held  him quality.  The appellant was convicted for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. The High  Court held that Gian Singh was chance witness and therefore it was risky to rely upon his evidence without any corroboration.  The High Court also held that identiy of currency notes  and the  wrist watch  was not established by the proesecution  beyond doubt  and  therefore  it  was  not possible to say that they belonged to the deceased. The High Court, therefore, acquitted the respondent. After going  through the  evidence what we find is that the recovery  of money  and the  wrist watch stated to be of the deceased  were recovered by the Investigating officer in presence of  Amar Singh  - PW 10 - Maternal grandfather of t he deceased.  Thus, the  recovery was not in presence of any independent person.  It was  for this  reason that  the High Court did  not think  it safe  to place  any reliance on the recovery evidence.  The evidence  of PW  5 -  Kulwinder Kaur even if  believed only  establishes that the accused and the deceased left  together at  5.00 p.m.  on 18.2.85. From that circumstance alone  no  inference  can  be  drawn  that  the respondent had committed the murder of Kulwinder Singh. We therefore  see no  good reason to interfere with the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 acquittal order  passed by  the High  Court. The  appeal is, therefore, dismissed.",High Court held that Gian Singh was chance witness and therefore it was risky to rely upon his evidence without any corroboration.

" JUDGMENT O R D E R [Arising out of SLP (C) No.128/2007] 1.      Heard counsel for the appellant.  No one appears for the respondent despite notice. 2.      Leave granted. 3.      This appeal is directed against the orders passed by the City Civil Court and the High Court denying the appellant- defendant the leave to defend the suit filed by the respondent under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\021CPC\022 for short). 4.      The respondent-defendant instituted the suit on the basis of a promissory note, dated November 11, 2004, for Rs.1,50,000/- along with interest at the rate of 25% per annum allegedly signed by the appellant in the presence of two witnesses. 5.      On notice by the court, the appellant filed a petition under Rule 3, Order 37 of CPC seeking leave to defend the suit without any condition.  On behalf of the appellant, it was stated that the promissory note, forming the basis of the defendant\022s claim was completely sham and fabricated. It was further stated that he was an uneducated and illiterate person, engaged in the work of civil construction, as a contractor.  He lived in the same locality and had agreed to build the house of the appellant\022s son. He completed the construction of the house  at a relatively much cheaper rate of Rs.430/- per square ft.  The defendant- respondent/her son used to take his signatures on blank stamp papers telling him that those were for receipts of the payments made to him and were required for income tax purposes.  Being a simple, uneducated person he put his signatures on blank papers without any question and in good faith.  It was alleged that one of the signatures made by him   was later used to forge the promissory note for filing the suit. 6.        It was also stated on his behalf that the alleged signatures on the promissory note were not his signatures as would be apparent from the fact that there were two signatures on the promissory note, one in English and the other in Telugu. 7.      The trial court noted that the contentions raised by the appellant for defending the suit were quite inconsistent.  On the one hand, he denied the signatures on the promissory note as his signatures and, on the other hand, it was stated that his signatures were obtained on blank stamp papers on the pretext that those were to be made into receipts for payments made to him and one of those signatures was used for creating the promissory note.  The trial court accordingly rejected the petition filed by the appellant under Order 37, Rule 3, CPC. 8.     Against the order passed by the trial court, the appellant http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 moved the High Court in revision but the High Court dismissed the revision and affirmed the order passed by the trial court primarily on the ground that there was an inherent inconsistency in the case of the appellant. 9.    On hearing the counsel for the appellant and on going through the materials on record, we feel that the trial court and High Court have taken a rather technical view of the matter. On a careful consideration of the matter, we are satisfied, that in the overall facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner ought to have at least been allowed to defend the suit, subject to the condition of depositing a part of the plaintiff\022s claim.  We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the trial court and the High Court and direct that the petitioner may be granted leave to defend the suit subject to deposit of Rs.50,000/- in the trial court.  The leave shall be granted to the appellant provided the amount, as directed above, is deposited within two months from today.",The appeal is directed against the orders passed by the City Civil Court and the High Court denying the appellant- defendant the leave to defend the suit.

On  reference, the  Additional District  Judge by  his award  and   decree  dated   March  19,  1982  enhanced  the compensation to Rs.25,000/- per acre and R5.20,000/-per acre on the  basis of  belting. The  learned single  Judge by his judgment and  decree dated December 2, 1988 further enhanced the compensation  to Rs.43,000/- and Rs.34,000/- per acre on belting basis,  but applied  the provisions of Amendment Act 68 of  1984. In  this appeal, we are concerned only with the applicability of  Sections 23 (2), 28 and 23(1-A) of the Act as amended  by Act  68 of  1984. Since  the reference  Court determined the  compensation on  March 19, 1982, i.e., prior to the  introduction of the Amendment Act, the claimants are not entitled  to the enhanced solatium and interest and also the additional  amount under  section 23(2),  28 and 23(1-A) respectively of the Act. It is  brought to our notice that dissatisfied with the enhanced compensation  of Rs.43,000/- per acre, the claimant has filed  Letters Patent  Appeal and that it is pending. If that is  so, we  need  not  go  into  the  question  whether determination of  the compensation  by  the  learned  single Judge at  Rs.43,000/- per  acre is  justified  or  not.  The matter is  left open.  The Division  Bench would  be free to decide the  matter according  to law.  But  as  regards  the applicability of  the amended  provisions, in  view  of  the above facts,  the learned  single Judge was clearly in error in extending  the  additional  benefits  under  the  amended provisions of the Act. The  appeal is accordingly allowed.

Instead,  the claimant is entitled to 15% solatium under  section 23 (2) and 6% interest under Section 28 as  unamended,  on enhanced compensation from the date of taking   possession till  date of  deposit  into  Court.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  dated May  7, 1991  of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at  Chandigarh made  in RSA No.2260/80. The admitted facts are  that three  appellants along  with 27  others had gone in  a procession, in spite of the prohibitory order, to represent, to the Superintendent of Police at his residence, their  grievance   of  inadequate  accommodation  and  other facilities not  provided to  them. That was done after their duty was  over in  the  evening.  For  the  making  of  such representation and  for violating  the prohibitory order, an enquiry was  conducted against  the three appellants who had taken initiative  and led  the procession,  making a  charge that they  were guilty of grave misconduct under Rule 16 [2] of the  Punjab Police  Rules which  is  held  to  have  been proved; resultantly,  they were  dismissed from service. The order of  dismissal was confirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the appellants filed  suit for  declaration that  the  order  of dismissal was  null and  void and  inoperative; the suit was decreed on  April 7,  1979. On  appeal, it  was dismissed on February 20,  1980. In  the second  appeal, the  High  Court reversed the  decisions and  dismissed the  suit. Thus  this appeal by special leave. It is  true that the appellants are disciplined members of  the   police  force.   The   grievance   of   inadequate accommodation provided  to them is a legitimate grievance to be represented  to the  officer for its redressal. No doubt, prohibitory order was issued and there is violation thereof; however, the  appellants marched  peacefully to  make  their representation. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that  they  have  committed  misconduct  warranting  extreme penalty of dismissal from service. Accordingly, the order of the High  Court is  set aside.  However, the respondents are directed to  impose penalty  of stoppage  of  one  increment without cumulative effect. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The appeal  is accordingly  allowed.

" J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1.      Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant questioning correctness of the award dated 25.8.2003 made by the Presiding Officer Central Government Industrial Tribunal cum Labour Court, Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as the ’Labour Court’). 2.      Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: 3.      Respondent was engaged as Mazadoor on daily wages basis during various periods from 1.1.1985 to 15.1.1987.  He was engaged as per the requirement of the department on the basis of specific sanction of muster roll vacancies from time to time.  However, the aforesaid sanction did not exceed 25 days in one stretch of period under any circumstances and the period of Sundays and holidays were also included in the above period. As the services of the respondent no.1 were no longer required, his engagement was terminated on 16.1.1987.  After about five years respondent no.1 sought for a reference and claimed that his services were to be regularized.  He claimed that he has worked for more than 240 days and, therefore, the termination of service without following the procedures of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short ’the Act’) was bad in law.  The appellant filed reply to the claim petition.  It was specifically pleaded that the appellant is a part of the Defence Department and is not an industry and, therefore, the reference was not maintainable.  Labour Court did not specifically deal with this aspect and holding that the respondent had rendered services for 240 days, his termination was not sustainable.  The award was challenged before the High Court. Apart from the other controversies a specific plea was raised that the appellant is not an industry and, therefore, the Act has no application. 4.      The High Court by the impugned order held that the requirements of Section 25F of the Act had not been complied with and, therefore, the order of the Labour Court was not to be interfered with. 5.      Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the basic plea that the Act has no application and the appellant cannot be treated as an industry, has not been considered. 6.      Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the order of the High Court does not suffer from any http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 infirmity. 7.      From a perusal of the orders of the Labour Court and the High Court, it is noticed that the factual position has not been analysed in detail and abrupt conclusion has been arrived at. Additionally, the legal issue regarding maintainability of the reference was not considered. Right from the beginning of the proceedings before the Labour Court and in the High Court, appellant had taken specific plea that the Act was not applicable to it and it was not an industry.  Unfortunately, as noted above, neither the Labour Court nor the High Court dealt with this issue. 8.      Above being the position, we set aside the orders of the Labour Court and the High Court and remit the matter to the Labour Court to decide the objection raised by the appellant about the maintainability of the proceedings under the Act, founded on the claim that it is not an industry.  The other factual aspects shall also be considered on evidence being led by the parties. 9.

" O R D E R This special  leave petition has been filed against the order of  the High Court of Delhi, made on 13.3.1997 in C.W. No. 1085/97. The predecessor  of the petitioner-Company had taken on rent  the   disputed  premises,   fro  the   Life  Insurance Corporation,  on   4th  floor   of  Jeevan   Deep  Building, Parliament Street,  New Delhi.  Since the petitioner had not vacated the  premises, action  was taken  eviction under the Public Premises  (Eviction of  Unauthorised Occupants)  Act. The petitioner  challenged the  action  in  the  High  Court contending that  this Court  has issued  directions in  I.A.

The petitioner has sought for such a reference and  contends the High-power Committee should have been constituted and decided the matter. We find no force in the contention. The object of issuing direction in those matters was to decide the fiscal disputes in case of major policy matter to save the  public money and court valuable time, and disputes could  amicably   be  settled   between  the  Public  Sector Undertaking  and  the  Government  of  India  or  the  State Government. The  intention was  not to  resolve the disputes like eviction  of a  company  or  public  Undertaking  under Public Premises  (Unauthorised Occupants)  Act;  such  petty disputes are not directed to be dealt with by the High level officers whose  otherwise duty and time is of very important nature.

" O R D E R THE 5TH DAY OF MAY, 1997 Present, Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice D.P.Wadhwa A.S. Sohal, Adv. for R.S. Sodhi, Adv. for the  appellants. O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: Though all  steps have been taken to ensure the service of  notice,  the  respondent  could  not  be  contacted  for service.   Even the  last know  address was tapped to effect the service; but  that has also proved abortive. Under these circumstances, notice must be deemed to have been served. Leave granted. The respondent,   who  was a  Constable in  the  police service of  the state of Punjab,  absented himself from duty for a  long period,  i.e., from November 7, 1986 to March 1, 1988, without  any leave.   As a result, disciplinary action was conducted.   The  disciplinary authority on the basis of finding of dereliction  of non-reporting for duty, dismissed him from  service. The  ci trial  court dismissed  the  suit filed by  the respondent.   On  appeal, the  first appellate Court   remanded the   matter  for   reconsideration  by the trial court on the point of punishment.  The  High Court has dismissed the  Second Appeal  No. 155/96  summarily  by  its judgment and  order dated  August  21,  1996.    Thus,  this appeal by special leave. The  appellate court recorded the finding as under: ""I have  gone   through the   above authorities   and    am   of    the considered opinion   that  although the  plaintiff     was   admittedly guilty of  misconduct in  absenting himself but misconduct could not be classified as  the gravest  act  of misconduct within  the  meaning  of the  sub-rule.     The   contention appears to  be well-founded.  It is true that,  generally speaking,  it is for  the punishing  authority to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 determine   the    seriousness   of punishment and it is not within the ambit of  the powers  of this Court to interfere with the direction  of the authority.  But then there rule and that  is that  the  court  will strike down  an order    which  has been     passed  illegal  only  and arbitrarily. In  the present  case, it was  incumbent on the punishment of dismissal,  to come to a finding that the  misconduct attributed  to the respondent  was a  ’gravest act of misconduct’.   It  is  true that in  the   context  in   which  that expression is used it does not mean an act  of misconduct  and means,on the other  hand, an  act denoting a very high  degree of  misconduct as opposed to a merely grave or a very grave act  of misconduct.  But then it appears that the defendants when awarding   the punishment  were not alive to the provisions of the sub- rule otherwise  he would  not  only not have  awarded the punishment of dismissal  without   coming  to   a finding   that    the    misconduct attributed to the respondent was of the Gravest  type but  would at all for the reasons that the misconduct even though  grave was  not of  the Gravest type.   The lack of finding about the  misconduct being of thre requisite tupe  makes the  impugned order  arbitrary   in  nature  and, therefore, liable to be quashed."" It is  settled  legal  position  that  it  is  for  the disciplinary authority  to pass appropriate punishment;  the civil Court  cannot substitutte  its own view to that of the disciplinary as  well as  appellate  authority on the nature of the  punishment  to  be  imposed  upon  the    delinquent officer.   In view  of the   finding  of the appellant Court that it is a grave misconduct, the appellate Court ought not to have  interfered with the decree of the trial Court.

However, on their  passing  trade  test  for  carpenter  and wireman  they  were appointed as wiremen-cum-carpenters with effect from   16.12.1968.        As    the    category    of carpenter-cum-wireman   was  a  non-standard  category,  the North-Eastern railway  authority  decided  to  abolish  this category in  1978.    Options were invited from the original appellants who were six in number  to  opt  either  for  the carpenter’s category  or  wireman’s  category.   In 1979 the appellants  exercised  their  option  for  the  category  of wireman.  Thereafter  they were posted as wiremen.  However, on account of problems which arose relating to the seniority of the appellants qua  the  existing  wiremen,  the  General Manager  of  North-Eastern  railway  by  issuing order dated 24.9.1984, decided to put the appellants in the category  of carpenter   which  was  the  category  in  which  they  were initially appointed.  Their  names  were  removed  from  the seniority list of wiremen. The appellants had, in the meanwhile, in 1984  filed a  suit  for a declaration that they were eligible to appear for the test for promotion to  the  highly  skilled  wireman Grade II posts.    Since they were absorbed as wiremen.  The suit was decreed.  The appeal which was transferred  to  the Central  Administrative  Tribunal  has  been allowed and the suit has been dismissed.  The Tribunal has rightly  come  to the  conclusion  that  under  paragraph  2011  of the Indian Railway Establishment Code Volume II a  competent  authority may  transfer  a  railway  servant  from one post to another provided  that,  except  on  account  of   inefficiency   or misbehaviour  or  on  his  written  request, he shall not be transferred to a post carrying less pay than the pay of  the post over which he holds a lien. In the present  case  the  posts  of  carpenter  and wireman  are  equivalent posts carrying the same pay and the same terms and conditions of service.  The post of carpenter is also a post  to  which  the  appellants  were  originally appointed.   Now,  on  account of administrative reasons the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellants have been posted as carpenter instead of  wiremen when  the  category of carpenter-cum-wireman was proposed to be abolished.  We are also informed  that  out  of  the  six appellants  two  have been died and the other four have been working  as  carpenter  after  the   Tribunal’s   order   of 10.2.1987.   Looking to all the circumstances of the present case this is not a fit case for setting aside  the  decision of  the  General  Manager  of  24.9.1984 when the appellants continued to get the same pay in the same pay-scale and  the terms  and  conditions  of  service were not affected in any manner. The appeal  is  therefore,  dismissed.  There  will, however, be no orders as to costs.","The appellants were initially appointed in the service of the North Eastern Railway as carpenters.

The relevant section with the proviso is as follows:- S. 10(1) ""The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head ""Profits and gains of business, profession  or vocation"" in respect of the  profits or  gains  of  any  business, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 profession or vocation carried on by him.

The petitioner  is a limited company with its registered office  at  Madurai  in  the  State  of Madras 596 which owns  a  fleet  of  buses  and  lorries  and carries on the business of transport In respect of assessment year  1960-61 it  claimed a development rebate on  all its  plants and machinery including business. The  Income tax  Officer disallowed  the claim of  rebate on  transport vehicles  under the proviso above  quoted and computed the tax payable without such rebate. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the proviso offends Art. 14 in that it  discriminates between  machinery which is office appliance  or road  transport vehicles  and other kind of machinery. It is difficult to accept such a  contention because there is nothing in the Constitution which  prevents the  legislature from choosing  the  object  of  taxation  from  amongst various classes  of machinery  for the  purpose of giving development  rebate. The  Constitution does not prohibit  any such  classification  which  has been made in the pressnt case. The petition  is wholly  without merit and is therefore dismissed  and the  rule is  discharged. The  petitioner   will  pay   the  costs   of  the respondent.

" O R D E R Three accused,  including the  appellant  Shera  Singh, were tried  for an  offence of  murder  before  the  learned Sessions Judge,  Feorzepur in  Sessions Trial No.41 of 1983. By the  Judgment dated  29th July, 1983 the learned Sessions Judge convicted all the three accused under Section 302 read with 34  of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced each of them to suffer  imprisonment for  life  and  to  pay  a  fine  of Rs.500/- or  in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.  The said three convicted accused, including the appellant, preferred  appeal before  the Punjab  and Haryana High Court  being Criminal Appeal No. 560-DB of 1983. By the impugned Judgment  dated 17th  July, 1984,  the  High  Court acquitted the two co-accused Lachman Singh and Balbir Singh, but the conviction of the appellant for an offence of murder under Section  302 IPC has been upheld by the High Court. It may be  stated that in this case there is no direct evidence about the complicity of any of the accused in committing the murder of  one Sucha  Singh at about 9.00 P.M. on 28th July. 1982 excepting the evidence of the approver. being PW.13. As per  illustration  (b)  under  Section  114  of  the  Indian Evidence Act,  1872, an  accomplice is  unworthy of  credit, unless he  is corroborated  in material  particulars. In the instant case, the only evidence other than the deposition of the said  approver, is  the deposition of PW.16. the brother of the  deceased who  only stated that the deceased was seen by the  said brother  near the canal bridge of village Midna at about 9.00 P.M. on 28th July, 1982 and he had gone to the western side  alongwith the  appellant Shera  Singh. As  the names of  other two accused were not mentioned by PW.16, the High Court gave them the benefit of doubt and acquitted them but since  the name  of the appellant was mentioned by PW 16 as the person with whom the deceased was last seen together, the conviction  against the appellant has been upheld by the High Court.  The High Court has held that as the name of the appellant was mentioned by PW 16 as the person with whom the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 deceased  was   last  seen,  the  evidence  of  PW  16  gets corroboration from the deposition of the approver PW 13. In our  view, such  finding of  the High  Court is  not justified. Simply on the basis of evidence of PW 16 that the deceased was  last seen in the company of the appellant, the appellant is  not liable  to be convicted for the offence of murder. The  deposition of  an approver  is required  to  be corroborated in material particulars. The circumstance about which PW  16 deposed  cannot be regarded such a corporation. So, the  conviction of  the appellant  by relying  upon  the evidence of  PW 13  was not  justified. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence passed against the  appellant. The  appellant has  been released on bail during  the pendency  of this appeal by this Court.

The deceased being an employee not covered by the Workmen’s Compensation Act, of the insured, the owner of the vehicle, has not been covered compulsorily under the Act and only by entering into of a special contract by the insured with the insurer should such a person be brought under coverage.

Chandro.  In the year  1943 the  mother  of  the appellant  died.   Respondent  No.1 married Smt. Satan Kaur (Respondent No.2) in  the year  1946, On  April 12, 1948  the  grandfather  of  the appellant  purchased  the  disputed house in the name of the appellant. However, on May 19, 1949 the grand- father of  the appellant  sold  the said   disputed    house   for    a consideration  of   Rs.2,000/-   in favour of  the step-mother  of  the appellant i.e. Respondent No.2. The suit in  question was filed on July 2, 1974  on behalf of the appellant for      permanent       injunction restraining  the  Respondent  Nos.1 and 2  from  interfering  with  the possession of  the appellant.  That suit was  dismissed  by  the  Civil Judge. The  appeal filed  on behalf o.   the    appellant   was    also dismissed.  The   High  Court  also dismissed the  second appeal  filed on  behalf  of  the  appellant.  It appears to  be an admitted position that the  appellant has remained in possession of the house throughout. However, learned  counsel appearing http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for the  appellant  made  an  offer that the  appellant was prepared to give half  portion of  the house to Respondent   No.2   and   is   also prepared to  deliver possession  of that  portion   in  order  to  have peaceful  settlement.   Mr.  Sodhi, learned counsel  appearing for  the respondents stated  that the matter be listed on some other day when he will  inform   in  respect  of  the attitude of the respondents. If the settlement is  arrived at,  memo of settlement should  be filed on that date."" Mr.  Sodhi,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the respondents on  August 20,  1996 informed  that he could not receive any  instructions from the respondents in respect of the offer made on behalf of the appellant on August 8, 1996. But he  suggested that  the Court  may pass  any appropriate order  taking   all  the   facts  and   circumstances   into consideration  as  well  as  the  interest  of  the  parties concerned. According  to us, the offer made on behalf of the appellant shall  be in  the interest of both the parties. In view of an admitted position that the respondent No.2 is not in possession of the house in question and for one reason or the other  the appellant  has continued in possession of the aid house  throughout,  it  would  be  in  the  interest  of Respondent No.2  also that  she is  given possession  of the half portion  of the  house as  offered  on  behalf  of  the appellant.

The facts  are that the respondent was engaged on daily wages on  muster roll  basis in Central Scheme and were paid out of  the funds  provided by the Central Government. It is stated that  after the scheme was closed their services were dispensed with. When the respondents filed the writ petition in the  High Court,  the High  Court gave  interim direction dated 6th  January, 1993  and directed them to be re-engaged elsewhere.  Pursuant  to  the  interim  direction  the  writ petition came  to be disposed of on March 9, 1993. Thus this appeal by special leave.

The judgment of the Court was  delivered by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.--This appeal from a judgment of  the High  Court  of Judicature at Allahabad.dated  31st  August, 1944, raises the same points as have been discussed in Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1940 (1).  The Income-tax Appellate  Tribu- nal referred four questions to the High Court of  Judicature at Allahabad under section 66 ( 1 ) of the Indian Income.tax Act.  These  questions  related to the  year  of  assessment 1930-40.   The High Court answered two of the  questions  in the affirmative and two in the negative.  The two  questions relating  to the appeal are those that were answered in  the affirmative and are as follows :-- ""Whether (1) the amount of house-tax and (2) the  amount of  water-tax, imposed by the Municipal Board  of  Allahabad under  section  128, sub-section (1) clauses  (i)  and  (x), respectively  of  the United provinces  Municipalities  Act, 1916, and paid by the owner as a lessor under section 149 of that  Act should be deducted as an allowance from  the  bona fide  annual  value of the property  determined  under  sub- section  (1) read with sub-section (2) of section 9  of  the Act,  on  the ground that such amount is an  annual  charge, which  is  not  a capital charge to which  the  property  is subject within the meaning of clause (iv) of sub-section (1) of section 9 of the Act."" (1)  New  piecegoods  Bazar  Co.  Ltd.  v.  Commissioner  of Income-tax, Bombay [1950] S.C.R. 553. 565 Under section 128 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act, 1916, the municipality can impose a tax in the whole or any  part of the municipality on the annual value of  build- ings or land or of both, and a water-tax on the annual value of  buildings  or land or of both.  Every such  tax  on  the annual value of buildings or land or both is leviable on the actual  occupier of the property upon which the  said  taxes are  assessed, if he is the owner of the buildings or  lands or holds them on a building or other lease from the Crown or from the Board, or on a building lease from any person.   In any  other case the tax is leviable from the lessor, if  the property is let (vide section 149).  Section 177 enacts that all sums due on account of a tax imposed on the annual value of  buildings or lands or both shall, subject to  the  prior payment  of  the land revenue, i.f any, due to  His  Majesty thereupon, be a first charge upon such buildings or lands. It  is  apparent therefore that the  provisions  of  the United Provinces Act in respect of the levy of the taxes are substantially  similar to the provisions of the  Bombay  Act discussed  in Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1949 (1). For the  rea- sons  given in that appeal and as a result of that  decision this appeal stands dismissed with costs and we consider that the High Court of Allahabad has answered the questions above mentioned correctly.

" O R D E R Leave granted. The appellants  laid the  suit for specific performance of the  agreement of  reconveyance dated  30th August, 1967. Application  under  Order  16  Rule  17  of  Code  of  Civil Procedure, 1908 was filed seeking amendment of the plaint by incorporating  averments   in  para   3  thereof.  Thus  the appellants pleaded  that the  transactions of  execution  of sale deed  and obtaining  a document  for reconveyance  were single transactions.  viz., mortgage by conditional sale. In paragraph 9,  they wanted  alternative relief  to redeem the mortgage. At  the end  of the  prayer, the  plaintiff sought alternatively to  grant a decree for redemption of mortgage. This  application  was  rejected  by  the  Trail  Court.  On revision, the  High Court  of Andhra  Pradesh confirmed  the same holding  that in  the original  plaint the suit was for specific  performance   and   the   reconveyance   was   not incorporated in  the sale  deed  and  that,  therefore,  the amendment was  not warranted.  Amendment  would  change  the nature of the suit as well as cause of action. We  called  upon  the  appellant  to  produce  original agreement  of   reconveyance.  We  have  seen  the  original document which  contains the  recitals  in  support  of  the contention raised  by the appellants. It is settled law that the plaintiff  is entitled to plead even inconsistent pleas. In this  case, they  are seeking  alternative  reliefs.  The application was  for amendment of the plaint whereby neither cause of  action  could  change  nor  the  relief  could  be materially affected. We allow the same. The appellants  shall file  amended plaint. It would be open to  the respondents to raise all the defences by filing additional written statement.

" with CRl.A.NO.624/91 J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. Both these  appeals are  filed against the judgment and order passed  by the Rajasthan High Court in DB (Crl) Appeal No.12/89. Criminal  Appeal No.623/91 is filed by the brother of the  deceased and  Criminal Appeal  No.624/91 is filed by the State. Respondents -  Ranveer, Bhadar  Ram, Chet Ram, Het Ram, Mohan Singh and Om Prakash were convicted by the trial court for the  murder of Duni Ram. The conviction was based mainly upon the  evidence of  the eye-witness  - PW 1- Mohar Singh, brother of  the deceased.  The other evidence relied upon by the prosecution was of corroborative nature. The trial court also relied  upon the  dying declaration stated to have been made by the deceased before his wife - PW 7 - Gomti. The High Court on reappreciation of evidence found that the evidence  of PW  1  was  not  reliable  as  regards  the identity of the accused. The High Court has pointed out that PW 1  immediately on  his return  to the  village, after the incident and  sister-in-law that  Duni  Ram  was  beaten  by ‘Bhanbhus’. It  may be  stated that ‘Bhanbhu’ is a sub-caste of Jats.  As PW  1 had not given names of the assailants but described them  as ‘Bhanbhus’,  the High  Court held that in all probabilities  PW 1 had not identified the assailants of Duni Ram.  Another  reason  given  by  the  High  Court  for doubting the  version of PW 1 is that the incident had taken place at  about 8.30  p.m. It  was a dark night. The reasons given by  the High Court appear to be correct. PW 1 has also admitted that  he could  see the  assailants only  when they were at  a distance  of  about  10  paces.  Admittedly,  the assault took  place about  30 to 40 paces away from where he was standing and therefore he stated that he could not state whether any  of the  blows given  to Duni  Ram had caused an injury. That  would indicate  that it was quite dark at that time  and   the  witness  was  not  able  to  recognise  the assailants and  therefore after  reaching  the  village,  he merely described  the assailants  at  ‘Bhanbbus’.  The  High court has  also pointed out that no reliance could be placed on the  FIR which  contains  the  names  of  the  assailants http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 because PW  1 in his cross-examination has admitted that the FIR was  taken down after the Inspector visited the site and they were then taken to the police station. As regards  the dying  declaration stated  to have been made by  the deceased  to his  wife,  it  appears  that  the deceased could  not have  made such  a dying  declaration in view of the number of injuries received by him. The evidence of Gomti  - PW  7 is  that when  she reached  the  place  of incident, her  husband - Duni Ram was in a position to speak and when  she enquired, he gave the names of the assailants. However, she  admitted that immediately after saying so, her husband had  became unconscious. No other witness has spoken about this  dying declaration.  The High Court was therefore right in not placing reliance upon the dying declaration. As there  was no  other evidence,  the High  Court  was right in  acquitting the  accused. The  order  of  acquittal passed by the High Court does not call for any interference. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.","Ranveer, Bhadar  Ram, Chet Ram, Het Ram, Mohan Singh and Om Prakash were convicted by the trial court for the murder of Duni Ram.

" O R D E R The SLP  is filed  against the  order  of  the  Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, Circuit at Shimla made on  17.11.1995 in  O.A. No.758/HP/91.  The  petitioner, admittedly, after  completing his  33  years  of  qualifying service submitted,  on February 18, 1991, an application for voluntary retirement  under Section  48A  of  Pension  Rules which came  to be  accepted on  May 2,  1991 w.e.f. June 30, 1991 as  requested by  him. After the receipt of this letter and acceptance  on the even date, namely, May 2, 1991 and of another letter dated May 23, 1991, he sought to withdraw his application for  voluntary retirement which he had submitted but was  not accepted  by the  authorities.  Thereafter,  he filed O.A. in the Tribunal contending that he is entitled to withdraw his  application before  the relationship of master and  servant   becomes  operative,   i.e.,  July   1,  1991. Acceptance  of  his  resignation  before  that  date,  i.e., 30.6.1991 is  not valid  in law.  Under  Rule  48-A  of  the Pension  Rules,  a  Government  servant,  on  completion  of required period  of service,  is entitled  to make a request for  voluntary  retirement.  Admittedly,  that  request  was acceded to and resignation was accepted. Learned counsel for the petitioner  sought to  rely upon  the judgment  of  this Court in  Balram Gupta  vs. Union of India [(1987) Supp. SCC 228] in  which this  Court held  that a  Government  servant after making application but before it becomes effective and relationship of  master and  the servant  ceases operate, is entitled to  withdraw the  resignation. that  case,  on  the facts and circumstances, it was held that he was pressurized in the  first instance  to voluntary  retire. With a view to get it  over he  had submitted his application for voluntary retirement. Subsequently,  he reconciled. The entitlement to withdraw  the   application  for  voluntary  retirement  was accepted by  this Court.  It is  seen  that  in  this  case, admittedly, the  petitioner has  stated that he was on leave for  one  year  prior  to  the  date  of  seeking  voluntary http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 retirement on medical grounds and he was unable to discharge the duties and that, therefore, he had sought to voluntarily retire from  service. It  would  appear  that  when  he  was transferred from  Shimla to  Faridabad, he had submitted his application in  a huff  for voluntary  retirement  and  that thereafter  he   came  forward   with  the  application  for withdrawal. It  is true  that the petitioner was entitled to withdraw the  resignation. But  in view  of the fact that he has  already   attained   the   superannuation   in   normal circumstances on  February 28,  1994, no useful purpose will be served  by giving direction to permit him to withdraw his application. Under these circumstances, the petition is dismissed.","The SLP is filed against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, Circuit at Shimla made on 17.11.1995 in O.A.

" O R D E R Leave granted. These appeals  by special leave arise from the order of the Division  Bench of  the High  Court of  Gauhati made  on August 2,  1994 in W.A. Nos.30 and 31 of 1993. This Court on February 9,  1996 noticed  the contention raised by Shri Rao that the  Principals in  the private  colleges taken over by the Government,  were not  required to put in minimum length of service  as lecturer,  while the  lecturer in  Government college, to  become Principal  is required  to put  in three years’ service, as initial period, to become lecturer and 10 years’ service  thereafter as a lecturer. The  Government in G.O. No.9  dated 11.4.1994, while exercising the power under Article 309 of the Constitution issued the orders w.e.f. the date of  the application  indicating that  the past  service rendered by  the employees  of the  Government  colleges  in Government aided/private educational institutions which were subsequently taken over by the State Government on or before December 20,  1979 shall be counted as experience of service required for  promotion or  direct recruitment,  as the case may be, provided that there were no interruption in between. based thereon  it was contended that since the Principal who worked in  the private  colleges were  appointed directly or promoted as principals without insisting upon the minimum 10 years’  service   they  would  always  steal  a  march  over Government  lecturers   to  become  Principal  and  also  as Directors in  the higher  leader of  services and  that  the discrimination would always loom large as against Government lecturers/Principals since  the Principals  of  the  private colleges would remain to be seniors to the principals in the Government colleges. Since the learned counsel appearing for the State  did not have instructions, she had sought for and was granted time. The Government have now explained in their orders that they are insisting upon the private lecturers 10 years’ service  as Principal  for promotion  as Director and that,  therefore,  the  seniority  is  being  counted  after http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 computing minimum  10 years’  service as lecturer/principal, as the  case may  be, to  the post  of Directors.  If, as  a consequence of  such computation,  they become  seniors, the inevitable would follow and no discrimination can be imputed on that  account. It  is also  made clear  by the Government that they  are maintaining  two separate  seniority  of  the Government teachers and of the teachers/Principals worked in the taken-over  colleges, as  another list. It is made clear that the  above order would be applicable only in respect of the teachers  of the taken-over colleges as indicated in the rule itself. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.

" THE 3RD DAY OF FEBRUARY, 1997 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.T. Nanavati A.K. Goel and Mrs. Sheela Goel, Advs. for the Petitioner O R D E R The following Order of the Court was delivered: This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the Himachal  Pradesh High Court, made on September 18, 1996 in Second  Appeal  No.215  of  1987.  Admittedly,  both  the petitioner  and   the  respondents  had  filed  civil  suits claiming damages  against each  other. The petitioner’s suit was dismissed  and the  respondents’ suit was also dismissed by the  trial Court  but on appeal filed by the respondents, it was  allowed and was decreed for recovery of Rs.24,875/-. The petitioner  filed second appeal against the decree which was admitted.  However, the  petitioner did  not  carry  the matter in second appeal against his suit for damages and was content with  filing an appeal against the decree of damages granted against  him. The  High Court recording the findings has held thus: ""Thus,  on   the   basis   of   the aforesaid factual  as well as legal proposition, it  can safely be said that where two connected suits have been   tried   together   and   the findings recorded in one of he suit have become  final in absence of an appeal,   the    appeal   preferred against the  findings  recorded  in the other  suit would definitely be barred by  the  principles  of  res judicata. This  is the ratio of the above cited case law decided by the apex Court  of the  country.  Thus, there is absolutely no necessity to go  into   other  aspects   of  the appeal, especially  when on factual side,  as   detailed   above,   the decree, not appealed against by the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 present appellant,  passed  by  the first appellate  Court, has  become final between  the  parties,  which has created  a legal  bar  for  the maintainability  of   the   present appeal whereby the decree passed in the other suit has been assailed."" It would  be obvious  that  since  the  claims  of  the petitioner and  the respondents  have arisen  from the  same cause of  action and the finding of the appellate Court that damages had  accurred to  the respondents due to misfeasance or malfeasance  having been  allowed to  become  final,  the decree which is subject matter of the special leave petition cannot be  assailed. The  self same question was directly in issue and was the subject matter of both the suits. The same having been  allowed to become final, it cannot be gone into since the  same had attained finality, the petitioner having not filed any appeal against the appeal dismissing the suit. In view  of this  situation, the  High Court  was  right  in concluding that  the decree of dismissal of the suit against the petitioner  would operate  as res judicata under Section 11 CPC  in the appeal against which the petitioner has filed the second appeal. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","Both the petitioner and the respondents had filed civil suits claiming damages against each other.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench of the Madras High Court made in Writ Appeal No. 32/77 on April 26, 1982. Respondent M.  Sambandan  and  others  had  filed  writ petition  in   the  High   Court   seeking   direction   for consideration their  case for  promotion  in  terms  of  the executive instructions  issued by  the  Board.  The  learned single Judge dismissed the petition. On appeal, the Division Bench upon  instructions issued  by the  Board and held that the promotion  should be in terms of the instructions issued by the  Board which  terms of the instructions issued by the Board which  bind the  zonal promotions.  Those instructions came to  be issued in exercise of Regulation 91 of the Staff Regulations. The  question, therefore,  is whether  the view taken by the Division Bench is correct in law? Regulation 10 of the Staff Regulations, 1971 reads under: ""All promotions shall be considered by   a    Promotion   Board    duly constituted for  purpose and  shall be   regulated   by   the   general instructions to  be issued  by  the Corporation from  time to  time  in regard to  the field  of choice  of candidates, the  size of  the panel and validity of the panel."" The Regulation provides that such of the candidates who have put  in three  years experience as Assistant Category I are eligible  to be  considered for  promotion as  Assistant Managers in  Category II  post.  It  is  now  settled  legal position that  executive instructions  cannot be  issued  in derogation  of   the  statutory   Regulations  require  that experience  of   three   years   is   a   pre-condition   to consideration  for   promotion  to  Category  II  post  from Category I post, it would be obvious that any relaxation was in defeasance  of the above Regulations. The Division Bench, therefore, was not right in upholding the power of the Board in directing  relaxation of  the statutory  Regulations  and consideration of the cases without considering the claims of all the  eligible persons.  Moreover, later the Board itself http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 cancelled 1970 panel. Regulation issued for promotion of the Scheduled  Castes   and  Scheduled  Tribes  should  also  be considered. Admittedly,  they were not considered. Since the claims of  all the  persons are  not before  us, we  do  not propose to close the matter at this end. Accordingly, we set aside the  order  of  the  Division  Bench  and  direct  the concerned authorities to determine the promotions of all the eligible  persons   in   accordance   with   the   statutory Regulations and  pass appropriate  orders within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of the order.

" D.P.Mohapatra,J. Leave granted. Shri Harjinder Singh learned counsel for the appellant has not challenged  before us the conviction of the appellant under Section 135 of the Customs Act, 1962 and the sentence of simple imprisonment  for five years and fine of Rs.5,000/-.  The sole contention raised by him is that the mother of the appellant who is an old lady is seriously ill in Poland and she has expressed a desire to see her only son. He referred to a copy of the letter dated 15.5.2001 received from the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in Mumbai to the Minister of Jails (Gujarat)  requesting him to grant remission of the remaining period of sentence (then 7 months) on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. Learned counsel further contended that the appellant has already undergone substantial part of the sentence which is to be completed in December, 2001.  In view of the subsequent development after the judgment of the High Court the learned counsel contended that this Court may reduce the sentence to the period of imprisonment already undergone and order release of the appellant immediately. Sri T.V.Ratnam, learned counsel for the respondents contended that in view of the serious allegations made against the appellant in the case this Court should not accept the prayer for modification of the sentence. From the discussions in the judgment of the High Court it appears that a plea for reduction of the sentence was made on behalf of the appellant before the Court. The High Court referring to the judgment of this Court in the case of Devchand Kalyan Tandel Vs. State of Gujarat reported in 1997 (89) E.L.T. 433 (S.C.) and the case of K.I.Pavunnv vs. Assistant Collector (H.Q.) Central Excise, Collectorate, Cochin, reported in 1997 (90) E.L.T. 241 (S.C.) declined to take a lenient view in the matter and rejected the plea for reduction of the period of the sentence. In K.T. Pavunny vs. Assistant Collector case (supra) http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 this Court altered the sentence.  The operative portion of the judgment reads as follows: ""Having reached the finding that the appellant has committed the offences under section 135(1)(i) of the Act and Sections 85(1)(a) and 86 of the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 we think that instead of being committed to jail, the appellant should be sentenced to pay fine of Rs.10,000 and Rs.5,000 respectively for the two aforementioned offences, within 4 months from today. In default, he shall undergo imprisonment for a period of 2 months and 1 month respectively which are directed to run consecutively. The appeal  is accordingly allowed to the above extent of modification and the sentences imposed by the High Court stand modified accordingly."" We have considered the prayer  of the appellant for reduction of sentence to the period already undergone.

" O R D E R The appellant  appears to  have come into possession of 30 bighas,  13 biswas  of land.  Subsequently,  the  evacuee property vested in the Government of India was taken over by the  State   Government  for   distribution  to  the  people according to  the procedure  prescribed by the Government of Punjab. It  would appear  that in  1962,  applications  were invited for  allotment of the land as per that procedure and the appellant  had not  applied for  allotment. In 1967, the land came to be sold to the people at an auction. Respondent No.5 -  Fateh Singh  - appears  to have  become the  highest bidder for  a sum  of  Rs.3,800/-  and  the  sale  was  duly confirmed. Subsequently,  time was extened to the persons to make applications  and the  last date was February 22, 1968. Thereunder the  appellant came  to make an application dated January 5,  1968 for  confirmation of  sale of  land in  his favour by a sale. The competent officer sold the laid to the appellant and conveyed it by registered sale deed dated June 26, 1968.  That sale  came to  be cancelled  by order  dated February 5, 1974 passed by the second respondent on the ground that  the land was already sold to the 5th respondent on February  27, 1967 and hence the same could not be resold to the  appellant under  the aforesaid sale deed. Therefore, it  is   not  valid  order.  Calling  that  cancellation  in question, the  appellant came  to file  the writ petition in the High  Court. In Writ Petition No.4953 the Division Bench by order dated October 4, 1979 dismissed the petition. Thus, this appeal. The learned  counsel for  the appellant  contended that though the  respondent was  the highest  bidder, he  had not deposited the  full consideration  of the  bid amount; there was no  sale certificate  issued to  him and thereby the 5th respondent could not become the owner of the property to the extent of  13 bighas 13 biswas which was sold in the auction to him. The Division Bench was not right in holding that the appellant was not entitled to the sale on the ground that it http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was already  put to auction in favour of the 5th respondent. When  we   pointedly  asked  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant for  the order  of confirmation  of sale  of  land dated February  27, 1967,  in fairness,  the learned counsel has stated  that the  said order  was not  made part  of the record. The  confirmation  of  the  sale  conferred  certain rights on  the 5th  respondent. Unless the sale was duly set aside, the sale property held and concluded could not be put to resale  and sold  to the appellant on June 26, 1968. As a consequence, the  cancellation of  the sale  by order  dated February 5,  1974 cannot be said to be vitiated by any error of law warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","The evacuee property vested in the Government of India was taken over by the State   Government for distribution. In 1967, the land came to be sold to the people at an auction.

" J U D G M E N T ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. The High Court of Patna dismissed the Civil Revision filed by the appellant summarily. Challenge in the Civil Revision was to the order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, VII, Patna, in execution proceedings. By the said order Subordinate Judge held that the plea raised by the appellant about the execution petition being barred by time in terms of Article 136 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (in short the ’Limitation Act’) was untenable. Learned Subordinate Judge held that the period of limitation starts running not from the date of decree, but when the decree becomes enforceable i.e. when it is signed. In support of the appeal strong reliance was placed on several decisions of this Court i.e. W.B. Essential Commodities Supply Corpn. v. Swadesh Agro Farming & Storage Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. (1999 (8) SCC 315), Hameed Joharan (Dead) and Ors. v. Abdul Salam (Dead) by Lrs. And Ors. (2001 (7) SCC 573). In Hameed Joharan’s case (supra) it was held after referring to the meaning to the word ’enforce’ from various dictionaries words ’when the decree or order becomes enforceable’ should be read in literal sense and as per intention of the legislators 12 years period is to be reckoned from the date the decree became enforceable i.e. the date of the decree or order. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the correct position of law is expressed in Shankar Balant Lokhande (Dead) by LRs. v. Chandrakant S. Lokhande & Anr. (1995 (3) SCC 413) and in other two cases the correct principles in law were not kept in view. We find that there is some area of conflict amongst several two-judge Bench decisions. It is also to be noticed that noticing the conflict between these judgments, reference has been made to a three-Judge Bench in Chiranji Lal (dead) by Lrs. Hari Das (dead) by Lrs. (2005 (2) SCC 261). This case may also be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders to be placed alongwith Chiranji Lal’s case (supra).","High Court of Patna dismissed the Civil Revision filed by the appellant summarily.

This appeal has been filed against the judgment of the Himachal Pradesh High Court dated 5.1.2005 in Writ Petition No.143 of 2004. Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the record.  The short question in this case is whether the Freedom Fighters’ Pension should be granted to the respondent from the date of the application or the date of the order granting the pension. It has been held by this Court in Government of India vs. K.V. Swaminathan (1997) 10 SCC 190 that where the claim is allowed on the basis of benefit of doubt, the pension should be granted not from the date of the application but from the date of the order. In the present case, we have perused the record and found that it is stated therein that the claim was allowed on the basis of secondary nature of evidence.  In other words, the claim was not allowed on the basis of jail certificate produced by the claimant but on the basis of oral statement of some other detenue  Hence, we are of the opinion that the pension should be granted from the date of the order and not from the date of the application. Learned counsel for respondent has relied on the judgment of this Court in Mukand Lal Bhandari Vs. Union of India & Ors. AIR 1993 SC 2127. In our opinion that decision is distinguishable as it has been stated therein that the pension cannot be granted from any date prior to the application.  In our opinion this does not mean that it cannot be granted from a date subsequent to the application. For the reasons given above this appeal is allowed.

All  the  three  accused filed Criminal  Appeal  No.396  of  1980  in  the  High  Court  of Judicature at  Allahabad.    The  High  Court  held that the accused had acted in exercise of  ""their  right  of  private defence  but  had  exceeded  the  same and, therefore, their conviction under Section 302 was not proper.  It, therefore, partly allowed the appeal by setting aside their  conviction under  Section 304, IPC and by convicting them under Section 304, Part I, IPC, and sentenced them to suffer 7 years’ R.l. Out of the three convicted, accused only the  appellant  has filed an appeal challenging his and conviction under Section 304, Part I, IPC, and also the order of sentence. What  is  urged  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant  is  that  the  conviction  of the appellant under Section 304, Part I, IPC, is not sustainable as there is  no evidence  to  show  that  he  had  inflicted any blow on the deceased.  He submitted that the evidence which was  led  by the  prosecution  was of general nature as Munshi Lal - PW-1 and Raja Ram- PW -2 - have not specifically stated that  the appellant  had  given  any  particular  blow with a stick to deceased Ram Saran. In  this  case,  the  accused  had  also led defence evidence to prove that accused Ramanand  had  also  received injuries during  the  same incident.  After appreciating the evidence of the prosecution witnesses  and  considering  the circumstance  that  the  accused  had also received injuries which had remained unexplained the High Court  came  to  the conclusion  that  the  prosecution  version  was not such as could be accepted in toto.  It also took note  of  the  fact that  independent  witnesses,  though  available,  were  not examined by the prosecution.  It also held that the  accused had a  right  of  private  defence.   It held that the three convicted accused had exceeded the right of private  defence http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 but  we  do not find any evidence to show that the appellant had given, fatal blow or any blow which was likely to  cause the death of  Ram.   Saran.  In absence of such evidence the appellant could have been convicted only under  Section  325 and not under Section 304 Part I IPC.  We, therefore, partly allow  this appeal and alter the conviction of the appellant from that under Section 304, Part I, IPC to Section 325 IPC. Consequently, the order of sentence is also modified and the sentence of 7 years’ R.I.  imposed upon him is reduced to RI for 2 years.","The appellant, and the other two co-accused, were convicted by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge Shahjahanpur, in Sessions Trial No .181 of 1979 for the offence punishable under Section  302  I.P.C.

The award was made on 3/2/1996 by three arbitrators.  The award was filed before the learned single Judge for making it the rule of the court.  The appellant filed objections under Section 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940(hereinafter ’the Act’, for short) taking various grounds.

An adventurist challenge to the factum of marriage between the  two, by  the petitioner  in this  special leave petition, has  been negatived  by the  High Court.  A strong presumption arises  in favour of wed-lock where the partners have lived  together for  a long  spell as husband and wife. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Although the  presumption is rebuttable, a heavy burden lies on him  who seeks  to  deprive  the  relationship  of  legal origin. Law  leans in  favour of  legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy. In this view, the contention of Shri Garg, for the petitioner, that  long after  the alleged marriage, evidence has not  been produced  to sustain its ceremonial process by examining  the   priest  or  other  witnesses,  deserves  no consideration. If man and woman who live as husband and wife in society  are compelled to prove, half a century later, by eye-witness evidence  that they  were validly  married,  few will succeed.

In this appeal by special leave, the State of Uttar Pradesh has impugned the common judgment and order of the High Court of  Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow in Criminal Appeal Nos.590, 598 and 601 of 1979.   The respondents, herein were  the appellants in the appeals before the High Court, who had challenged the judgment and order of the VII Addl. Sessions Judge, Hardoi dated 20th July, 1979 convicting the appellants variously under Sections 302/149, 148 IPC, 324/149 IPC.   They were sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 302/149 IPC and 2 years rigorous imprisonment both under Sections 148 and 324/149 IPC. The appeals  preferred  by the respondents were allowed by the High Court by its judgment and order dated 31st July, 1995. These appeals arise out of an occurrence which took place on  29.1.1978 at 9.00 A.M. in village Amrita, just outside the house of PW-1 the informant.   In the occurrence, the respondents herein and some others are said to have attacked the deceased Hira  Singh, armed with fire arms and lathis, as a result of which the aforesaid Hira Singh succumbed to his injuries.    The prosecution relied upon the testimony of the 4 witnesses as eye witnesses, namely, PWS.1,2,8&9.   The High Court has found these witnesses to be unreliable for the reasons recorded by it. We have gone through the judgment of the High Court and we find that it has considered the evidence of the witnesses and pointed out the infirmities in their evidence which dis-credited their testimony.   We find that the appreciation of the evidence by the High Court is neither perverse nor are the findings recorded  not supported by evidence on record.  Moreover, the conclusion reached by the High Court is a possible reasonable conclusion which could be arrived at on the basis of the evidence on record. We, therefore, find that this is not a case in which this Court may be justified in interfering with the order of acquittal. In the result, we find no merit in these appeals and the same are accordingly dismissed.

When the matter came before the Land Tribunal, it was submitted by the predecessor of the appellants that in fact he had moved an application for occupancy right with regard to Khasra No.139/6-D.

The learned Single Judge by his order dated 13.3.2002 allowed the said writ petition and set aside the order of the Land Tribunal.  The learned Single Judge proceeded on the basis that there was no application for correction of the mistake in respect of survey number in the application and therefore the Land Tribunal had no jurisdiction to grant occupancy rights in respect of a survey number other than the one prayed for.  The High Court held that the application moved by the predecessor of the appellants on 24.12.1974 was not amended and the occupancy right claimed by the appellant remained for Survey No.147/1A and not for 139/6D and thus the Land Tribunal committed an error in giving the occupancy right over the land which was not the subject matter of an application moved by the predecessor of the appellants. 4.      The Division Bench has confirmed the order of the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench has held that there was no application for amendment and there was no order allowing any such application and therefore the order of the learned Single Judge was correct. 5.      The learned counsel for the appellants could not show us any application moved for amendment of the form claiming occupancy right wherein Survey No.147/1A was substituted by Survey No.139/6D.  The Land Tribunal was not right in giving the occupancy right in respect of the land which was not the subject matter of an application moved by the predecessor of the appellants.  The Land Tribunal had no authority to give occupancy right of a land which was not applied for.  If the Land Tribunal confers occupancy rights for a land which was not mentioned in the form, the owner of that land who has a right to oppose the conferral of the occupancy right in that land has no such opportunity. 6.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) NO. 3675 OF 2006) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court. The High Court by the impugned order partly accepted the challenge made by the respondent no.1, the informant, in Crime no.53 of 2005. Factual background in a nutshell is as follows: On the basis of the information given by respondent no.2 case of alleged commission of offence punishable under Section 498-A, 323, 504 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’) read with Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (in short ’Dowry Act’) was registered. After investigation charge sheet was filed against the appellants. The magistrate took cognizance of the offences and issued summons to the accused persons. The offences are triable by Magistrate, First Class. The informant filed an application before the concerned Magistrate to the effect that on the basis of evidence collected by the investigating officer, cognizance ought to have been taken for offence punishable under Sections 406 and 307 IPC. The magistrate was of the view that after evidence is adduced, commission of the  offence punishable under Sections 406 and 307 IPC is made out, then the prayer of the informant could be considered. Respondent no.2 filed a petition before the High Court stating that the materials collected by the investigating officer and contained in the case diary itself justified trial under Sections 307 and 406 IPC.  It was pointed out that by addition of these sections, the case should be tried by the Court of Sessions while on the basis of cognizance taken the case is triable by the Magistrate. The High Court was of the view that the Magistrate had not applied his mind to the merits of the points raised by the informant.  The Magistrate was not bound by the description in the police report and while taking cognizance it could make variation if there was sufficient material before him.  The High Court felt that when the informant claimed that the materials contained in the case diary indicated commission of certain offences which make it case triable exclusively by the Court of Sessions, the Magistrate should at the time of framing charges consider and decide points so that unnecessary proceedings http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 are not taken up if the case is to ultimately go before the Sessions Judge. After having so held the High Court held that proper stage is the stage of framing charge.  Direction was given to consider and decide the matter afresh. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. It rightly held that at the time of framing charge the Magistrate could consider as to what are the offences for which accused persons have to be tried.  Having held so, the High Court could not have found fault with the Magistrate’s observations to similar effect. We find that the High Court has unnecessary made certain observations which lead to contrary conclusions. Having held that the proper stage for consideration is stage of framing charge, there was no necessity for further observations and/or directions.  It rightly held that the Magistrate is not bound to take cognizance of the offences indicated in the police report.  That being so, the ultimate directions of the High Court materially differ from its earlier conclusions. The Magistrate has to consider material at the time of framing charge.  Needless to say he will pass necessary orders if according to him the case is triable by the Court of Sessions. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.","The High Court partly accepted the challenge made by the informant, in Crime no.53 of 2005.

We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and after examining the statement made in the application for condonation of delay, we are of the view that the statements made in the said application for condonation of delay of 63 days do constitute sufficient cause for condoning the delay in filing the appeal. 4.      Accordingly, the application for condonation of delay is allowed and the appeal is restored to its original number. 5.      Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and we request the High Court to decide the appeal on merits and in accordance with law within a period of three months from this date.

" CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 4160 of 1985 From the Judgment and Order dated 25. 6. 1984 of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Kerala High Court in T. R. C. No. 19 of 1984. 1075 V. J. Francis for the Appellant. A R.M. Ansari ,Markose Vellpally and D. N. Misra, for the Respondent, The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI,  J.   The   sole   question   which   arises   for determination in  this appeal  is as  to what is the rate at which the  goods which  had been purchased earlier and which were in  stock with  the assessee on 30-6-74 were assessable to purchase  tax when  the purchases  were found  to be last purchases as  a result of events which took place subsequent to 30. 6. 1974 This question has become C material since the rate of purchase tax was increased from 3% to 5% with effect from 1st  July, 1974.  Now it is not disputed in the present case that  the purchases  of goods  effected by the assessee prior to  30-6-74  were  last  purchases  within  the  State because the  goods purchased  which were in stock on 30-6-74 were subsequently  sold by  the assessee  in the  course  of inter-state trade or commerce Which means that they were not sold within the State and hence the assessee was clearly the last purchaser  within the  State and  as such was liable to pay purchase  tax under Item 71 of the First Schedule to the Kerala General  Sales Tax  Act. Equally it is clear that the assessee could  not be  made liable  to tax on the purchases made by  it prior  to 30th June 1974, unless s the purchases acquired the  quality of  being last purchases in the State. It was  pointed out by this Court in State of Madras v. Shri T. Naral  anaswami Naidu  & Anr.  [1967] 3 S. C. R. 622 when the assessee  ’ files  a return  and declares  the stock  in hand, the  stock in  hand cannot  be said  to have  been ac- quired by last purchase because he may still during the next assessment year, sell it or he may consume it himself or the goods may  be destroyed,  etc. He would be entitled to claim before the  assessing  authorities  that  the  character  of acquisition of  the stock  in hand  was undetermined; in the light of  subsequent vents it may or may not become the last purchase inside  the State."" There can therefore be no doubt that the  assessee in  the present case became liable to pay tax on the purchases made by it prior to 30th June, 1974, as soon as  it became determined though subsequent to 30th June 1974, that  these purchases  were last  purchases inside the State and were consequently exigible to tax. But the  question remains  as to  what is  the rate  at which 1076 the assessee  was liable  to be  taxed in  respect of  these purchases. Since  the purchases  took place before 30th June 1974, the assessee would, in our opinion, liable to be taxed at the  rate prevailing  at the time when the purchases were made and  since the  rate at  that time  was 3%  of the sale price, the  High Court was right in taking the view that the purchases made  by the assessee prior to 30th June 1974 were taxable at  the rate  of 3%. We may point out that a similar view has  been taken  by the  Kerala  High  Court  in  Seaso Rubbers v.  State of  Kerala, 48  S.  T.  C.  256.  We  find ourselves in  agreement with  the reasoning  adopted by  the Full Bench of the High Court in that case. We accordingly  reject the  appeal but with no order as to costs.

" Nanavati, J. The  appellant has been convicted under Section 21  of the  Narcotic  Drugs  and Psychotropic  Substances  Act  and sentenced  to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years  and to  pay  afine  of Rs.l lakh.  His conviction by  the  trial court  has  been  confirmed  by the  High  Court.   He  has, therefore, filed this appeal. The  facts  as  found by the trial court are  that  on 27.12.83,  the appellant was found in possession of 100 mgs. of  brown  sugar.   It was at about 1.25 p.m.  when  he  was passing  on a road.  Though it 1s not very clear as to  what exactly  was  the explanation given him to them, it  appears from  cross-examination  of the witnesses and the  statement recorded  under  Section 313 Cr.P.C.  that he had  purchased the  said quantity from one Mattancharry Rafeeque for a  sum of  Rs,25/-  for  his   personal  consumption.   Though  the quantity found was ’small quantity’, the Trial Court refused to give benefit of Section 27 of the Act to the appellant on the  ground that he had failed to establish that It was  for his  personal consumption.  The Trial Court proceeded on the basis  that  the appellant possessed the same for  sale  and convicted  him under Section 21 of the Act.  The High  Court also  adopted the saroe line of reasoning and confirmed  the finding recorded by the Trial Court. What  1s  contended  by the learned  counsel  for  the appellant  1s  that  the  courts  below  have  not  properly considered   the  defence  raised  by  the  appellant.    He submitted  that even though he had raised the plea that  the quantity  of 100 mgs.  was ’small quantity’ and it was  kept for  his personal consumption, the trial court rejected  the said  plea  on  the ground that no evidence was led  by  the appellant to prove his defence and that if the appellant was an  addict  to brown sugar, one would havs found  withdrawal symptoms in him but no sJch tendencies were exhibited by the appellant at any stage of trial. The  prosecution  had led no evidence to show that  he was  an addict or that he was regularly taking brown  sugar. Therefore,  it  was not proper to reject the defence of  the appellant  on the ground that during the trial the appellant was  in custody and could not have consumed brown sugar  and yet  he did not exhibit withdrawal symptoms.  It is also not in  dispute  that  the quantity which he  was  carrying  was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ’small quantity’.  The value of it was only Rs.25/-.  It is, therefore,  doubtful if such a small quantity was  purchased by him for sale and make any profit out of it.  In any case, there is no evidence on the basis of which such an inference can be drawn.  These aspects have not been considered by the trial  court and the High Court.  We are of the opinion that this appeal deserves to be allowed and the conviction of the appellant  deserves to be altered from Section 21 to Section 27 of the NDPS Act. We  accordingly  allow  this   appeal  and  alter  the conviction  of  the appellant from under Section 21  to  one under Section 27 of the NDPS Act and also alter the sentence of  10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.  1 lakh to  rigorous  imprisonment  for  one  year  and  a  fine  of Rs.5,000/-.   In  default of payment of fine, the  appellant shall  suffer  further  imprisonment for a period  of  three months. The appeal is allowed accordingly.",The appellant was found in possession of 100 mgs. of brown sugar. He was convicted under Section 21 of the Narcotic  Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

" J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. After hearing the learned counsel for the appellant and going through  the judgment  of the High Court, we find that the view  taken by  the High  Court is quite reasonable and, Therefore, it  does not  call for  any interference  by this Court. The  Trial   Court  believed   the  evidence  regarding presence of  accused Kuldip  Singh and  his participation in the assault  on the  deceased. The  High Court  on the other hand has  not believed  his presence  at  the  time  of  the incident. This  is a  finding of  fact and  we have  now  to proceed on  that basis.  Once it is accepted that he was not present, obviously  he could  not have taken any part in the assault on  the deceased  and, therefore,  the  question  of exceeding the  right of  private defence  can not arise. For this reason, the appeal is dismissed.","The High Court has not believed  his presence at the time of the incident.

" O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the Judgment of  the   High  Court  of  Orissa,  made  on  13.9.1993.  in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 384/90. Ballav Kumar Sethi, a young man of 24 years was fatally knocked down by oil Tanker bearing registration No. TCV 667. The appellant claimed a sum of Rs.1 lakh towards the loss of the estate  of the deceased and the support to the appellant as dependent  of the deceased. the claim under section 110-A of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1939 was laid on April 30, 1983. The Tribunal  delivered the  judgment awarding a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/-  to the  appellant which  was confirmed under appeal by the High Court enhancing the same by a further sum of Rs. 18,000\-. The principle  of determination  of the compensation in the case  of fatal  accident was determined by this Court in U.P. State  Road Transport  Corporation &  Ors.  vs.  Trilok Chandra &  ors.   [(19960 4    SCC  362].    This  court  in Paragraph 18 , after considering the tabulations, found that the maximum multiplier of purchaser was as under: ""What   we propose  to emphasise is that the  multiplier cannot  exceed 18 years’  Purchase factor. This is the improvement  over  the  earlier position that ordinarily, it should not  exceed   16.  We   thought  it necessary  to   state  the  correct legal  position     as  courts  and tribunals    are    using    higher multiplier as  in the  present case where   the   Tribunal   used   the multiplier of  24  which  the  High Court raised to 34, thereby showing lack of awareness of the background of the  multiplier system in Davies case."" Thus, we have to conclude that the annual income of the deceased  is  Rs.12,000/-  p.a.  and  he  would  have  spent http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Rs.7,500/- towards  family  members  and  1/3  for  himself; thereby the  annual income  is taken  at Rs.9,000/- per year and multiplier  of 18 years which is the maximum in the case of the young person dying in an accident, has to be applied. The  claimants   would  get   Rs.  1.40  lakhs  towards  the compensation.   Since the claim is limited to Rs 1 lakh, the claimants  are entitled to get Rs. 1 lakh, the claimants are entitled to  Rs.1 lakh,  the claimants  are entitled  to get Rs.1 lakh  as compensation with interest at 6% p.a. from the date of the judgment of the High court.

" J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 26765 of 2005) ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the application for review filed in respect of the order in CWP No.17615 of 2001 which was dismissed on 12.8.2005. The said writ petition was dismissed on the ground that the writ petitioner was absent for about three years. The High Court found the writ petitioner to be a habitual absentee and, therefore, felt that he did not deserve any relief in the quantum of punishment.  It is to be noted that while issuing notice on 6.11.2001 the following order had been passed by the High Court: ""Learned counsel for the petitioner at the time of arguments stated that the petitioner has put in ten years of service and he has been deprived of the retiral benefits in view of the impugned order. He confines the prayer in the writ petition only to the quantum of punishment."" Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court is not right in holding that the review petition was not entertainable in view of the materials which were placed for consideration. Those materials clearly show that the High Court did not take note of the correct factual position while dismissing the writ petition.

Challenge in this appeal is only to the order passed in the review application.  Such an appeal is not maintainable. In Shanker Motiram Nale v.

In the impugned order ultimately the Division Bench of the High Court passed the following order: ""In the result, the writ petition is allowed.

It is also an admitted position that an application for recall of that ex-parte order passed by the School Tribunal has already been filed at the instance of the  appellant,  which has not yet been decided. ::2:: If that application is allowed and the order is recalled, there cannot be any dispute that the right that has been accrued to the present respondent shall automatically come to an end.

" O R D E R The petitioner  and the 8th respondent had filed a suit for perpetual  injunction restraining the respondents 1 to 7 from dispossessing  them from the suit land or part thereof. Respondents/defendants   filed    the   written    statement contending that  the petitioner  and the  8th respondent had trespassed into their land of an extent of 3 kanals and they are in  unlawful possession.  Thereby, they  raised  counter claim, in  the written  statement, for possession. The Trial Court, while dismissing the suit of the petitioners, granted decree for  possession of  two kanals,  two marlas  and  one biswas  comprising  survey  numbers  mentioned  therein.  On appeal, it  was confirmed and the High Court confirmed it in R.S.A. No.1190/94  on May  18, 1995. Thus this Special Leave Petition. The contention raised in the courts below was that in a suit for perpetual injunction, the respondents could not lay any counter  claim for  possession. Order  8 Rule 6(A)(1) of the C.P.C., 1908 as amended in 1976 reads thus: ""A defendant  in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a set-off under Rule 6,  set up  by way of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiffs, any right or  claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either before or after the filing  of   the  suit  but  before  the defendant has  delivered his  defence or before the  time limited  for delivering his defence  has expired,  whether  such counter-claim is  in  the  nature  of  a claim for damages or not:- Provided that  such counter-claim  shall not exceed  the pecuniary  limits of the jurisdiction of the Court."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It is  true that  Rule 6A(a) was introduced by Amendment Act of 1976.  Preceding the  amendment, it  was settled law that except in  a money claim, counter claim or set off cannot be set up  in other  suits. The  Law Commission  of  India  had recommended, to avoid multiplicity of the proceedings, right to the  defendants to  raise the plea of set off in addition to a  counter claim  in Rule 6 in the same suit irrespective of the fact whether the cause of action for counter claim or set off  had accrued to defendant either before or after the filing of  the suit.  The limitation  was that  the  counter claim or  set off  must be  pleaded by way of defence in the written statement  before the  defendant filed  his  written statement or  before  the  time  limit  for  delivering  the written statement has expired, whether such counter-claim is in the  nature of  a  claim  for  damages  or  not.  Further limitation was  that the counter-claim should not exceed the pecuniary limits  of the jurisdiction of the court. In other words, by laying the counter claim pecuniary jurisdiction of the court  cannot be  divested and the power to try the suit already entertained  cannot be  taken away  by accepting the counter  claim  beyond  its  pecuniary  jurisdiction..  Thus considered, we  hold that  in a  suit  for  injunction,  the counter-claim for  possession also  could be entertained, by operation of Order 8 Rule 6 (A)(1) of CPC. It is sought to be contended that the counter-claim was not filed  within the  time given  for laying  the same.  It would appear  from the  list  of  the  dates  given  by  the petitioner himself  that the  counter-claim was filed within two months from the date of the suit itself.

" O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the order of the  Division  Bench  of  the  Patna  High  Court,  made  on 11.09.1996 in LPA No. 788/95. The admitted position is that the appellants came to be appointed as  Assistant Engineers  on daily  wages @ Rs.40/- per day on November 16, 1987. Subsequently, they were placed in the pay scale of Rs.880-1510/- per month, They came to be selected by  conducting examinations  and the  appointments, accordingly, came  to be  made. An  attempt was  made by 2nd respondent, Regional Development Authority to regularise the service and  the proposal  was sent  to the  Government  for acceptance.  The   Government  accepting  the  proposal  had referred the  Public service Commission did not agree to the regularisation of  their services, the appellants filed writ petition in  the High  Court for  a mandamus  directing  the authority to  regularise their  services. The  High Court in the impugned  order refused  to give  directions, Thus, this appeal by special leave. Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, learned senior counsel appearing for the  appellants, contends that Section 6(3) of the Bihar Regional Development  Authority Act,  1981 (  for short, the ‘Act’  )  gives  power  to  the  Authority  to  appoint  the Secretary and other officers and employees of the Authority. Under proviso  thereto, the  appointing  Authority  has  the power to  appoint any  person for a period not exceeding six months on  any post carrying the minimum salary of Rs. 500/- and above  after approval  of the  State Government  and the appointment though  for six months will be on regular basis. The authority  has not made any statutory rules for the mode of recruitment.  The advertisement  did  not  indicate  that these were temporary appointments. Therefore, the appellants are entitled  to be  regularised in  the service. We find no force in the contention. Section 6(3)  of the Act only empowers the Authority to appoint the  Secretary, and  other officers and employees of the Authority.  The  power  under  the  proviso  is  only  a breathing  elbow  power  given  to  the  Authority  to  make temporary appointments  so that  the work of the Development http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Authority goes  on pending  recruitment. Therefore, when the advertisement was made for the recruitment, it was obviously in furtherance  of the  recruitment,  it  was  obviously  in furtherance of  the power  flown under  the  proviso  for  a limited period. Thereby, the appointments obviously are only temporary  appointments   had  sought   assistance  of   the Government for  regularisation which  was negatived  by  the Public Service  Commission. It  is seen that these posts are within  the   purview  of  the  Public  Service  Commission. Therefore, the  Government sought  the  concurrence  of  the Public Service  Commission and the Public Service Commission had not  concurred and,  in our  view,  correctly  with  the request   made    by   the    Government.   Therefore,   any regularisation in violation of the recruitment to be made by the Public  Service Commission  is in  contravention of  the law. The  High Court  therefore, rightly  did not  issue any mandamus  for   regularisation  of   the  services  made  in contravention of  the Rules  to violate  and no  mandamus or direction would be issued to violate law.

" O R D E R The plaintiff  in O.S.  No.  178  of  1958,  Additional Munsiff Court,  Ernakulam --  appellant in  S.A. No.  669 of 1976 --  is the  appellant in  this  appeal.  The  appellant belongs to  Edappally Padinjare  Warriam. His main prayer in the suit  was to  declare that  the  appellant’s  family  is entitled to  do Kazhakam  services in the two temples as the family has hereditary rights in that regard. The trial court held that  the plaintiff  or his family had no Karaima right (hereditary right)  in the  temples as claimed. It is stated in the appeal memorandum that both the courts held thus:- ""(i)....the plaintiff’s  family has been performing  the  Kazhakam  (2) the  plaintiff’s  family  had  been given Mala Virthy by the swaroopam, (3) that the plaintiff’s family has been performing the Kazhakam in the two temples  from  time  immemorial for  which   they  had  been  given viruthy tenure. But  after   recording  all   these findings  concurrently  the  courts also  held   that  the  plaintiff’s family has  no hereditary right for the  performance  of  Kazhakam  and that the  plaintiff could  be hired and fired  at the sweet will by the defendant                    No.1."" 2.   The appellant  filed S.A. bio. 669 of 1976 and assailed the judgments  and decrees  of the courts below. The learned single Judge  of the  High Court,  in  paragraph  2  of  the judgment, observed thus:- ""2.   So  far as the main relief of granting  a  declaration  that  the plaintiff’s  tarward  has  got  the right to do kazhakam service in the two   temples    in   question   is concerned, it  appears to  me  that that relief  is now  irrelevant  in view  of  the  Kerala  Joint  Hindu http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Family System (Abolition) Act 1975, Acc 30  of 1976. That Act abolishes the joint tenancy of tarward and it can  no   more.  to  be  said  that marumakkathayam tarward  with joint tenancy as  its feature  exists any move. In  that view  no declaration can  be  given  in  favour  of  the tarward  as   sought  for   by  the plaintiff. That is the basic relief sought for,  the other  reliefs are based on that relief."" (emphasis supplied) However, the  court granted  a decree  for recovery  of Rs.100/- from  the first defendant and a slight modification was thus  made. The  sum of Rs.100/- was paid in lieu of the notice, for the termination of the service of the appellant. 3.   We heard  counsel. The  appellant has  not  sought  any amendment of  the plaint either in the High Court or in this Court. The  main prayer is for grant of declaration that the appellant’s  tarwad   (family)  has  the  right  to  perform Kazhakam services  in the  two temples.  The High  Court was right in  holding  that  the  Kerala  Act  30  of  1976  has abolished the  joint family  system. The  tarwad has  become extinct. No  declaration can  be given  in favour  of a non- existing entity.  On this  aspect, We  concur with  the High Court and dismiss this appeal with no order as to costs. However, as  to whether the Karaima right (or the hereditary right ) will devolve on the members of the erstwhile tarward as tenants in common does not arise for consideration in the present appeal. The said issue is left open",The appeal was filed by Edappally Padinjare Warriam. He wanted to declare that his family was entitled to do Kazhakam services in the two temples.

" O R D E R Delay Condoned. Application for  amendment in  substitution application is allowed. The snort  question that  arose for  decision  in  this appeal is  whether the  High Court  has correctly decided by the impugned  judgment in  S.A. No.  115 of  1968  that  the appeal  preferred   by  the   appellant-Municipal   Council, Mandsaur stood  abated  in  view  of  the  fact  that  legal representatives of  one of the co-owners were not brought on record  when   the  appeal  was  pending  before  the  lower appellate court. It may  be stated  were that initially three plaintiffs being droners  claiming to  be the owners of the joint Hindu family property,  filed a  suit against  Municipal  Council. Mandsaur for a permanent injunction by asserting their title to the  property. Such  suit was  decreed by the trial court and the  Municipality thereafter  preferred an appeal before the lower  appellate court.  During  the  pungency  of  such appeal. one of the three brothers had died. The Municipality did not  bring the  heirs and  legal representatives  of the deceased brother  on record  despite knowledge of such death but made  an application  that  the  name  of  the  deceased brother should  be deleted  from the  array of  parties. The question thereafter  was raised  by the remaining plaintiffs that the  appeal had abated as a whole because the heirs and legal representatives  of one  of the co-owners had not been brought on  record. Such  contention has  ben upheld  by the impugned decision. Mr. S.K. Gambhir, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has  contended before  us that since in the plaint the plaintiffs  had stated  that the  property was  a  joint Hindu family  property, such  property must  be deemed to be represented by  the Karta  of the  joint family  and as  the eldest brother  was alive,  it must  be held that such joint Hindu family  property was represented by the eldest brother and in  that case, there was no question of abatement of the appeal as a whole. We are  however unable to accept such contention of Mr. Gambhir for  the reason  that from the statement made in the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 plaint it  cannot be  definitely held  that the property was coparceners property  which could be represented by a karta. It has  been alleged  in the  plaint that after the death of the father, all the three partners became owners of the said joint Hindu  family property.  It may be indicated were that if it  was a  codarcenery property  then the sons would have been codarceners  even before  the death  of the  father and there was  no necessity to wait will the death of the father to get  ownership of  the property.  The  averments  in  the plaint really  means that  the  disputed  property  was  the undivided property  of the  saic three  joint owners who had inherited the father’s interest after his death. That apart, even it is assumed that it was codarcenary property there is nothing an  record to  indicate that  any one  member or the eldest male  member of  the family  was acting as a karta of the joint  family. On  the contrary, it appears that all the co-owners filed  the said  suit for injunction, which on the face of  it, only  indicates that  all  of  them  intent  to exercise their  right as  co-owners of the property and they have not  authorised  any  one  of  them  to  represent  the property as  a karta  of the joint Hindu family property. In the aforesaid  circumstances, the decision of the High Court cannot be saic to be erroneous for which any interference by this Court  is called  for. The appeal, therefore, falls and is dismissed without any order as to costs.",Three droners claimed to be the owners of the joint Hindu family property. They filed a suit against Municipal  Council.

" JUDGEMENT QYADRI, J. The appellant and two others, namely, Daljeet  Singh and  Ganeshi  were tried for offences, under Section 302 and Section 302 r/w Section 34 I.P.C.  by the learned Additional Session Judge No.1, Sri Ganganagar.   The  gravamen  of  the charge  against them was that the said three persons came on a motor cycle; Ganeshi and the other caught hold of  Kailash Soni and  exhorted  Daljeet  Singh  to  strike him.  On that Daljeet Singh gave 2-3 blows with his kripan to kailash Soni which  resulted  in  his  instantaneous  death  (hereinafter referred to as ’the deceased’).  On considering the evidence produced  by the prosecution, the learned Additional Session Judge convicted Daljeet Singh under Section  302;  appellant and  Ganesh  under  Section  302 read with Section 34 I.P.C. and sentenced each one of them to life imprisonment and fine of Rupees  five  hundred,  in  default  thereof  to  further undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.  Against their conviction  and  sentence,  they  filed  appeal  in the High Court.  By judgment and order of March 17,  1992,  the  High Court  upheld the conviction and order of the High Court, by special leave the appellant has filed this appeal. Mr.   Jayant  Bhushan,  the  learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that as the only overt  act  attributed to  him was that he caught hold of the deceased and exhorted Daljeet by saying ’Maro"", so it cannot be  said  that  there was common  intention  to  kill the deceased:  the appellant only said ’Maro’, which did not mean ’to  kill’,  therefore, he  ought  not to have been convicted under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.   To  examine  the  contention  of  the learned  counsel,  we  have  perused  the  First Information Report and the  statement  of  Mohan  Mujral  (pw-1).    The relevant allegation in the F.I.R.  reads as follows: ""At this both Pappu  (appellant)  and  Ganeshi  said strike at his Daljit"". PW - 1 deposed before the Court. ""when  we  raised  the  alarm, both Pappu Pandit and Ganeshi  instigated  Daljit  Singh  ""Strike’.   They exhorted  him  to  strike at Kailash. At this Daljit took out a short kripan from under the stockings  he http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 had worn. He, then, in a jiffy struck at Kailash 2-3 blows on the left portion of his body’. Thus,  from the averments in the FIR as well as from the statement of PW-1, it cannot be said that the  appellant had shared  common  intention  to  kill  the  deceased.  The appellant might not have been known that Daljeet  Singh  was having a  kripan  under  his stockings.  The instigation was only ’to strike’ and as such his  conviction  under  Section 302 read  with  Section 34 IPC is not sustainable.  [See Jai Narain Mishra vs.  State of Bihar (AIR  1972  SC  1764)  and Matadio vs.    State  of  Maharashtra (Jt 1998 (5) SC 264)]. The conviction of the appellant under  Section  302/34,  IPC is,  therefore,  set  aside;  instead  he is convicted under Section 324 read with Section 110 IPC and sentenced  to  the period already  undergone.    His  bail  bonds  shall  stand cancelled and he be released forthwith unless he is required to be incarcarated  in  any  other  case.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment dated April  2, 1979  of the  Punjab & Haryana High Court in L.P.A. No.521  of 1975. The Division Bench of the High Court has gone  into the  genuineness  of  the  Will  executed  by Bhagwana on  October 15, 1957. Bhagwana died on September 2, 1958. The  appellant laid  claim over  the property  of  her father. The  trial Court  and the appellate Court upheld the Will and  denied the  relief. Learned single Judge in Second Appeal No.451  of 1972 by order dated September 16, 1975 set aside the  judgment and  granted the  decree. In the Letters Patent Appeal  the Division Bench restored the decree of the trial Court  dismissing  the  suit.  Thus,  this  appeal  by special leave. Learned counsel  for  the  appellant,  after  elaborate preparation of  the facts, though of complicated nature, has contended  that   in  the   first  litigation   between  the collaterals the  appellant, the  appellant was  not a party. The courts  below, having  held that  there is  no proof  of collateralship, ought  not to have gone into the genuineness of the  Will and  record a  finding  in  that  behalf.  Even otherwise, the  finding does  not find the appellant a party to the  earlier suit. In this suit, admittedly, however, the Will was  not produced  and one  of the  testators  was  not examined. Learned  single Judge of the High Court found that the execution  of the  Will  was  shrouded  with  suspicious circumstances. The burden  is on  the propounder of the Will to remove all the  doubts regarding  the genuineness  of the Will and, therefore, the  Division Bench,  the trial Court as also the appellate Court were not right in cognising the Will. Having considered the  contention with reference to the evidence on record and  the findings  recorded by the Division Bench and also the  trial Court and the appellate Court, we are of the view that  the view  taken by  the Division  Bench cannot be http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 said to  be unwarranted.  It is  the case of the respondents that the  Will was  lost. Consequently, permission was given to  lead  secondary  evidence  and  on  the  basis  thereof, secondary evidence was laid by the parties and the witnesses were examined  in proof of the Will and in rebuttal thereof. The trial  court and the appellate Court have considered all the facts and circumstances and have recorded a finding that the Will  was executed  by Bhagwana  in favour  of Atma  Ram respondent No.1. On a  finding of  fact, though the learned single Judge could  go   into  the  question  of  law,  he  confined  his consideration in  a second appeal under a limited parameter. It would appear that the learned single Judge trenched as if he was the first appellate court and considered the evidence by himself  and came  to the conclusion that the genuineness of the  Will  had  not  been  proved.  The  Division  Bench, therefore, has  rightly gone  into the  question within  the parameters of law and held that the learned single Judge was not right  in reversing  the finding of fact recorded by the trial Court  and the appellate Court. Thus, we consider that there  is   no  substantial   question  of   law  warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment dated April 2, 1979 of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in L.P.A. No.521  of 1975.

" RAJENDRA BABU, J.  : This  Writ  Petition is filed under Article 32 of  the Constitution  of India challenging conviction under  Section 193  Indian Penal Code (IPC) in a proceeding arising in Writ Petition  (Criminal)  Nos.  356-57 of 1993.  On January  17, 1996  an order was made by this Court on receipt of  reports from the District Judge, Faridabad and the Central Bureau of Investigation  and  after  issue of a notice as to  why  the petitioner should not be convicted for forgery of signatures of  Shri  M.S.   Ahlawat, Superintendent of  Police  on  the affidavits  dated November 2, 1993 and November 5, 1993  and also  for  contempt  of  this  Court  for  furnishing  false evidence.  Thereafter, this Court passed an order on January 17,  1996 whereby the petitioner was held to have  committed the  offences under Section 193 IPC and he was sentenced  to undergo imprisonment for three months.  It is brought to our notice  that  the petitioner has served out this  period  of imprisonment.  Along with the petitioner Shri M.S.  Ahlawat, Superintendent  of  Police,  was also convicted  in  similar circumstances.  He filed a Writ Petition (Criminal) No.  353 of  1997  challenging his conviction under Section 193  IPC. On  October  27,  1999, we allowed the  said  Writ  Petition (Criminal)  No.  353 of 1997 by setting aside the conviction under  Section  193  IPC.   By  accepting  the  plea  as  to non-compliance with the procedure required under Section 195 Cr.P.C.   read with Section 340 Cr.P.C.  and also on account of  want  of  original jurisdiction of this Court to  try  a criminal  offence  under Section 193 IPC, we held  that  the punishment  was liable to be quashed.  The situation in  the present  case  is identical on this aspect.   Following  the said  judgment  and  for  the  reasons  stated  therein  the sentence  imposed upon the petitioner under Section 193  IPC is also liable to be quashed. At  this stage, the petitioner has filed an affidavit, inter  alia,  stating :- That I undertake to  this  Honble Court  that in case my conviction U/s 193 IPC is set-aside I will  not claim any compensation or initiate any proceedings before  this Honble Court or any other court arising out of my  conviction  U/s  193  IPC  or for  the  sentence  I  had undergone  pursuant to the said conviction, save and  except http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 using  any order passed by this Honble Court, setting aside my  conviction  U/s 193 IPC in any proceedings initiated  by State in relation to my service in the Haryana Police and/or any departmental proceedings. Considering  the  special features of the case, we  do not  think that this is a fit case to direct the filing of a complaint in the competent court as envisaged by Section 340 Cr.P.C.   because  the petitioner has already undergone  the sentence  imposed upon him for an offence under Section  193 IPC although set aside now by this order. Therefore,  we  set  aside  the  order  made  in  Writ Petitions  (Criminal)  Nos.  356-57 of 1993  convicting  the petitioner  under  Section 193 IPC and is recalled.   It  is made clear that this order will not enable the petitioner to claim  any  compensation or initiate any proceedings in  any court  arising  out of his conviction under Section 193  IPC except  to use the same in any proceeding initiated  against the petitioner departmentally regarding his services","The petition was filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India challenging conviction under Section 193  Indian Penal Code (IPC) The petitioner was convicted for forgery of signatures of Shri M.S.

" O R D E R I.A. is dismissed.

The petitioner was appointed on January 15, 1990 in the pay-scale   of    Rs.550-1100/=   with    allowance;   total remuneration  was  coming  to  Rs.1991.40.  He  was  put  on probation as  contemplated under clause (2) of the letter of appointment which reads as under: ""You will  be on  probation  for  a period of  12 months  from  date of your joining,  which period  may be extended from  time to  time at the discretion   of   the   Management. During  the  period  of  probation, your  services  may  be  terminated without   assigning    any   reason therefore."" His service was terminated by proceedings dated January 16, 1991 which reads as under: ""During  the  period  of  probation your  work  performance  was  found unsatisfactory.    Therefore,  your services are hereby terminated with effect  from  16  Jan.  91  as  per clause  (2)   of  your  appointment letter referred to above."" The petitioner  challenged the  order of termination in the High  Court. The  High  Court  without  going  into  the question whether or not it is stigma, came to the conclusion that the  respondents had  totally lost  confidence  in  the appellant and  that he was totally unsuitable to the job for which he  was employed  and, therefore,  he  was  found  not entitled to any enquiry. Consequently, it dismissed the writ petition.  Shri  Sehgal,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the petitioner, contends  that the finding recorded amounts to a stigma; action  taken without  conducting enquiry and giving an opportunity  to the  petitioner, is  violative of Article http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 311(2) of  the Constitution  and the  rules made thereunder. Therefore, he  is entitled  to an opportunity of being heard and be dismissed only on the ground of misconduct and not by termination simpliciter.  We do  not agree  with the learned counsel. The order may be a motive and not a foundation as a ground for  dismissal. During  the period  of probation, the authorities are entitled to assess the suitable to remain in service  they   are  entitled   to  record   a  finding   of unsatisfactory performance of the work and duties during the period of  probation. Under  these circumstance, necessarily the appointing authority has to look into the performance of the work  and duties  during the  period of probation and if they record a finding that during that probation period, the work and performance of the duties were unsatisfactory, they are entitled to terminate the service in terms of the letter of appointment without conducting any enquiry. That does not amount to  any stigma. If the record does not support such a conclusion reached  by the authorities, different complexion would arise.  In this  case, they  have recorded the finding that the  petitioner was  regularly absent  on one ground or the  other.   Under  these  circumstances,  the  respondents terminated his  services. We  do not  find any illegality in the action taken by the respondents.

Sd/- Chief Executive Officer Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad"" Pursuant to show-cause notice, he proceeded on leave.  Thereafter, his whereabouts was not known for about 16 years.  It appears, for the first time, he filed writ petition in 1987 challenging the show-cause notice dated 13/11/1964, i.e. after a lapse of about 23 years.  The said writ petition was subsequently withdrawn.  In the meantime, the respondent expired on 3/1/1988.  His legal representatives filed a second writ petition on 28/1/1988 praying the same relief which was prayed in the first writ petition.  In the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 second writ petition, the order dated 30/11/1987 compulsorily retiring the respondent from service was also challenged.  The High Court, by its impugned order, allowed the writ petition.  The High Court quashed the order dated 30/11/1987 compulsorily retiring the deceased respondent from service. The High Court also held .......3. - 3 - that the deceased respondent was deemed to have continued in service from 14/6/1965 till 20/8/1982 and retired on attaining the age of superannuation on 20/8/1982.  The High Court directed the appellant to pay full pay and allowances for the period from 14/6/1965 to 20/8/1982 including the arrears on account of revision of pay scales during the aforesaid period after adjusting the amount already paid to him. The relief granted by the High Court, in our view, is unknown to law.  Undisputed facts are that the deceased respondent was found absent from 13/11/1964 till he filed a writ petition in 1987 challenging the order of show-cause notice dated 13/11/1964 that was withdrawn.  Subsequent writ petition filed by the legal representatives of the respondent was also based on the same cause of action, save and except, that in the second writ petition the order dated 30/11/1987 compulsorily retiring the respondent was also challenged.  In our view, in the facts and circumstances as recited above, the writ petition was clearly not maintainable being barred by laches and negligence.  The High Court ought not have entertained the writ petition much less granting such relief unknown to law.  The relief granted under Article 226 of the Constitution is discretionary relief.  This was not a fit case for the High Court to have exercised its discretion under Article 226 for granting relief. .......4. - 4 - For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside.

" O R D E R Leave granted. Though the  respondent has  been served by dasti, he is not appearing either in person or through counsel. The facts are eloquent.  In a  suit for  ejectment filed  on April  5, 1984, the  respondent had  entered into a compromise on foot of which the decree for eviction was granted after recording the compromise  and evidence. The respondent did not deliver the possession  of the  demised property  in  terms  of  the compromise decree.  Therefore, the appellant was constrained to lay  execution for  possession of  the property.  In  the first round  of litigation,  the respondent  had  challenged under section  47 of the C.P.C impugning the validity of the compromise decree  which was  turned down  by the  executing Court. The  High Court  dismissed W.P.  No.2849 of  1994  by order dated  August 19,  1994.  Again  the  respondent  laid another objection  under  Section  47  contending  that  the decree is  vague and  incapable of  being executed. That was turned down  by the  executing Court  on September 30, 1994. Against that,  the respondent  filed a  revision in the High Court. The  High Court  in the  impugned order  allowed  the revision by  order dated  June 21,  1995 in  C.R. No.1252/94 since  the   counsel  for  the  appellant  had  reported  no instructions. The  only   question  is:  whether  the  respondent  is entitled to raise the plea of vagueness? Having entered into the compromise  and suffered  a decree on foot of compromise and also  having raised the plea of non-executability of the compromise decree  and having  become  unsuccessful,  he  is precluded by constructive res judicata of might and ought in Explanation VI to Section 11, to raise any other plea of the executability of  the decree. The High Court, therefore, was clearly in  error in allowing the revision and setting aside the Execution Application. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed.

In a writ petition filed as a Public Interest Litigation, the petitioner alleged tha t the public way to Mandir of Lord Khatushyamji in village Khatushyamji, Danta Ramgarh Tehsil, was encroached by shop keepers. The High Court entertained the writ petition and interim directions were issued from time to time monitoring the steps for maintaining the pathway free of encroachments. In fact, by an interim order dated 16.4.2004, the High Court directed the Collector, Sikar, to explore the possibility of having the shops constructed on the Road to the Mandir opened on the other side of the Road. In pursuance of the said order, the concerned Sub-Divisional Officer held a meeting with the shop keepers and made certain suggestions. The Report accepted the grievance of the appellant that the public path to the Mandir was narrowed considerably by reason of the shop keepers using part of the pathway. -2- 2.      However, when the matter came up before another Division Bench on 25.2.2005, the writ petition was abruptly disposed of by a non-speaking order with the observation that no public interest was involved in the writ petition. 3.      The learned counsel for the appellant rightly submitted that the High Court should have considered the contentions of the appellant and disposed of the same by a reasoned order.

" J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot of land in July 1991.    The Respondent paid all dues.  Yet possession was not delivered.  The Respondent thus filed a complaint. The District Forum directed payment of interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of deposit to the date of payment.   The District Court also awarded payments of Rs.5,000/- for mental agony and Rs.1,000/- as costs. The State Forum confirmed the Award, in the Appeal filed by the Appellants. The Respondent did not go in Revision before the National Commission. The Appellants filed a Revision before the National Commission.  For the first time they now claimed that the Karpuripuram Scheme was cancelled.  The National Commission has not dealt with the aspect of cancellation of Scheme but awarded interest at the rate of 18% per annum. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 As stated in the Judgment, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra), where the Scheme is cancelled interest must be paid at the rate of 18%.  The Respondent is thus entitled to get back his money with interest at the rate of 18% p.a.  It is claimed by the Appellants that they have paid interest at the rate of 18% p.a. to the Respondent.  The Respondent complains that interest at the rate of 18% has not been paid from the date each amount was deposited with the Appellants.  He handovers to this Court and to the Advocate of the Appellants calculation showing what amount has remained payable. The Appellants are directed to recalculate and pay to the Respondent interest at the rate of 18% p.a. on the deposits made by the Respondent from the date of each deposit till payment.  It is clarified that amounts, if any, paid would first go towards payment/repayment of interest and the balance, if any, towards principle.     The Appellants must, along with their payment, handover to the Respondent the calculation sheet showing how they have calculated the interest amount. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter having been passed on account of the special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

" JUDGMENT ORDER We have heard learned counsels for the parties. Delay condoned. Leave granted. This appeal is barred by time by 260 days. Ordinarily we may not have condoned such a long delay, and we do not appreciate the delays caused in filing Special Leave Petitions by the Government before this Court. Such kind of delay causes grave injustice to the parties. However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, we condone the delay. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 14th July 2005 passed by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, Jaipur in D.B. Criminal Leave to appeal No. 165 of 2005 whereby the Division Bench of the High Court had passed a cryptic order dismissing the application for leave to appeal against as acquittal judgment without giving proper reasons and without showing due application of mind. While disposing of an application for leave to appeal against an acquittal, it is expected that the High Court should pass a speaking order showing due application of mind. Of Course the said order need not be as elaborate as a full fledged judgment, but at least briefly some reasons should be given. That has not been done in this case. Hence we cannot sustain the impugned order dated 14th July 2005 passed by the High Court. We set aside the order of the High Court and remit the matter back to the High Court for passing an order after showing due application of mind.

" JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (4) SCR 135 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.M. SAHAI, J. The short question of law that arises for consideration in this appeal directed against the judgment and order of the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi, is whether the classification and the price list accepted by the Department and acted upon, found subsequently to be erroneous, is to be applied prospectively Or retrospectively. The appellant, a manufacturer of dye-stuff, filed a price list in.-Part IV proforma as applicable for sales to related persons. The price list showed various includible and excludible expenses as well as assessable value as claimed by the appellant. This was approved by the Department on 6th December 1975 and the assessable value as declared was accepted. The approval was to be effective from 1st October 1975. After nearly a year the Assistant Collector issued a show cause notice requiring the appellant to show cause as to why the net assessable value as per the method shown in the annexure should not be revised and differential duty recovered from the appellant. The reply of the appellant was not accepted either by the Assistant Collector Or by the appellate Collector or the Tribunal. In fact before the Tribunal it was conceded on behalf of the appellant that the method for determining the assessable value in the price list submitted by the appellant was not correct. The order of the Tribunal was challenged and it was urged that the classification and the price list submitted by the appellant having been accepted and acted upon under Rule 173(2) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 the Department precluded the appellant from challenging it and, therefore, it is estopped froth claiming that the appellant was guilty of suppression of facts. The learned counsel urged that the classification and the price list having been accepted and acted upon, the Department was not justified in taking proceedings under Section 11A of the Central Excises & Salt Act, 1944. ft was also urged that the Department could not have changed its opinion and the law does not contemplate  issuing of any notice only because the Department felt that a particular item was dutiable in another entry. In the alternative the learned counsel submitted that where the Department has been acting upon the price list submitted by the appellant worked out in one manner but the Department claims that it should be calculated in a different manner then even if the calculation resorted to by the Department is held to be correct it should apply from the date of issue of notice and not from the date when the price list was submitted. Reliance for it was placed on the order passed by this Court in Civil Appeal Nos. 1960-61 of 1988 in the case of Collector of Central Excises, Calcutta Vs. Indian Oxygen Ltd., Khardah, Decided on 17th March, 1989-1990 (48) E.L.T. A 24. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Since the appellant did not dispute that the method of calculation of the duty by the department was correct, the submission of the learned counsel on lack of jurisdiction to initiate proceedings  is not necessary to be decided as the power to issue show-cause notice vests even if the duty was short- levied as a result of erroneous application of law. However, once the Department accepted the price list, acted upon it and the goods were cleared with the knowledge of the Department, then in absence of any amendment in law or judicial  pronouncement  the reclassification should be effective from the date the Department issued the show-cause notice. The reason for it is clearance with the knowledge of the Department and no intention to evade payment of duty. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is allowed in part. The appellant is held liable  to pay duty on the dye-stuffs manufactured by ii in the mariner calculated by the Department from 16th October, 1976, the date the show-cause notice was issued to the appellant.

" O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard counsel on both sides. The appellant  admittedly is  the original  owner of an extent of  18 canals  and marlas  of land.  In his  suit for declaration and  injunction, the  Trial  Court  decreed  the suit, but  on appeal,  it was  reversed. The  High Court  of Punjab and  Haryana in  Second Appeal No.600/95 on March 15, 1995 confirmed the same. The admitted  facts are  that the  appellant being  the owner, had  sold the property to the respondent. By the date of the  sale, admittedly,  it was  subject to  hypothecation with a  bank for a sum of Rs.5,OOO/- that the respondent had to discharge.  The appellant had paid three installments, as evidenced by  the statement  of Gurdial  Singh, the clerk of the Primary  Agricultural  Bank,  Hoshiarpur.  It  was  also proved through  his evidence  that Ranjit Singh had paid the amount in  three instalments; one in the year 1975, other in December, 1976  and the  third one  in December,  1977.  One payment was  also made by Baljit Singh and final payment was made by  the appellant  himself on December 18, 1979. It is, thus, his case that he has discharged the loan taken by him, though the  sale was  executed in  favour of the respondent. The sale being a conditional sale, as the respondent had not complied with  the conditions,  he is not bound by the sale. He has  also pleaded  that he perfected his title by adverse possession. The  respondent pleaded in the written statement that the  sale was for consideration and he had got the sale transferred in  his name;  he  has  legal  possession;  and, therefore, injunction  cannot be  granted. The  trial  Court relied upon  the payments  made  by  Ranjit  Singh  s/o  the appellant and  that he  had paid  the amount. On that basis, the trial  Court came to the conclusion that the respondents have not discharged the loan. In view  of the  specific evidence  of  Gurdial  Singh, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 clerk of  the Bank,  it is  obvious that the entire loan was discharged by  the appellant  himself. It is not the case of the  appellant  that  he  had  advanced  the  money  to  the respondent for  discharge and  on his  behalf, the appellant had paid  the debt  to the Bank. In that view of the matter, it is  obvious that  the sale  being a conditional sale, the respondent had  not complied  with the  condition, the  sale became voidable which is not in dispute. In all the mutation entries in  the Revenue  Records, the  name of the appellant continued as  the  owner.  If  really,  the  respondent  had discharged the  loans, one  would expect  that he would have got his  name mutated  in the Revenue Records. He never made such an  attempt which  would clearly  show that  he had not discharged the loan to the Primary Bank subject to which the sale was  made. The  appellate Court and the High Court have not approached  the problem  in the  proper  perspective  in reversing the decree of the trial Court. The appeal  is allowed. Judgment and decree of the High Court in  Second Appeal  and that of the appellate Court are set aside  and that of the trial Court is restored. The suit stands decreed as prayed for.

" ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition (C) No. 1269 of 1989. 2 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India). K.M. Sharma petitioner-in-person. Soli  J.  Sorabjee,  Attorney  General,  Santosh  Hegde, Additional Solicitor General, A.K. Sen, Manbir Singh, Girish Chandra and Ms. A. Subhashini for the Respondents. The Court delivered the following order: ORDER Two  contentions were raised by the petitioner  in  this writ petition challenging the appointment of Respondent  No. 1, Shri Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister of India: (i)  that  the oath administered to him as  Deputy  Prime Minister  was not the oath in accordance with the  prescrip- tion of the Constitution; and (ii)  he was still functioning as the Chief  Minister  of Haryana  when the oath of office of his new  assignment  was administered to him. Pursuant to notice, two affidavits have been  filed--one by the Respondent No. 1 and the other on behalf of the Union of  India.  In  the affidavit of Respondent  No.  1  certain precedents have been relied upon and the practice which  has been followed eversince the Constitution came into force has been referred to. Learned  Attorney  General appearing on  behalf  of  the Union  of India has stated that the form prescribed  in  the Third Schedule pursuant to the requirement of Article  75(4) of the Constitution is only for a Minister of the Union  and there is no separate form even for the Prime Minister. Since the Prime Minister is also a member of the Council of Minis- ters,  he  takes the same oath as the  other  ministers  are required to take. He maintains that yet in view of the  fact that  the Constitution describes him as the Prime  Minister, while being sworn into office, he describes himself as Prime Minister and this practice is in  vogue eversince 1950.  The oath  register is by the incumbent signed as Prime  Minister and all other ministers sign as Ministers. He further  indi- cates that describing Shri Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister is  descriptive only and for all purposes he is  a  Minister and there is no 3 constitutional sanction for the post of Deputy Prime  Minis- ter as such. Relying on a bench decision of this Court in the case of Virji Ram Sutaria v. Nathalal Premji Bhavadia & Ors., [1969] 2  SCR 627, learned Attorney General further  contends  that the  prescribed oath should be divided into two  parts,  one which  is descriptive and the other which contains the  sub- stantial  part.  And  according  to  him,  as  long  as  the substantial  part  is properly followed, a mere  mistake  or error in the --descriptive part would not vitiate the oath. This Court in the reported decision said: ""In  this  case,  as we have already  noted,  the  essential requirement of Article 173 read with Form VII-A was that the person taking the oath or making the affirmation would  bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. The words which  precede this portion are merely descriptive of the person and of his nomination as a candidate."" In  view  of the clear statement. made  by  the  learned Attorney  General that Respondent No. 1 is just  a  Minister like other members of the Council of Ministers though he has been described as Deputy Prime Minister but the  description of  him as Deputy Prime Minister does not confer on him  any powers  of the Prime Minister, along with his other  submis- sions, we think the first contention raised by the petition- er  has  no force. So far as the second contention  is  con- http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 cerned, the petitioner himself does not press it. We accordingly reject the writ petition for the  reasons indicated above. No costs. P.S.   S                                            Petition dismissed. 4",K.M.

" O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave is  against the judgment and order  of a  learned Single  Judge of  the High Court of Punjab and  Haryana at  Chandigarh dated 10-10-1977 in Civil Revision No.1097 of 1976 and CM 1996-CII/76. One Roopa  had a  few sons  which  included  Sadda  and Dallu. In  the line  of Sadda, there occasioned an adoption. The adopted person was Puran. That adoption was questionable at the instance of the reversioners existing in the lines of the  other   sons.  The  gripping  parties  in  the  instant litigation not only involves Puran (the adopted son) but the reversione in  the line  of Dallu,  and those  are Birbal, a great grandson  of Dallu,  Aaidan -  a grandson of Dallu and Nathu -  another  great  grandson  of  Dallu.  When  Puran’s adoptive mother  gifted some  ancestral land  to a  stranger then Nathu was in his mother’s womb but the other two namely Birbal and  Aaidan were  existent.  Nathu  after  birth  and coming of age claimed that he had limitation to question the gift by the adoptive mother of Puran as also the adoption of Puran and  thus filed a suit claiming properties of Sadda by reversion arraying  Puran as  the  principal  defendant  and Birbal and Aaidan as interested defendants; besides arraying some  others   including  some  reversiones  as  defendants. Apparently, at a point of time, Nathu-plaintiff got in terms with Puran  and on  settling the  matter with  him  made  an application to  the Trial Court on 25-10-1975 for withdrawal of the suit. On the very same day, allegedly priorly, Birbal and Aaidan  the defendants who shared interests of reversion with Nathu, prayed for being transposed as plaintiffs to the suit. lt  is in  this situation  that the  Trial  Court  was confronted with  the riddle as to which application deserved disposal first,  i.e. the  application for withdrawal of the suit  or   the  application   for  transposition   of  those defendants as  plaintiffs. It,  by a set of reasoning, opted for the  transposition first  and the  withdrawal later  and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 thus kept  the suit  survived but the High Court reversed it in revision  putting the  withdrawal  application  first  in priority,  rendering   the  application   for  transposition redundant, dismissing the suit as withdrawn. It is this view of the High Court which is under challenge. It is undisputed that per se neither Aaidan nor Birbal, the interested  defendants in  the suit,  had any  surviving right to  sue because  the period of limitation qua them had run out.  The extended period of limitation, which Nathu had on account  of his  being in  the womb  of his mother on the date when limitation started, was personal to him and nobody could  under  his  shadow  claim  extension  of  limitation, standing apparently  on opposite  sides. It  would not  have made the  slightest difference  if the  interests  of  these three were treated common because concededly Nathu alone had the extended  right to  sue and not birbal,and Aaidan. Their capacity to  sue had  to be  viewed  separately.  Since  the factum of  Nathu being  the plaintiff  by itself  could  not extend the period of limitation for Birbal and Aaidan, their transposition would  not have  conferred on  them any better capacity or  right. In  such a  situation it  would not have made  the  slightest  difference  as  to  which  application deserved priority  in disposal as both could have been taken up together,  and the  end-result in  any event,  would have been to  hold that  Birbal and Aaidan could not on their own file or  pursue the  suit, even  if transposed as plaintiffs which had  to  be  dismissed  being  beyond  the  period  of limitation. In this  view  of  the  matter,  we  do  not  think  it appropriate to  interfere in  the orders  of the High Court. the appeal  therefore fails  and  is  hereby  dismissed.  No costs.","Nathu-plaintiff got in terms with Puran and on settling the matter with him made an application to the Trial Court on 25-10-1975 for withdrawal of the suit.

The  executing  Court rejected, the  same which was confirmed in C.R.P.No. 1895/93 by the  impugned order  dated September 26, 1993 of the High Court of Madras. Thus this appeal. Having heard  the learned counsel on both sides, we are of the  view that the sale is in excess of the execution. It is not  in dispute  that the  property sold  consists  of  a built-up house  in a  portion measuring  1053  sq.  ft.  The property was originally valued for a sum of Rs.75,000/-. But subsequently, it  was reduced to Rs.50,000/-. At an auction, it was  sold for  a mere sum of Rs.15,100/-. The upset price was Rs.15,000/-. The respondent’s bid was for Rs.15,100/ and the sale  was knocked down as stated earlier, subject to the discharge of  the mortgage  for a  sum of Rs.40,000/-. It is now stated  by Mr.  A.T.M. Sampath,  the learned counsel for the second  respondent that  the  respondent  himself  is  a mortgagee of  that property for a sum of Rs.40,000/-. It is, therefore, clear  that nobody was coming forward to purchase the property and the respondent himself had purchased it for a sum  of Rs.15,100/-.  Under these circumstances, we are of the view  that the sale conducted by the executing Court was obviously illegal.  It is  stated  that  the  appellant  had already deposited  the entire  decretal amount  and  it  was withdrawn  by  the  decree-holder  also.  In  addition,  the appellant is  directed to  deposit interest  @ 18%  from the date of  the sale, namely, January 20, 1992 till date on the amount of  Rs.15,100/- deposited  by the  respondent and the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 respondent shall  be at  liberty to  withdraw the  same.  In addition, the  appellant shall  also pay  a sum of Rs.2000/- towards poundage fee. The amount shall be deposited within a period of six months from today. The appeal  is accordingly allowed subject to the above terms. No costs.","In execution  of money decree in O.S.67/87, the property, i.e.,  1053 sq. feet of  land with built-in house was sold for a sum of Rs.15100/- subject to discharge of the mortgage sum.
