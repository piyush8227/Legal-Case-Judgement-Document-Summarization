1360," CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 1978. (Appeal  by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order  dated 11th  January,  1978 of the Punjab & Haryana High  Court  in Criminal Misc.  No. 129-M of 1978). S.   K. Alehta for the Appellant. M.   M. Punchhi and P. C. Bhartari for the Respondent. ORDER The  offence alleged in this case against the  appellant  is one under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption  Act. Bail was granted by the Sessions Judge after hearing counsel on both sides but it was cancelled by the High Court  mainly for  the reason that the appellant had simultaneously  moved for  bail  in  the Sessions as well as  in  the  High  Court without  disclosing to the Sessions Court that he had  moved for  bail in the High Court.  This naturally made  the  High Court  feel that the party was not straight-forward  in  his dealings, with the Court.  The consequence was that the bail http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 already granted was reversed. Counsel for the State pressed before us that the  corruption of which the appellant was guilty prima-facie (according  to the  results of the investigation) was substantial.  Let  us assume  so.   Even then refusal of bail is not  an  indirect process  of  punishing  an  accused  person  before  he   is convicted.  This is a confusion regarding the rationale,  of bail.  This 128 Court has explained the real basis of bail law in  Gurcharan Singh  & ors. etc. v. State (Delhi Administration) (1).   We do  not  think there is as yet any  allegation  against  the appellant  of  interference with the course  of  justice  or other well-established grounds for refusal of bail.  In this view, we direct that the appellant be allowed to continue on bail  until  further orders to the contrary  passed  by  the Sessions  Court  if  good  grounds  are  made  out  to   its satisfaction. S.R. Appeal allowed. (1) (1978) 2 S.C R. 358. 129","Bail was granted by the Sessions Judge after hearing counsel on both sides.

1361," J U D G M E N T Leave granted.  Heard learned  counsel  for  booth  the parties. Second defendant  is the appellant. Suit for partition, separate  possession   and  profits   instituted  by     the plaintiff_first  respondent    has  been  decreed    by  the appellate Court  with the  following shares  plaintiff 1/12, first defendant  5/12 and  second defendant  6/12. The  High Court has  modified the said shares in the following manner: plaintiff 1/12,  first defendant  7/12 and  second defendant 4/12. Since  fils share  has been reduced by the High Court, the present has been preferred by the second  defendant . One Atmaram,  who died on January 13,1971,had two wives - Janki  Bai and  Rama Bai. Plaintiff Indira Bai and the 4th defendant latya  are the  children by  Janaki  Bai.  Whereas first defendant Krishna and second defendant Baliram are the sons through  Rama Bai. Rama Bai was alive when the suit was instituted and  she was  impleaded as  the third  defendant. Pending the  suit Rama  Bai died and defendants 1 and 2 -her sons -  have been  impleaded as  her legal  representatives. This  was   done  notwithstanding  the  plea  of  the  first defendant  Krishna   that  Rama  Bai  has  executed  a  will bequeathing her  entire interest   in  his favour  aline. In this appeal  we are  not concerned  with the  shares of  the plaintiff and defendants 1 and 2. Here again the plaintiff’s share at  1/12 is  not in  dispute. The  dispute  really  is between  defendants   1  and  2.  The  appellate  court  had determined the  shares  of  defendant  1  and  defendant  2, keeping aside  the will relied upon the first defendant . On the other hand, the High Court has accepted the will as true and accordingly  modified the shared of these two defendants as 7/12 and 4/12 respectively. In our  opinion, the  High Court  was not  justified in modifying the  shares as  aforesaid . Firstly, the will said to have  been executed  by Rama  Bai in  favour of the first http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 defendant was  not in  issue in  the suit  nor in  the  L.R. application and  no finding  with respect  to its  truth and validity has  been recorded.  Notwithstanding the said will, both the  brothers defendants  1 and 2 were impleaded as the L.Rs. of  Rama Bai  . Moreover, since the first defendant is seeking to  alter the  normal rule  of succession by putting forward the said will, the burden lies upon him to establish the truth and validity of the will. For the  above reasons,  we set  aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the judgment and decree of the  first Appellate  Court. It   is, however, made clear that it  shall be  open to  the first defendant to establish the truth  and validity  of the  said will in an appropriate suit/proceeding in  which event, it is obvious, the inter se shares as  between the  present defendants  1  and  2  shall depend the  finding of  competent court  regarding the truth validity of the will. The second  appeal is  accordingly allowed in the above terms. No costs.","Second defendant is the appellant. Suit for partition, separate possession  and profits instituted by plaintiff.

This appeal is directed against an order dated 24th of January, 2007 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in LPA NO.1348 of 2005 by which the writ petition filed by the writ petitioner/appellant was dismissed not on merits but on the ground of delay and latches. 3.      On grant of leave, we have heard the learned counsel for the parties. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after examining the orders of the High Court, viz., the order of the Division Bench impugned in this appeal and the order of the learned Single Judge, we are of the view that the Division Bench as well as the learned single Judge of the High Court were not justified in rejecting the writ petition as well as the writ appeal on the ground of delay and latches as the writ petitioner i.e. the appellant had moved the writ petition before the High Court against the decision of the State Government only in 1996, i.e. after 4 years from the date of passing of such order. The Division Bench as well as the learned Single Judge, in our view, had committed an error in holding that the pendency of the review/representation of the writ petitioner/appellant could not be taken to be a ground for condoning the delay after 4 years of the decision of the State Government. In our view, the High Court had fallen into error in not holding that the appellant had sufficiently explained why the writ petition could not be moved or why it was moved after 4 years of the decision of the State Government. Since the appellant had filed a representation/review of the decision of the State Government, it was expected by him that an order should be passed on the said representation/review. Therefore, in our view, the delay in moving the writ application against the decision of the State Government was sufficiently http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 explained by the appellant and, therefore, the writ petition ought not to have been dismissed on the ground of delay and latches. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned orders of the Division Bench as well as of the learned Single Judge.  The writ petition is, accordingly, restored to its file. The High Court is requested to decide the writ petition on merits in accordance with law after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties and after permitting the parties to exchange their affidavits, if not already exchanged in the meantime. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. There will be no order as to costs.","This appeal is directed against an order dated 24th of January, 2007 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna.

By the said order the High Court has directed the Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Coal, New Delhi, Chairman, Coal India Ltd., Kolkata and Regional Manager, Metal Scrap Trading Corporation Ltd., Kolkata to appear in person before the Court and produce the relevant documents required by the court. The learned Solicitor General appearing for the applicant has submitted that though the copies of the documents required by the court are already on record, still the originals of the same will be made available to the Court as directed by it, hence, personal presence of the officers named herein above may be dispensed with. We think on the facts and circumstances of this case it is reasonable prayer hence, we direct the officers named in the order of the High Court and referred to herein above to direct the production of the required documents through any designated officers or through their counsel appearing in the High Court on 8th of March, 2005. We make this order on an assurance given by the learned Solicitor General. On that basis we stay the direction of the High Court for the personal presence of the above named officers of the time being. The learned Solicitor General then submitted that nearly 3.4 lacs metric tons of coal is lying in stock in open yard with the North Eastern Coalfields, and because of the delay in disposal of the writ petition by the High Court the said stock of coal is getting deoxydised, because of which the quality of coal is deteriorating. He submitted if the claim of the respondents named herein above is to be upheld that Would only require about 8 rakes of coal to satisfy their need hence, North Eastern Coalfields is willing to supply the same at the rates prevailing in the month of December, 2004 to the named respondents herein subject to the condition that they would file an indemnity bond before the High Court undertaking to pay the difference in value in the event of their claim failing before the High Court. He also prays that the balance stock of coal in the North Eastern Coalfields may be permitted to be sold to the highest bidders in ‘E’ - Auction, to prevent the loss to the said Coalfields. We think this is also a reasonable offer, therefore, we direct the respondents named herein above, if they so desire to collect such quantity of coal which they last purchased from Northern Coalfields, to approach the authorities of North Eastern Coalfields land collect the said quantity of coal at the rate mentioned herein above within two weeks from today after furnishing the undertaking. If the said respondent companies fail to lift the coal as permitted to them by this order and on conditions herein, it will be open to North Eastern Coalfields to dispose of the same in accordance with their new policy. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 This interim order is made because of the facts and circumstances of this case.

Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. By order  dated  November  8,  1996  the  petition  was dismissed as  against the  first petitioner,  Bhikari Behera and notice  was ordered  in respect  of  the  remaining  two petitioners, namely,  Pramod Kumar  Mantri, Bhagirathi Rout. The case of the prosecution is that on May 28, 1988 at about 10.00 a.m., all the three accused armed with Thengas entered into the  house of  deceased Bauribandhu. A-1 had hit him on the head  twice and  threw his  down. Thereafter,  the three accused had  dragged the  deceased outside  the house.  When wife and  son of  the deceased  raised alarm,  they ran away from the  place. FIR  was lodged  at about  11.30  A.M.  and thereafter investigation  was conducted.  The appellants and two others  have been  charged under  Section 302  read with under Section  149 I.P.C.  The Courts  below  convicted  the appellants for  an offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section  34  I.P.C.  As  regards  the  assault  by  the appellants, there is no corroborating evidence by the doctor as to  dragging of  the deceased  by the  accused. Even  the evidence of  the eye-witnesses  is  discrepant  on  material particulars. Accused Nos. 2 and 3 were standing behind PW-2. If really  all the  three accused had entered into the house all of  them would  have attacked  the deceased. That is not the case  of the prosecution. Under these circumstances, the prosecution cannot  be said to have proved beyond reasonable doubt that  the appellants  shared the common intention with A-1 to  kill the  deceased. Even  the evidence  of PW-1 that they entered  the house  and dragged  the  deceased  is  not reliable since  the admission  in the  cross-examination  is http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that there  was no  blood stain  outside the  house. Had the dragging really been there, there would be trail of blood. The appeals are accordingly allowed.

This appeal is filed by way of a special leave petition against the final judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad dated 25th of October, 2007 in Second Appeal No. 539 of 2006 whereby a learned Judge of the High Court had dismissed the second appeal filed by the appellant and affirmed the orders of the courts below. 4.      A suit for eviction of the appellant from the suit premises was instituted by the plaintiff/respondent which was decreed by the trial court and the decision of the trial court was affirmed by the first appellate court and finally, the second appeal of the appellant was dismissed. Before the High court in the second appeal, the only question that was raised was whether in the present case, notice under Section  106 of the Transfer of Property Act should be restricted to 6 months or 1 month. All the three courts below held that tenancy was from month to month and accordingly, the second appeal was dismissed and the orders of the courts below were affirmed. This special leave petition has now been filed against the aforesaid judgment in second appeal affirming the judgments of the courts below in respect of which leave has already been granted. 5.      Mr. A. Subba Rao, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant restricted his arguments to the order passed by the learned single Judge, which is as follows: - ""Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant is granted time up to the end of May 2008, on condition that he furnishes an undertaking before the trial court, within four weeks from today, to the effect that he will put the respondent herein in vacant possession and continues to pay the rents regularly. In default, apart from being liable to be evicted, the appellant shall be liable to pay the damages at the rate of Rs. 10,000/- per month beyond 31.05.2008."" 6.       According to Mr. Rao, the High Court was in error to direct the appellant to pay damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month if the appellant continues to remain in possession of the suit premises after 31st of May, 2008 which was granted by the High Court in the impugned judgment. Mr. Nikilesh Ramachandran, learned counsel http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appearing for the respondent, conceded that this direction of the High Court was in fact not justified.  Considering the fact that proceedings for mesne profit under Order 20 Rule 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be proceeded with in accordance with law and in view of the concession of learned counsel for the respondent, direction to pay damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month, if the appellant continues to remain in possession after 31st of May, 2008 must be set aside. Therefore, we set aside the portion to the effect that the appellant shall be liable to pay damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month if he continues to remain in possession of the suit premises after 31st of May, 2008. 7.      For the reasons aforesaid the appeal is disposed of by deleting the portion as quoted hereinabove.  However, the appellant is granted nine months time from today to vacate the suit premises on payment of Rs.2,000/- per month subject to filing of usual undertaking in this Court within a period of four weeks from this date.","This appeal is filed by way of a special leave petition against the final judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad dated 25th of October, 2007 in Second Appeal No. 539 of 2006.

1367," J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 6902 of 2005) Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Jharkhand High Court.  The plaintiff, who had filed the second appeal before the High Court under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the ’Code’), has filed this appeal. Detailed reference to the factual aspect is really unnecessary. Plaintiff had filed the suit for declaration of title as well as confirmation of possession over the suit land.  The description of the property was given as plot No. 51 measuring 36 decimal of land appertaining to Khata No. 80 of Village Japla, Dhorhara, District Palamu.  The suit was dismissed by the learned Munsif Daltonganj. An appeal was carried before the first appellate court.  In the appeal, learned VIII Additional District Judge, Palamau held that the appellant’s claim was to be accepted in respect of 22 decimal of land and that the defendants had got possession over 14 decimals of land.  Appellant filed appeal under Section 100 of the Code questioning correctness of the view expressed by the first appellate court. The following question was formulated in the second appeal treating the same to be a substantial question of law. ""Whether the Court of appeal below erred in law in rejecting plaintiff’s claim over 14 decimals out of total 36 decimals land of plot No. 51, when Raiyati Settlement obtaining in 1342 Fasli was not negatived."" It is to be noted that the defendants had not questioned correctness of the judgment and decree of the first appellate Court.  Hereafter starts the confusion. Though the defendants had not questioned correctness of the view expressed by the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 first appellate court and even had not tried to support the conclusions during hearing of the second appeal filed by the appellant, yet the High Court set aside the order of the first appellant court and consequentially confirmed the judgment of the trial court.  As if that was not enough, in the ultimate conclusion the High Court noted that the appeal filed by the appellant was allowed.  In fact the relief that was granted to the appellant by the first appellate court was reversed. In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the course adopted by the High Court is clearly contrary to law.  Admittedly there was no appeal questioning the first appellate court’s view regarding appellant’s entitlement to 22 decimals of land.  In the absence of an appeal by the defendants it was not open to the High Court to take a contrary view. Learned counsel for the respondents fairly conceded that there was no appeal filed by them so far as the relief granted by the first appellant court i.e. 22 decimals of land.  It was also fairly conceded that there was no stand taken by them before the High Court to the effect that the relief granted to the appellant was not legal. As noted above there are confusions galore in the High Court’s order; firstly the appeal was dismissed but the first appellate court’s order which was in favour of the appellant was set aside without any challenge from the defendants ; secondly in the appellant’s appeal the relief which was not questioned by anybody could not have been nullified; thirdly, the High Court’s ultimate conclusion was that the appeal was allowed while it was otherwise. Above being the position we allow the appeal to the extent that the relief granted to the appellant by the first appellate court stands confirmed.  The High Court’s order, directing that the appellate court’s judgment is to be reversed and that of the trial court is to be restored, cannot stand to that extent.

1369," Order This appeal stands referred to a Bench of three Judges because  it was found that a Bench of two learned Judges had taken  the  view that the conclusion of an earlier Bench  of three  learned  Judges was difficult to accept.   The  issue relates  to whether Explanation (2) to Section 40(b) of  the Income Tax Act, 1961, introduced with effect from 1st April, 1985, is prospective in operation or only declaratory. In  Brij  Mohan  Das Laxman Das vs.   Commissioner  of Income  Tax  (223 I.T.R./825) two learned  judges  concluded that  the  said Explanation was declaratory.  This view  was accepted  by  a  Bench of three learned  judges  in  Suwalal Anandilal  Jain vs.  Commissioner of Income Tax (224  I.T.R. 753). In  the case of Rashik Lal & Co.  vs.  Commissioner of Income  Tax (229 I.T.R.458) this view was doubted.  A  Bench of  two  learned  Judges observed that it was  difficult  to accept  the  proposition that the said Explanation was  only clarificatory  for the reason that if what was contained  in the  said  Explanation  was already the law in  force,  then giving  effect to the said Explanation from 1st April,  1985 did  not  make any sense.  But the Bench immediately  noted, ""Hkowever,  in the case before us, no question of payment of any  interest in involved"".  In other words, the application of  Section 40(b) and the said Explanation was not really in issue  in Rashik Lal’s case relative to the said Explanation must, therefore, betreated as obiter dicta.

During the unfortunate strike of the doctors as trade unionists, unmindful of the ethical and medical code of conduct, he was appointed and even continued in the  service till  August, 1987  When his  services  were terminated, he  had gone  to the  Tribunal and  filed OA No. 701/89. The  Tribunal in the impugned order dated 21.12.1994 directed the  appellants to  regularise the  service of  the respondent  in   consultation  with   the   Public   Service Commision. Thus, this appeal by special leave. The controversy  is no  longer longer  res integra.  In similar circumstances,  this Court had considered the entire controversy in J & K Public Service Commission & Ors. vs Dr. Narinder Mohan  & Ors.  [ (1994) 2 SCC 630]. Abmittedly, the post of  doctors in the Central Government Health Scheme are required to be filled up by recruitment through Union Public Service Commission. Therefore, the direction to consider the case of  the respondent  in  consultation  with  the  Public Service Commission for regularisation is in violation of the statutory rules  and Article  320  of  the  Constitution  of India. The  only course  Known to  law is  that the Union of India shall  be required  to notify  the recruitment  to the Public  Service   Commission  and   Union   Public   Service commission  shall   conduct  the  examination  inviting  the applications from  all the  eligible persons  including  the persons like the respondents, It would be for the respondent to apply  for and  seek selection  in accordance with Rules. Therefore, the  direction is  in  violation  of  Article  of Article 320 of  the Constitution. The learned  counsel for  the respondent seeks to place reliance on  the directions issued by this Court in Jacob M. Puthuparambil vs.  Kerala Water  Authority [(1987) Supp, SCC 497]. It  is seen  that the  Public Service  Commission  was required to  recruit  the  candidates  and,  therefore,  the additional  Medical   Officers  wording   in   the   Railway Department  in   the  latter   case  were   directed  to  be regularised in  consultation with  the Union  Public Service http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Commission, It  would be  seen that when the recruitment was to be  made in  accordance with  the procedure prescribed by the Public  Service Commission  in terms  of  the  statutory Rules  made   under  Article   320  of   the   Constitution, necessarily the  recruitment is  required to be made in that manner and in no other manner. Therefore, this Court did not intend to  by-pass the  above procedure in regularisation of their  services.   This  Court,  in  similar  circumstances, considered the same question in Union of India & Ors, vs. Dr Arun Kumar Sharma [CA No, 4876/94]. In that  view, the  appeal is allowed.

During the unfortunate strike of the doctors as trade unionists, unmindful of the ethical and medical code of conduct, he was appointed and even continued in the service till August, 1987.

No.308  of 1994  on March 21, 1995. Though the Tribunal has dismissed  the O.A.  on the  ground of  delay,  we  have examined the  matter on  merits. It  is now  clear from  the record placed  by  the  respondents  that  as  a  result  of selection,  list   was  prepared   on  April   4,  1990  for appointment as  Goods Clerks  and Coaching Clerks from among the class  IV employees in the order of merit from the quota reserved for  class IV employees. Out of them they also made reservation to  the members  of the  Scheduled  Castes.  The appellant belongs  to the  Scheduled Castes.  Candidates  at item Nos.17  and 32 of the list also belong to the Scheduled Castes and  were superior  in the  order of merit; they were selected on  the general  standard to  the roster  point  as against those  who were  selected in the reserved quota with relaxed standards.  The appellant  stands at  No.2 while one Sarvan Kumar  stands at No. 1 of the list of reserved quota. It is  true that  in the communication sent to the appellant it was  mentioned that he was selected on general standards. It would appear that subsequently, they realized the mistake and corrected  the same and put him in the order of merit as a candidate  for the  reserved quota.  Since  there  was  no vacancy  existing  for  reserved  quota,  he  could  not  be appointed. Under  those circumstances  we  cannot  give  any direction for  making his  appointment. Since  the list  has already expired by efflux of time, the directions sought for appointment in  the future  vacancies cannot  be given.  But this order  does not  preclude him  from  consideration  for future promotions  in any  of the vacancies that would arise subsequent to the earlier selection. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

1372," O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard  learned  counsel  on  both  sides,  The respondent was  charged for  being absent  from duty  in the Emergency of attending on the flood victims between July 18, 1975 and  July 21,  1975. He  was further  charged for other derelictions of duty. The details are not necessary. Suffice it to  state that  enquiry was  conducted  and  the  Enquiry Officer  submitted  his  report  that  respondent  No.1  had admitted that  he was  having a  private  practice  at  Moga during  the  period  of  his  suspension  in  spite  of  the directions issued  by the Government in the suspension order to remain  at Head-quarter.  Accordingly,  the  disciplinary authority  removed   him  from  service  which  came  to  be challenged in  the High  Court.  The  learned  single  Judge allowed the  writ petition  and directed  reinstatement with consequential  benefits   On  appeal   the  Division   Bench confirmed the  same in the impugned order dated November 17, 1993 in  L.P.A. No.398/92.  Thus,  this  appeal  by  special leave . It is  seen that  the Enquiry Officer’s report is based on the  alleged  admission  made  by  the  respondent.  But, unfortunately,  the   Enquiry  Officer  has  not  taken  his admission in  writing .  Subsequently,  the  respondent  has denied having  made any admission . As against the denial of the delinquent,  we have  only the  statement of the Enquiry Officer which  is not  supported by any statement in writing taken from  the respondent.  Under those circumstances, High Court may  be  justified  in  setting  aside  the  order  of dismissal. It  is now well settled law that when the enquiry was found  to be  faulty, it  could not  be proper to direct reinstatement with  consequential benefits.  Matter requires to be  remitted to  the disciplinary authority to follow the procedure from  the stage at which the fault was pointed out and to  take action  according to  law. Pending  enquiry the delinquent must  be  deemed  to  be  under  suspension.  The http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 consequential benefits  would depend  upon the result of the enquiry  and  order  passed  thereon.  The  High  Court  had committed illegality in omitting to give the said direction. Since the respondent had retired from service, now no useful purpose will  be served  in  directing  to  conduct  enquiry afresh. However,  the respondent is not entitled to the back wages as  he voided  responsibility as  a Doctor to treat on flood victims and that was cause for the suspension The  appeal   is   accordingly   allowed.   No   costs. Disallowance of the back wages would not stand in the way of computation  of   the  pensionary  benefits  as  if  he  had continued in service.","The respondent was charged for being absent from duty in the Emergency of attending on the flood victims between July 18, 1975 and July 21, 1975.

The grievance of the appellants is that a sum of Rs.46,221/- had wrongly been paid to the respondent as he was put on a wrong scale of pay. It is that amount which is now sought to be recovered. 3.      The respondent herein filed a writ petition questioning the said action on the part of the appellants herein. The said amount was sought to be recovered by way of an adjustment from the amount of gratuity payable to the respondent. 4.      The appellants did not file any counter affidavit before the High Court. The High Court by reason of the impugned judgment not only directed the appellants to return the said sum of Rs. 46,221/- to the respondent forthwith, but also imposed a costs of Rs. 25,000/- as compensation for illegally encroaching upon his right to gratuity. The appellants are, thus, before us. 5.      There cannot be any doubt, whatsoever, that all administrative bodies are entitled t o rectify their mistake and for the said purpose, if an administrative order is required to be passed, they are not denuded therefrom. 6.      The respondent herein, however, has retired from service in 1997.  He was otherwise entitled to the amount of gratuity.  The amount of gratuity should not, ordinarily, have been withheld. We, therefore, are of the opinion that interest of justice would be subserved if we exercise our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and direct the appellants to comply with the High Court’s order and at the same time set aside that portion of the High Court’s order whereby the appellants herein have been asked to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the respondent, as compensation for illegally encroaching upon his right to gratuity.

1374," J U D G M E N T Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J: Heard learned counsel for the appellants. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellants. Challenge in the writ appeal was to the order passed by a learned Single Judge in O.P. No.4287 of 2000. The High Court relied on some earlier decisions to hold that a person resigning under Rule 19 of the Border Security Force Rules, 1969 (in short ‘the Rules’) is entitled to pension if he is eligible.  The writ appeal was dismissed and the appellants were directed to dispose of the representation of the respondent  in  the  light  of the judgment referred to i.e. Jos. Vs. Border Security Force (1999 (3) KLT 904). Relying upon this judgment, the learned Single Judge had directed the respondents in the writ petition to consider the representation of the appellant within a stipulated time. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the respondent was not eligible for pension as she had completed only 18 years and three months of service.  Strong reliance is placed on a decision of this Court in Civil Appeal No.6166 of 1999 and connected cases, disposed of on 30.03.2001. This Court, inter-alia, observed as follows:- \023In the result, there is no substance in the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that on the basis of Rule 49 of the CCS (Pension) Rules or on the basis of G.O., the respondents who have retired after completing qualifying service of 10 years but before completing qualifying service of 20 years by voluntary retirement, are entitled to get pensionary benefits.  Respondents who were permitted to resign from service under Rule 19 of the BSF Rules before the attainment of the age of retirement or before putting such number of years of service, as may be necessary under  the  Rules,  to be   eligible  for retirement are not entitled to get any pension under any of the provisions  under CCS(Pension) Rules.  Rule 49 only prescribes the procedure for calculation and quantification of pension amount.  The G.O. dated 27.12.1995 does not confer additional right of pension on the BSF employee.\024 (Underlined for emphasis) There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent inspite of service of notice. In view of what has been stated by this Court, it is for the appellants to consider the question of eligibility.  Neither the learned Single Judge nor the Division Bench decided about the eligibility.  The only direction given was to consider the representation. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 It was open to the appellants to reject the representation by deciding the issue of eligibility.  If the respondent has any grievance to such rejection, she can take appropriate remedy as available in law.  We, therefore, dispose of the appeal  holding  that  the  representation be disposed of, if pending within three months after deciding  the  question  of eligibility.  Needless  to   say  if  the respondent has any grievance, she can agitate it before an appropriate forum. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.","Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellants.

1377," J  U  D G  M  E  N  T RAJENDRA BABU,  J.  : On the allegation that the respondents committed the murder of Nadia Venkat Reddi,  the trial court on examination of 19 witnesses held that the prosecution case was not established and thus acquitted the accused.  The State filed an appeal to the High Court which refused to grant leave to file appeal and dismissed it principally on the basis that there was no trace of the chilly power alleged to have been used for the commission of the offence either on the dead body or near the scene of the occurrence of the incident. The evidence of PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 is clearly to the effect that the accused had caused the death of Nadia Venkat Reddi.  It is no doubt true that the trial court adverted to discrepancies in their evidence and found that (1) the medical evidence given in the case is inconsistent with their testimony while PW 1 to PW4 stated that the accused threw chilly power on the face of the deceased, the Doctor who conducted the post mortem examination stated that he did not find chilly powder on the body of the deceased at the time of post mortem; nor such chilly powder could be found at the place of the incident; (2) that, PW-3 did not inform any body at Choutaparthy about the incident; (3) that, PW-3 stated that he did not raise any cries but PW-9 stated that he heard certain cries in explanation of the cause for his reaching the spot of incident.   Whether these aspects are appropriately explained in the evidence or are of such weight as to overwhelm other evidence when it did point out definitely that on 28.12.1984 deceased Nadia Venkat Reddi came to Choutparthy village; that while the deceased and his brother-in-law Padmanabha Reddi were proceeding to go to Warangal on 28.12.1984 and as they came out of the door, the accused exhorted them and killed the deceased; that the reason of the death of the deceased is the land dispute between A-1 and the deceased.  This is not one of those cases in which the High Court should have refused to grant leave to appeal.  In this background, we are not satisfied with the manner of disposal of the matter by the High Court.  However, it is made clear that we shall not be understood to have expressed any view on the merits and the worth of evidence. In the result, we set aside the order made by the High Court and restore the appeal. The matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law.

1378," J U D G M E N T ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissing the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the appellant summarily. Writ petition was filed by the Respondent alleging that his pre-existing enlistment was not revalidated on erroneous premises. The writ petition was allowed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court.  The Letters Patent Appeal questioning correctness of learned Single Judge’s order was dismissed. Respondent’s application for revalidation of enlistment was refused on the ground that he did not fulfill the requisite criteria. It was indicated that on evaluation of his performance he fell short of the required marks and, therefore, his request for revalidation was not acceptable.  Before the High Court the stand of the respondent was that the methodology adopted in assessing his performance was erroneous. It was denied of legitimate marks. Primarily on two grounds the marks were denied to the respondent. The present appellants in the counter affidavit filed stated that the evaluation was done correctly. Learned Single Judge noticed that there were two factors for which the marks were not allotted. Firstly, it related to delay in completion of work and secondly about the quality of work. He found that some of the authorities had accepted that the delay in completion of work was not attributable to the respondent and similarly certificates have been issued about the quality of work. Accordingly, direction was given to revalidate the respondent’s registration as a Class II (B&R) contractor for a period of five years from the date of expiry of the respondent’s earlier enlistment. In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the summary disposal of the Letters Patent Appeal is erroneous.  Though it was specifically brought to the notice of the High Court that in a similar case, the concerned writ petitioner was denied relief. Letters Patent Appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench even without noticing the said judgment. In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the learned Single Judge has analysed the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 factual position elaborately and, therefore, the Division Bench was justified in summarily dismissing the Letters Patent Appeal. We find that a Division Bench of the High Court in Amrit Lal v. Union of India and Ors. (CWP No. 6463 of 2001) by judgment dated 1.8.2002 had expressed views which prima facie appeared to be at variance with the view expressed by learned Single Judge.  This judgment appears to have been placed before the Division Bench in the Letters Patent Appeal for consideration; but Letters Patent Appeal was summarily dismissed.  The manner of disposal is clearly inappropriate.  It was open to the Division Bench to examine whether it was in agreement with the view expressed in the earlier writ petition where some identical issues were considered. But that has not been done.  The two factors which went into the evaluation process were delay in completion of the work and quality of work. Both these aspects normally are not to be adjudicated in writ petitions because factual adjudication is necessary. This aspect has also not been considered by the Division Bench in the impugned order. It has been brought to our notice that during the pendency of the appeal this Court had permitted a fresh evaluation of the respondent’s application for revalidation.  It is pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant that on revaluation also the respondent was not found eligible. We do not think it necessary to deal with that aspect presently. It would be appropriate for the Division Bench of the High Court to hear the LPA No.684 of 2002 afresh and to dispose it of by a reasoned order. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on merits. Appeal is accordingly disposed of without any orders as to costs. 27998",The writ petition was filed by the Respondent alleging that his pre-existing enlistment was not revalidated on erroneous premises.

Mr. Nikilesh Ramachandran, learned counsel http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appearing for the respondent, conceded that this direction of the High Court was in fact not justified.  Considering the fact that proceedings for mesne profit under Order 20 Rule 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be proceeded with in accordance with law and in view of the concession of learned counsel for the respondent, direction to pay damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month, if the appellant continues to remain in possession after 31st of May, 2008 must be set aside. Therefore, we set aside the portion to the effect that the appellant shall be liable to pay damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month if he continues to remain in possession of the suit premises after 31st of May, 2008. 7.      For the reasons aforesaid the appeal is disposed of by deleting the portion as quoted hereinabove.

The Division Bench was also of the view that whether  the foreign judgment is conclusive or not is to be decided in the light of the provision contained in Section 13 C.P.C. but that can be done so only at the conclusion of the trial and not at the threshold because a perusal of the plaint and documents filed along with the plaint do not lead to such a conclusion. In the premises aforesaid the Division Bench held that the order passed by the learned Single Judge was not tenable in law  and accordingly the same was set aside by the aforesaid order.  The Division Bench, therefore, remanded the suit to the learned Single Judge to be decided on merit after the conclusion of the trial. We are of the view that the view taken by the Division Bench requires no interferenc e. We clarify that all the contentions are open to the defendant in the suit including the applicability of Section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.

Civil Appeal No. 2757/06: This civil appeal is filed by the assessee against order dated 24.1.2006 in appeal No. C/276/04 delivered by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (""CESTAT""). 2.      This matter is a sequel to the decision just delivered in the case of Commissioner of Customs  v.  M/s Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd. (Civil Appeal No. 8426/02). Appellant is the manufacturer of Printers. The integral part of a printer is what is called as a shuttle. In the present case, we are concerned with Technical Assistance Agreement (""TAA""). Appellant imports shuttles which are used in the manufacture  of printers. Unlike M/s Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd. case (supra) there is no related party transaction in the present case. In the present case, the parties are at arm’s length. The adjudicating authority has accepted the transaction value. 3.      The only question which arises for determination in this civil appeal is whether the adjudicating authority was entitled to load the royalty/licence fee payment on to the price of the imported goods, viz, the shuttle(s) by taking its peak price. In the present case, the importer/buyer used to negotiate with the foreign supplier on quarterly basis. During the period under consideration, the importer received an order for bulk supply. Therefore, there was lowering of price. This factor was not at all considered by the adjudicating authority under rule 9(1)(c). In fact, during the enquiry before the adjudicating authority, the appellant-importer placed correspondence between it and the foreign supplier which indicated that the appellant had received a bulk order for printers and, therefore, it had to lower its price which fact had not at all been considered by the adjudicating authority while invoking rule 9(1)(c). In the present case, there is nothing to indicate that royalty payment was a condition pre-requisite to the sale of shuttle. The only ground on which the adjudicating authority has held against the appellant herein is that the shuttle is an integral part of the printer. This view has been accepted also by the Tribunal, erroneously. The Tribunal also failed to consider that the appellant had received a bulk order for which it gave a price discount. The correspondence between the foreign seller and the importer was placed before the adjudicating authority before conclusion of the enquiry. There was no reason to reject the said correspondence, particularly when it was placed before the arguments stood concluded. Moreover, in the present case, the royalty payment was not based on value. The royalty was payable at the rate of $ 50/70 per piece. In view of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the law laid down by us in M/s Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the appellant succeeds. 4.      For the aforestated reasons, and particularly in the light of the law discussed in the earlier judgment in the case of M/s Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), we set aside the impugned judgment of the Tribunal as erroneous. 5.      Accordingly, Civil Appeal No. 2757/06 filed by the assessee is allowed with no order as to costs. Civil Appeal No. 4519/06: 6.      This appeal is filed by the assessee-importer against order dated 26.4.2006 by the CEGAT in Application for rectification of mistake in Appeal No. C/276/04 (Final Order No. 103/06).

To bring home  his contention  he has drawn on attention to the F.I.R. that was recorded on the complaint of a Sub Inspector of Police  for offences  punishable under  Sections 332, 307 and 427  IPC, 7  of  the  Criminal  Law  Amendment  Act  and Sections 3 and 4 of TADA. After having  given our  anxious consideration  to  the above contention  of Mr.  Ramaswamy we  are unable to accept the same.  it is  of course  true that when the above F.I.R. was recorded not only for of fences under  TADA but also for offences under the Indian Penal Code for commission of which the concerned  police officer  was  competent  to  lodge  an F.I.R. without  such approval.  The absence  of approval  of District Superintendent  of Police as required under Section 20 A  (1)  of  TADA  at  that  stage  only  disentitled  the investigating  agency   to  investigate  into  the  offences relating to TADA but it had a statutory right to investigate into the  other offences alleged in the F.I.R. If the F.I.R. was lodged  only for  commission of  offences under  TADA we might have  persuaded ourselves  to accept the contention of Mr. Ramaswamy,  but there being allegation of other offences therein it  cannot be  said that  the F.I.R.  so far  as  it sought investigation of  these offences was non-est. There are  certain other  facts which  required  to  be noticed at  this stage.  After the  F.I.R  was  lodged,  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 investigating agency made a prayer before the Superintendent of Police,  Ghaziabad  on  November  21,  1994  seeking  his approval to  and Sections 3 and 4 of TADA on the ground that during investigation  the involvement  of the  appellant  in commission of  such  offences  was  revealed.  The  approval sought for  was granted  and  thereafter  on  completion  of investigation chargesheet was submitted with the sanction of the concerned  authority as  required under  Section of  the concerned authority  as required  under Section  20 A (2) of TADA. Since  the above  steps  taken  by  the  Investigating Agency are  in conformity  with the  provisions of both sub- sections (1)  & (2)  of Section  20 a  of TADA  the impugned charges are not liable to be quashed on the grounds agitated by Mr. Ramaswamy.

It is further alleged that the petitioner’s company sold some of its products to the respondent in connection with which the respondent issued a cheque dated 5.12.2002 in favour of the petitioner.  That cheque was presented by the petitioner to its bank being Punjab National Bank, Connaught Place, New Delhi, but the same was dishonoured.  Hence, a criminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi, which is pending before the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. 4.

1390," THE 12TH DAY OF AUGUST,1996 Present: Hon’ble Mr.Justice K.Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr.Justice G.B.Pattanaik U.U.Lalit, Adv. for the appellant S.V.Leshpande, Adv. for the Respondents O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: Parwatabai V. Sonabai & Ors. O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The admitted  facts  are  that  the  lands  in  dispute belonged to  Punjab and  on his demise, his widow Parwatabai had succeeded  to his  estate  in  1941.  Consequently,  she became the  owner of a limited estate. It is the appellant’s case that  Parwatabai had executed a registered gift deed in favour of  her husband  in 1941  and eversince  they are  in possession and  enjoyment  of  the  lands.  Admittedly,  the respondents are  daughter of  Parwatabai. It  is their  case that on  the demise  of their mother, they became the owners of the  property and were in possession of the property till 1976 when  they were  dispossessed and  as a consequence the suit was  filed for possession based on title. Though it was specifically  not  pleaded  on  title,  admittedly  on  fact situation suit was filed under Article 65 of the Schedule to the Limitation  Act, 1963  [for short, the ""Act""]. The trial Court negatived  the respondents’  claim and  dismissed  the suit. On  appeal, the  trial Court  decreed the suit holding 3that the  respondents had  on the demise of their mother in 1966 succeeded  to the  estate of  their father.  Therefore. they are entitled to the possession since the suit was filed within 10  years under  Article 65  of the  Act. Thus,  this appeal by special leave. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Shri U.R.  Lalit, learned  counsel for  the  appellant, contended that  since the  husband of the appellant remained in  possession,  pursuant  to  the  gift  deed  executed  by Parwatabai, by  operation of  explanation (b) to Article 65, burden is  on the  respondents to  establish as  to when the possession of  the appellant  became adverse and they failed to discharge  the same.  Therefore, the  appropriate article applicable to  the facts would be Article 64 and not Article 65. We  find no  force in  the contention. Admittedly, after the demise  of  Panjuba,  Parwatabai  succeeded  as  widow’s estate prior  to 1941 and that, therefore, she was only life estate holder  to enjoy  the estate for her life time. Under the gift deed, what she could bequeath was enjoyment of life estate and  not right  and title of the property of Punjuba. Consequently, on  her demise,  the appellants being heirs of Punjab are entitled to assert their right to the property of their father on the basis of their title. Article 65 of the Act postulates that for possession of immovable property  or any  interest therein based on title, when the  possession of the defendant becomes adverse to the plaintiff, the  suit  has  to  be  filed  within  12  years. Therefore, when  the plaintiffs  asserted their title on the basis of succession to the estate of their father, it is for the appellant  to prove  as to on which date the appellant’s possession has  become adverse to the respondents’ title. In this case, the appellate Court and the High Court found that the appellant  had not  established as to what was the exact date from  which the  adverse  possession  started  running. Since Parwatabai died in 1966, admittedly, the plaintiff had filed  the  suit  in  1966  within  10  years.  Under  those circumstances, the  appellant had not perfected the title by prescription. The  courts below have rightly applied Article 65 and  decreed the suit. It is not vitiated by any error of law warranting interference. The  appeal   is  accordingly  dismissed,  but  in  the circumstances, without costs.","The lands in dispute belonged to Punjab and on his demise, his widow Parwatabai had succeeded  to his estate in 1941.

On  that  basis,  the  High  Court confirmed the  market value at Rs.8,400/- per acre in Appeal Nos.869 and  871 of  1985. In  view of  the  fact  that  the Corporation itself  had taken  a policy decision to withdraw the appeals  where the  value of  the land was determined at the rate  of Rs.8,000/-  per acre  and less,  and since  the lands are  situated  in  the  hamlet  of  the  main  village Naidpalli which  are contiguous blocks, the determination of the compensation  in respect of these lands also would be at the rate of Rs.8,000/- per acre.

The common reasoned award passed by the learned Arbitrator on 23rd of May, 1996 under the Arbitration Act, 1940 (in short ’the Act’) and made a rule of the court by the Civil Court on 20th of December, 1997 was set aside in its entirety by the High Court only on the ground that the  arbitrator had erroneously decided the issue whether the claims preferred by the appellant were barred by limitation.   It is on record that the entire matter was remitted by the High Court, despite the lapse of over 10 years since the reference was made, to a different arbitrator for a fresh decision on merits. 3.      In our view, the judgment of the High Court is not sustainable in law and the objections filed by the respondent-State against the award ought to have been entertained by the Civil Court despite there being a considerable delay in filing the same and in spite of the fact that there was, in the first instance, no application for condonation of delay. For this purpose, we have looked into the explanations given in the application for condonation of delay in filing the objection under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. We are of the view that the explanations offered do constitute sufficient cause in filing the objection under Section 33 of the Act. In this view of the matter, we set aside the judgment of the High Court as well as of the trial court and the matter may be remitted back to the trial court for decision on the objection filed under Section 33 of the Act. The objection under section 33 of the Act shall be decided by the trial Court positively within six months from the date of supply of a copy of this order to it after giving hearing to the parties and after passing a reasoned order in accordance with law. 4.      For the reasons aforesaid, the appeals are allowed to the extent indicated above. There will be no order as to costs.","These appeals are directed against the common final judgment and order dated 12th of September, 2003 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in M.F.A.

1395," O R D E R Having seen  the details of the facts and circumstances in these appeals we do not think that there is any substance for interference. A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act was published acquiring 25 acres and odd for public purpose, namely,  for   establishment  of   grain  market.  The  Land Acquisition Collector  in his  award dated February 18, 1972 awarded compensation at varying rates between Rs.40,000/- to Rs.10,000/- per  acre. On reference, the Additional District Judge, in  his award  and decree dated May 3, 1976, enhanced compensation varying between Rs.90,000/- and Rs.30,000/- per acre. On  appeal, the  High Court  awarded on  flat rate  of Rs.70,220/- per  acre. Being  dissatisfied  with  it,  these appeals have been filed. We  have   seen  the   judgment  of   the  High  Court. Practically, for  large extent  of land  enhancement made by the Additional  District Judge was reduced from Rs.90,000/-, Rs.85,000/-,  Rs.80,000/-   and  Rs.75,000/-   per  acre  to Rs.70,220/- per  acre. The only question is of the lands for which Rs.65,000/-  and Rs.35,000/-  were awarded, which were enhanced to  Rs.70,220/-. As  to  the  first  part,  namely, compensation of  Rs.65,000/- per  acre which was enhanced to Rs.70,000/-, there is not much of difference. Though we find there is  substantial difference  for the  second  category, there is  no material  on record  showing  detail  of  lands covered by  this part  of the order. So, it is difficult for this Court  to decide  whethr interference with this part of the order of the High Court is called for. Under these  circumstances, the  appeals are  dismissed but without costs..1s1","A notification under s.4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act was published acquiring 25 acres and odd for public purpose.

1396," O R D E R Leave granted. This is  an appeal  against the order dated January 11, 1989 passed  by the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Revision No. 31  of 1989. In Sessions Case No.63A of 1981 on the file of the  Additional Sessions  Judge, 11 persons including the appellants are facing trial. The appellants herein were charged for various offences including the  offence of  murder punishable  under  Section 302, Indian  Penal Code.  Now it transpires that on the date of the commission of the offence these appellants were under the age  of 17  and 18 years. Since they were children under the provisions  of the  West Bengal  Children Act, 1959 [for short, ""the  Act""], they  were required  to be  tried by the Juveniles Court  but no  such court  had  been  constituted. Subsequently, pending  proceedings  Juvenile  Justices  Act, 1986 has  come into  force and  the Act stood repealed. Even under the  Act, trial  of the juvenile offenders requires to be conducted by the Juveniles Court. Since no court has been constituted  even   under  the  Central  Act  the  necessary consequences would be that the Sessions Judge had to conduct the trial. Contention was  raised in  the courts  below  that  the Additional Sessions  Judge is not a Sessions Judge and that, therefore,  he   could  not  proceed  with  the  trial.  The contention was  rejected and  thus this  appeal  by  special leave against  the impugned  order dated  January 11,  1989. Section 9  [1] of  the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [Act 21 of  1974] [for  short,  ""the  Code""]  enjoins  the  State Governments to  establish  a  Court  of  Session  for  every sessions division.  It is  made clear  by sub-section [3] of Section 9 which provides that Additional Sessions Judges may be appointed by the High Court to exercise jurisdiction in a Court of  Session. Singular  includes plural. Sessions Judge http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 would include  Additional Sessions  Judge  under  the  Code. Therefore, he gets all the power and the jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge  to try  the offences  enumerated  under  the Code. The Additional Sessions Judge, therefore, is competent to proceed  with the  trial of  the juvenile offenders. Even though at  the relevant  time the appellants were juveniles, by passage  of time  they no  longer remained to be juvenile offenders. They are now in mid thirties. The object of the Juvenile Justice Act is to reform and rehabilitate the  juvenile offenders  as useful  citizens in the society. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the benefit of  the Central  Act was denied to them due to their own  act   of  keeping  the  trial  pending  by  protracting litigation kept  the case pending trial and in the meanwhile the appellants had crossed the age of the juvenile offenders and became  adults. We  do not think it is a proper case for our interference  as no  useful purpose  under  Central  Act would serve. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.","11 persons including the appellants are facing trial. The appellants herein were charged for various offences including the offence of murder.

1397," W I T H CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 8087 OF 1995 (Arising out SLP (C) Nos.3171 of 1990) O R D E R Leave granted. The respondents  have been  appointed on daily wages as T. Mates  with the  appellant. It  is their  grievance  that though they  were holding  the  posts  of  clerks  and  were performing the  duties of the post in the appellant’s Board, they were  not being  paid the  salaries on par with regular clerks. Therefore, they are entitled to the payment of equal pay on  par  with  clerks.  The  High  Court  accepted  that contention and directed payment of equal pay on par with the clerks. Two contentions  have been  raised by  the appellant in the  High   Court.  Firstly,  on  merits  and  secondly,  on jurisdiction. With  regard  to  the  merits,  namely,  their entitlement to  payment of  equal pay  for equal work on par with  the   clerks,  there  was  a  settlement  between  the appellant and  the employees.  In terms  thereof, they  were paid the wages. That settlement was brought to the notice of this Court  in pending  W.P. (C)  No.788/87 and  batch. This Court, by  order dated  May 10,  1991, disposed  of the writ petitions  in   terms  of   the  settlement.   Thereby   the controversy on merits no longer survives. The only  question that remains for decision is whether the High Court has jurisdiction to decide the dispute of the daily wage  employees working  under the appellant. The High Court took  the view that since the daily wage employees are not appointed  to a  post, the  Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985  (for   short,  ‘the  Act’)  is  not  applicable.  This controversy also is no longer res integra. In Union of India vs. Deep  Chand Pandey,  [AIR 1993  SC 382], same contention was raised  with regard  to the casual typists working under the Deputy  Chief Engineer  (Construction) Central  Railway, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Gwalior. They  contended that under s.14 of the Act, all the jurisdiction, power  and authority exercisable by all courts excepting the  Supreme Court have been vested in the Central Administrative Tribunal. Therefore, it was contended for the Union that  the High  Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the claims of the casual typists on daily wage basis. It was contended on  behalf of  the daily  wage typists  that since they were  not holding  any civil  post under  the Union and were engaged only on casual basis, the provisions of the Act were not  attracted. This Court negatived the contention and held thus : ""The scope  of Article  323-A permitting the  Parliament   to  legislate  on  the subject  covered   therein  is,   having regard to  the language,  very wide, and by enacting 1985 Act this power has been exercised in  almost  full  measure.  An examination of  Section 14  and  Section 3(q)  clearly  indicates  that  the  Act covers a  very wide  field, and there is nothing to  suggest that  the provisions dealing with  the  jurisdiction  of  the Tribunal   should   receive   a   narrow interpretation. This  is also  supported by the clarification offered by the then Minister of  Law, who  was piloting  the Bill, while  replying to  the demand for the   further    enumeration   of    the conditions of  service in Section 15 and 15. x x x x x x x x x x "" In view  of the  law thus  laid, we  hold that the High Court had  been divested,  in the  present case  too, of the power and jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and  the   same  vested   in  the  Administrative  Tribunals constituted in that behalf under the Act. However, since  the claims on merits have been settled, we decline  to interfere  with the  matter.  The  appeal  is accordingly disposed of. No costs.

1400," JUDGMENT O   R   D   E   R This is an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 praying for appointment of a sole arbitrator.  The application has been placed before me as a nominee of the learned Chief Justice of India for necessary orders.  The petitioner is a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands while the respondent is an Indian company.  The parties had entered into an agreement regarding certain works to be executed by the petitioner.  Disputes appeared to have arisen between the parties.  The agreement between the parties admittedly contains an arbitration clause which runs as under: ""23.    Arbitration Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement its breach or interpretation thereof, shall be determined by reference to a sole Arbitrator to be in accordance with the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Rules framed thereunder.  The venue of the arbitration shall be at England (UK).  The language to be used in the arbitration shall be the English language.  This clause shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement."" As per the above agreement a sole arbitrator has to be appointed. Parties have been unable to agree as to who should be the sole arbitrator. This has led to the present application being filed for appointment of the sole arbitrator. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner drew my attention to the fact that the petitioner company is a company incorporated in Netherlands while the respondent Company is a  Company incorporated in India.  He prayed that in view of provisions of Sections 11 (9) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, an arbitrator having a neutral nationality be appointed meaning thereby that the sole arbitrator should neither be a Dutch national nor be an Indian national.  Section 11 (9) is reproduced as under: ""11 (9) In the case of appointment of sole or third arbitrator in an international commercial arbitration, the Chief Justice of India or the person or institution designated by him may appoint an arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationalities of the parties where the parties belong to different nationalities."" The key word in the above provision is ’may’ which leaves a discretion in the Chief Justice or his nominee in this behalf and it is not mandatory that sole arbitrator should be of a nationality other than the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 nationalities of the parties to the agreement. I have the benefits of judgments of this Court on this aspect in Malaysian Airlines Systems BHD (II) v. STIC Travels (P) Ltd. [2001 (1) SCC 509].  While dealing with the same provision this Court has held that the use of the word ’may’ indicated that this aspect may be kept in view while appointing the sole arbitrator but the provision is not mandatory.  In this decision this Court considered similar provisions in the laws of various countries and held that the word ’may’ in Section 11(9) of the Act is not indicated to be read as ’must’ or ’shall’.  The said decision was followed by this Court  in Grid Corpn. Of Orissa Ltd. v. AES Corpn. and others [2002 (7) SCC 736.  In view of this legal position it is clear that Section 11(9) of the Arbitration & Conciliation act is not a mandatory provision. Accordingly, I am not bound to appoint a Sole Arbitrator having neutral nationality.  I hereby appoint Mr. Justice S.N. Variava, a retired Judge of this Court, as the sole arbitrator in this case.  The address of Justice Variava is 7-B, Rockside, 116, Walkeshwar Road, Mumbai- 400 006.  The remuneration of the arbitrator and the other costs that may be involved, particularly in view of the fact that the venue of arbitration as per the arbitration clause has to be at England (U.K.) shall be fixed by the arbitrator. The petition is disposed of accordingly. A copy of this order be forwarded by the Registry of the Court to Mr. Justice S.N.

1401," O R D E R In this  appeal,  the  only  question  is  whether  the appellant is  a legitimate  child of  her father, Ram Singh. Though all  the courts  concurrently have  found that she is the daughter  of Ram  Singh and  her mother Gurnam Kaur, the finding recorded is that she is illegitimate child since the marriage of  Gurnam Kaur  with her  previous husband was not legally dissolved.  Section 16  of the  Hindu Marriage  Act, 1955, as amended by Amendment Act 68 of 1976 reads as under: ""Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of  such marriage  who  would have   been   legitimate   if   the marriage had  been valid,  shall be legitimate, whether  such child  is born   before    or.   after    the commencement of  the marriage  Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976), and whether  or  not  a  decree  of nullity is  granted in  respect  of that marriage  under this  Act  and whether or not the marriage is held to be  valid otherwise  than  on  a petition under the Act."" Preceding the  amendment, declaration  of nullity  by a decree of  a Court  is a pre-condition. Amendment 68 of 1976 has done  away with it and declared that notwithstanding the marriage is  null and  void under  Section 11,  any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been  valid shall  be legitimate  whether such  child is born before or after the commencement of the Amendment 68 of 1976 and  whether or  not a  decree of nullity is granted in respect of  that marriage  under the  Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise then on a petition under the  Act. Thus  it would  be clear that declaration of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 validity of  a marriage on a petition of either party or, in other words,  declaration of the marriage as nullity under a decree which  were preconditions under Section 12 of the Act is done  away with.  Consequentially, as if the marriage had been valid, the child shall be legitimate whether such child was born before or after the commencement of Act 68 of 1976. By operation  of Section  8 of the Hindu Succession Act 1956 read with  Schedule I,  appellant being  the daughter of Ram Singh, is entitled to the property of her father. The decree is  accordingly   granted.  Application   for  appointing  a guardian of the minor is allowed.

The first appellant met with a motor accident and as a result thereof he was paralysed due to head injury.  It was found by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal that he was having 100% disability and that he was an agriculturist having five acres of land. The Tribunal on assessment of the evidence led by the parties fixed a sum of Rs.10,000/- as yearly income from agriculture and taking into consideration the age of the appellant, multiplier of 13 was applied and was awarded an amount of Rs.1,30,000/- towards loss of earning capacity; Rs. 20,000/- towards the pain and suffering suffered by him; Rs. 3,000/- towards the cost of hospitalization; and Rs.50,000/- towards continued loss of amenities, totalling to  a compensation of Rs. 2,03,000/-.  Aggrieved by the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the appellant approached the High Court of Kerala. The High Court partly allowed the appeal and modified the award. The High Court was of the view that the income of the appellant should have been assessed on the basis of notional income of a non- earning person as fixed in the Second Schedule to the Motor Vehicles Act.  Considering that the appellant would be entitled to Rs.1,95,000/- as loss in earning capacity, the High Court thus enhanced the amount of compensation under that head by an amount of Rs.65,000/-.  The High Court was further of the view that the appellant would require the life-long attention and for that he would be requiring by- standers/nursing expenses and awarded Rs.20,000/- on that account. Considering the long term treatment from 1.7.1996 to 30.7.1996 in hospital and the nature of the injury sustained, the compensation towards medical expenses was enhanced by an additional amount of Rs.10,000/-. 3.      Thus, in the appeal the High Court has enhanced the amount of compensation by an amount of Rs.95,000/- with 7%  interest per annum from the date of application till the date of deposit.  Aggrieved by the said order on account of inadequate compensation under the headings of loss of income, pain and suffering and continuous loss of amenities, the present appeal has been filed. 4.      It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the assessment of compensation on the basis of notional income of a non- earning person according to the Second Schedule to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, of  Rs.15,000/- as notional yearly income of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 accident victim applying the special provisions of Section 163A of the Act was not correct when the evidence has been led to show that the appellant was an agriculturist and holding 5 acres of land. 5.      The assessment of damages to compensate the claimants is beset with difficulties because from the nature of the things, it depends on many factors such as the amount that the deceased would have earned during the remainder of his life, the chances that the deceased may not have lived to their life expectancy, the chances that the deceased might get more or less income. 6.      In the present case, although the first appellant has placed material before the court to show that he owned the agricultural lands but there is no convincing evidence to prove the income out of that. That apart, since he owned the land it cannot be said that there is a total loss of income due to the injury suffered by the appellant: thus, the calculation of the amount of compensation on the basis of the notional income cannot be faulted with. 7.      For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any good or sufficient reason to interfere with the order passed by the High Court. 8.      The appeal is dismissed.","The first appellant met with a motor accident and as a result thereof he was paralysed due to head injury.

The admitted  position is that one  Ashfaq Hussain  was an  evacuee having migrated to Pakistan. His  property was  vested in  the Custodian  under U.P. Custodian  of Evacuee  Properties Act.  Thereafter  the Central Act  had taken  over the  operation of  the  evacuee properties.  The   records  disclose   that  the   Assistant Custodian, Farrukhabad  at Kanpur  had passed an order dated June 22,  1961 in  which it  was held  that the  interest of Ashfaq Hussain had been shown as evacuee interest and it was directed that  the order  be communicated  to all  the major shareholders for  information. It  was found  that the order was accordingly  communicated to all the major shareholders. Admittedly, a  revision application  came  to  be  filed  on August 16,  1975, that  is, practically after 14 years under Section 27  of the  Administration of the Evacuee Properties Act, 1950   [for short, the ""Act""]. The Additional Custodian General had  declined to  interfere with the order. When the petitioner had  called that  order in  question in  the writ petition, the  High Court held that the Additional Custodian General had  properly exercised  the revisional jurisdiction and it  declined to  interfere with  the order  due  to  the inordinate delay  in filing  the revision. Thus this special leave petition. It is sought to be contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner  that the  judgment relied  upon by  the High Court is not of any help to the view taken by the High Court and that,  therefore, the  High Court  was not  right in its conclusion. This  Court in  Purshotam Lal  Dhawan  v.  Diwan Chaman Lal  [AIR 1961  SC 1371]  has held that Section 27 of the Administration  of Evacuee Properties Act, 1950 does not prescribe  any   period  of  limitation,  but  Rule  31  (5) prescribes limitation  of 60  days for filling an appeal and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that it would provide as guide to the revisional authorities to exercise  the revisional  power reasonable  and faily. In that case,  entertaining the  revision within  one year  was held to  be not unreasonable. In that behalf, this Court has held that  the powers of the Custodian General under Section 27 read  with Rule  31(5) are  not intended  to be exercised arbitrarily. Being  a judicial  power, he shall exercise his discretion reasonably and it is him to consider whether in a particular case  he should  entertain a  revision beyond the period of  sixty days stated in Rule 31(5). It was held that the exercise  of the  revisional powers  after one  year was held to be not unreasonable. It is  seen that  the petitioners  had slept  over  the rights over  the property  well over  14 years by which time even the  persons in possession had perfected their title by prescription. Under  those circumstances,  a person  who was not diligent  in exercising  his rights  and  allowed  third party rights  to accrue,  cannot be permitted to agitate the right after  an inordinate  delay. The  revisional authority has rightly  declined to  interfere  with  the  order  after inordinate delay.  Though revisional  power was given to the revisional authority  without limitation,it  is settled  law that the  revisional powers  should be  exercised keeping in view the rights of the parties and the effect of exercise of the revisional  powers and  all other  relevant facts. Under these circumstances,  we cannot hold that the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petition. The Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.","Ashfaq Hussain was an evacuee having migrated to Pakistan. His property was vested in the Custodian under the Evacuee Properties Act.

The short question which arises for determination in these civil appeals is : whethe r the appellant-assessee was liable to pay additional tax on account of adjustment on its return for the assessment year 1996-97 and 1997-98 under Section 143(1)(a) read with Section 143(1A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 vide order dated 17.12.1997. During the relevant assessment years, appellant claimed deduction under Section 80-O of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short ""1961 Act"") in respect of qualifying income brought into India in convertible foreign exchange.  In its return, appellant indicated the qualifying income as gross figure.  By way of adjustment, under Section 143(1)(a) of the 1961 Act, the ITO restricted the qualifying income to the net figure.  In other words, assessee claimed gross income, earned in foreign exchange, as qualifying income whereas the ITO granted deduction by restricting the claim of the assessee to the net income. On 17.12.1997 the question : as to whether the eligible income should be taken at th e gross figure or net figure, was the question of interpretation.  There were several conflicting decisions on this point.  Therefore, according to appellant, Section 143(1)(a) was not applicable and consequently the appellant is not liable to pay additional tax under Section 143(1A).  At this stage, it may be noted that subsequently regular assessment was carried out by the ITO under Section 143(3).  We are not concerned in this case with regular assessment under Section 143(3). The only point raised by the appellant is that it is not liable to pay additional ta x as Section 143(1)(a), as it stood during the relevant year, was not applicable to the facts of this case because a moot point had arisen which could not have been a matter of adjustment under that section and which point needed consideration and determination only under regular assessment vide Section 143(3) of the 1961 Act. We find merit in this civil appeal.  As stated above, we are concerned with the assessment years 1996-97 and 1997-98.  One of the main conditions stipulated by way of the first proviso to Section 143(1)(a), as it stood during the relevant time, referred to prima facie adjustments.  The first proviso permitted the Department to make adjustments in the income or loss declared in the return in cases of arithmetical errors or in cases where any loss carried forward or deduction or disallowance which on the basis of information available in such return was prima facie admissible but which was not claimed in the return or in cases where any loss carried forward, or deduction or allowance claimed in the return which on the basis of information available in such return was prima facie inadmissible.  In the present case, therefore, when there were conflicting judgments on interpretation of Section 80-O, in our view, prima facie http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 adjustments contemplated under Section 143(1)(a) was not applicable and, therefore, consequently appellant was not liable to pay additional tax under Section 143(1A) of the 1961 Act. Before concluding, we may reiterate that in this case we are not concerned with the order of the assessment passed by the ITO later on under regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the 1961 Act. For the above reasons, the impugned judgment is set aside and the civil appeals, filed by the assessee, stand allowed with no order as to costs.","Assessee claimed deduction under Section 80-O of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short ""1961 Act"") in respect of qualifying income brought into India in convertible foreign exchange.

1411," JUDGMENT 2000 Supp(4) SCR 41 The following Order of the Court was delivered : These appeals have been preferred by the Central Bureau of Investigation challenging the order of a Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court by which two out of six accused were discharged from trial proceedings. The third as Mr. Bangrappa a former Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka and sixth accused Mr. Suri Babu was his Private Secretary while he was holding office as Chief Minister. Those two accused were discharged by the impugned order. They and four others were chargesheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation for the offences under Sec. 13(2) read with Sec. 13(l)(d) and Sec. 7,12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 read with Sec. 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The first accused is shown as Principal of one P.C. Dental and Nursing College, Bangalore, second accused was shown as the Minister for Health in the Ministry headed by the third accused Bangarappa and the fourth accused was the Chairman of the said P.C. Dental and Nursing College, (apart from being a sitting M.L.A.) and accused No. 5 was Chairman of the Local Enquiry Committee appointed by the Bangalore University. The trial court heard the accused in the matter of framing charge and passed a detailed order on 8.1.1999 holding that the evidence produced by the prosecution is sufficient to frame charge against the accused persons. The said order of the Special Judge was challenged by the respondents in these appeals before the High Court in Criminal Revision Petition Nos. 112/99 and 174/99. Both were heard together and by a common order (which is under challenge in these appeals) learned single judge discharged those accused, but at the same time directed the case to be proceeded as against the remaining accused. The appellant - C.B.I. had raised various grounds assailing the reasoning advanced by the learned single judge for discharging the respondents. As the arguments were started we expressed the consequence of dealing with a petition filed by the accused for discharging them and pointed out the dangers involved for either side if this Court is to reach any finding on the contentious issues. At the said stage, learned counsel for the respondent sought time to get instructions in the matter. Today under instructions from the respondents, it was submitted before us by Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel that those respondents would withdraw the revision petitions filed before the High Court for discharge, without prejudice to their rights to raise appropriate contentions before the trial court at the appropriate stage. Mr. Altaf Ahmad, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the C.B.I. submitted that he has no objection to the said course being adopted as it would enable the trial to proceed to its logical end. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In the light of the said submission that revision petitions filed before the High Court are withdrawn we do not think it necessary to go into the contentions or grounds raised in these appeals for assailing the reasoning adopted by the learned single judge. We order that the revision petitions filed in the High Court by the respondents would stand withdrawn and consequently the impugned order will stand erased. If the trial court is to decide any question which had been dealt with in the impugned judgment the same shall be decided as though the High Court has not pronounced any opinion on such questions thus far.

1412," O R D E R Leave granted. This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the High  Court of  Allahabad dated  February 3,  1994 in FA No.233/88. 5.357  acres of  agricultural  land  situated  in Daoodpur, Pargana Chinaiya-kot Tehsil Mohammadabad, District Azamgarh was  acquired for construction of Sirsa Alpika. The Land Acquisition Officer in his award dated January 10, 1985 determined compensation @ Rs.3,658.87 per acre. Dissatisfied therewith, the  respondent sought reference under Section 18 of the  Land Acquisition  Acts 1894  to the Civil Court. The Civil Court  in its award and decree dated February 17, 1988 enhanced  the   compensation  to   Rs.30,000/-   per   acre. Dissatisfied with the award of the Reference Court, both the claimants as  well as  the State  filed the  appeal. In  the impugned judgment,  the learned judge granted compensation @ Rs. 69,013.11 per acre. Thus this appeal by special leave. It is  settled law  that in  reference under Section 18 claimant being  dissatisfied with  the  award  of  the  Land Acquisition Officer,  when the  proceedings are  taken under Section 20 of the Act, burden is always on the claimant like plaintiff to  adduce reliable  and  acceptable  evidence  to prove proper, just and adequate compensation to the acquired land. If  such an  evidence was adduced, burden shifts on to the State to disprove it. It is further settled law that the sales transactions filed either in the narration of award or documents, without  examination of  either the  vendee or by the vendor  is not  evidence. It is the duty of the Court to carefully assess  the evidence  on the  touch stone of human conduct and  prudent purchaser.  Admittedly, in  this  case, though reference to four sales transactions had been made by the reference  Court, neither  the vendee nor the vendor was examined nor  was it established that the sale consideration which passed thereunder is true and the prices for which the sales came  to be  executed were  real one  between  willing http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 vendor  and  willing  vendee.  Equally,  burden  is  on  the claimant to  establish that  the lands relating to the sales transactions and  the lands  under acquisition are possessed of same  value, nature  of the lands are same and capable to fetch same price, and so also other situations as comparable features. Unfortunately, neither the reference Court nor the High Court  has looked  into this legal aspect of the matter and proceeded  on the  terms of  those  sale  deeds.  It  is equally settled  law that  the Courts  should avoid feats of imaginations to  fix fanciful price, and sit in the armchair of willing  vendee to see whether a prudent purchaser acting in normal  market condition  would be  willing to  offer the price which  are mentioned  in the sale instances. The Court should clearly  and  carefully  evaluate  the  evidence  and determine market  value  avoiding  needless  burden  on  the exchequer and  according adequate  and just  compensation to the acquired  land. The  very approach adopted by the courts below is  beset with  illegalities and, therefore, we do not find any  legal basis  to consider the evidence on record to determine proper and adequate compensation in respect of the acquired land. Under these  circumstances, we  are left with no option but to set aside the decree and award of the reference Court as well  as of  the High  Court and  remit the matter to the reference Court  to give  an opportunity  to the claimant as well as  the Land  Acquisition Officer to adduce evidence in the case and then to determine the compensation according to law. The  appeal   is  accordingly   allowed  but,   in  the circumstances, the  parties are  directed to  bear their own costs.","5.357 acres of agricultural land situated in Daoodpur, Pargana Chinaiya-kot Tehsil Mohammadabad, District Azamgarh was acquired for construction of Sirsa Alpika.

It had been listed earlier  and learned  Attorney  General  had  entered appearance on behalf of the Union of India. We have  heard the  petition. It  has been  couched  in unsavoury language  and the petitioner seems to have made an intentional attempt  to indulge  in mud-slinging against the advocates,  this   Court  in   particu  lar  as  also  other constitutional institutions.  Many of the allegations in his writ petition are likely to lower the prestige of this Court as the  apex judicial  institution. At one place in the writ petition, he has alleged:- ""Thus the working of the Judges are cocktail based on Western Common Laws and American techniques, as such  unproductive  and  out  dated  according  to socio-economic conditions of the country. "" At one another place, the petitioner has stated that: ""This Court  has become a constitutional liability without having  control over  the illegal  acts of the Government ...... Thus the people for whom the Constitution is  meant have  now turned down their faces against  it which  is a did-illusionment for fear that justice is a will of the Wisp."" Yet at  another place  the petitioner  has stated  that this Court  is sleeping  over the  issues like ’Kumbhkarna.’ The reading  of the  writ petition gives the impression that it is clearly intended to denigrate this Court in the esteem of the  people of India. We are of the priam facie view that the petition  has been  drawn up  with a designed purpose of bringing the  Court into  contempt and  the  petitioner  is, therefore, prima facie guilty of contempt. The writ  petition  has  been  drafted  in  a  careless manner. At  several places the pleadings are meaningless. At several other places 443 they  are   contradictory.The  allegations  are  clumsy  and several irrelevant  facts have been put into the petition to inflate its size. The petitioner  has left  out no  institution from  his attempt of  mud-slinging.  We  have  a  feeling  that  while drawing  up  the  petition  the  petitioner  has  considered himself to  be the only blemishless person and everyone else including social  institutions to  be blame-worthy.  We  are surprised that  an advocate  practising in  this Court  with considerable experience  has  choosen  to  act  in  such  an irresponsible manner.  The writ  petition, in  our  opinion, therefore,  deserves   to  be  dismissed.  We,  accordingly, dismiss the writ petition.

We have no doubt that it is in this sense that the word ’propagate’ has been used in Article 25 (1), for what the Article grants is not the right to convert another person to one’s own religion, but to transmit or spread one’s religion by an exposition of its tenets. It has to be remembered that Article 25 (1) guarantees ""freedom of conscience"" to every citizen, and not merely to the followers of one particular religion, and that, in turn, postulates that there is no fundamental right to convert another person to one’s own religion because if a person purposely undertakes the conversion of another person to his religion, as distinguished from his effort to transmit or spread the tenets of religion, that would impinge on the ""freedom of conscience"" guaranteed to all the citizens of the country alike.""

We have also perused the written submissions filed by the petitioners before the High Court, but we do not find any specific ground questioning the said Rule other than mentioned hereinbefore was raised before the High Court. Furthermore, the question as to whether a rule is ultra vires or not, must be adjudged having regard to public order in mind.

The appellant has placed material before us and also before the Labour Court that the workman has worked only for 227 days in about  four years as per the following description as contained in para 5 of the reply to the statement of claim :- ""December, 1987                 4 days January, 1988                  27 days February, 1988               25 days March, 1988                    27 days March, 1990                    23 days April, 1990                  23 days May, 1990                            20 days July, 1990                           18 days August, 1990                   18 days December, 1991               14 days January, 1992                  24 days February, 1992               04 days ___________________ Total Days 227 days"" __________________ The respondent has not worked for 240 days in one calendar year which is the condition precedent for attracting provisions of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  This apart, the workman was a causal house assistant who never worked for 240 days continuously in one calendar year.  As per the provisions of Section 25(B) of the Industrial Disputes Act, there should be working of 240 days in one calendar year.  Hence, the provisions of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act are not attracted in the instant case for the reason that the respondent worked only for 227 days in about 4 years period from the date of his initial appointment i.e. 28.12.1987 to the date of termination i.e. 07.02.1992.  In our opinion, the learned Single Judge as also the learned Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court have committed a mistake of law in ordering reinstatement with back wages etc.  This apart, the order passed by the Division Bench is also non-speaking. As already noticed, it is the settled proposition of law that when the initial appointment itself is void then the provisions of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act are not applicable while terminating the services of the workman.  The respondent-workman has also not placed before the Labour Court the relevant documents and not even summoned the records before the Labour Court.  It is seen from the records that neither the Labour Court called for the records concerned nor the respondent-workman moved http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 an application before the Labour Court for summoning the records. The respondent-workman led no cogent and convincing evidence before the Labour Court.  Accordingly, the award passed by the Labour Court deserves to be quashed and set aside. For the aforesaid reasons, we set aside the order of reinstatement and back wages passed by the courts below.  The appeal stands allowed accordingly.  No costs. We make it clear that if any payment is made to the respondent during the pendency of appeal in this Court, the same shall not be recovered. In view of the order now passed, the proceedings before the Labour Court under Section 33C(2) has become infructuous. 27862","The Labour Court has held that the appellant has worked for 240 days.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the present appellant. Challenge in the writ petition was to the order passed by the Presiding Officer, Labour Court 1, Faridabad. 3.      Background facts in a nutshell are as follows: Respondent claiming to have been appointed by the appellant as a baildar in December, 1991 alleged that while working with the appellant, had met with an accident and FIR was lodged.  Respondent could not attend the duties and the reasons for the absence were within the knowledge of the management of the appellant.  The management was also requested to provide for reimbursement of medical aid to the claimant who was admitted in the hospital and continuously long thereafter.  The accident in question occurred on 21.8.1992. Accordingly a claim petition was filed.  The prayers made in the claim petition were resisted by the present appellant. It was stated that as per official records respondent had only worked for 179 days. The Labour Court did not accept the plea and held that respondent had worked for more than 240 days. The award was challenged before the High Court. However, the High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the services have been illegally terminated and therefore the respondent was entitled to full  back wages.  It was held that back wages is the normal rule and party objecting to it must establish the circumstances necessitating departure. The High Court placed reliance on a Full Bench decision of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Hari Palace, Ambala City v. The Presiding Officer, Labour Court and Anr. (Punjab Law Report, Vol. LXXXI-1979, 720). 4.      In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no material whatsoever placed by the claimant before the Labour  Court that it was appointed towards any sanctioned post and was entitled to full  back wages. It was also submitted that official records clearly http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 established that he had worked for 179 days. Holidays have wrongly been taken into account. Even then the number of days does not exceed 210 days. 5.      Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that since no reason has been indicated the impugned order cannot be maintained.  The High Court has recorded an abrupt conclusion without any material.   It is submitted that the case should not have been decided merely placing reliance on some other decision without even indicating as to how the factual scenario is the same. 6.      Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the judgment of the Labour Court and the High Court. 7.       It seems that the High Court has not analysed the factual position and has come to an abrupt conclusion by relying on some earlier decision to hold that the appellant was not entitled to any relief.  The approach is certainly casual. It is to be noted that one of the major grounds urged was that the onus was wrongly placed on the appellant to show that the respondent had not worked for 240 days continuously. 8.      In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh consideration in accordance with law. 9.      Appeal is allowed.","Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.C. granted leave to appeal against the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the present appellant.

1419," O R D E R Delay condoned. Substitution ordered. Leave granted.  We have  heard the  learned counsel  on both sides. The admitted  position is  that the civil Court decreed the suit  for eviction against the appellant holding that he was not a tenant which order had become final. The same plea of want  of jural  relationship is  sought to  be raised  in execution. When the objection raised was negatived, the High Court in  Writ Petition  No.3319  of  1992  by  order  dated November 22,  1991 directed  the executing  Court to go into the question. Accordingly, this appeal by special leave came to be filed. Shri  Bhasme,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents, contended that  in view of the specific language employed in Section 85-A  of the  Bombay Tenancy  and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948  the only  competent authority that has to go into the question  is the  revenue authority  under the  Act  and civil Court  has no  jurisdiction to  go into  the  question whether the  appellant is  a tenant  or not.  Therefore, the High Court  was right in directing the executing Court to go into  the  question.  It  is  rather  unfortunate  that  the respondent has  allowed the  decree holding that he is not a tenant to  become final.  Having allowed it to become final, it is  not open  to him to contend that he is still a tenant under the  Act and  therefore the  decree is  nullity. Under those  circumstances,  the  executing  Court  was  right  in refusing  to  entertain  the  objection  for  executing  the decree.  The   High  Court   was  not   justified,  in   the circumstances, in  directing the executive Court to consider the objection. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.","Civil Court decreed the suit for eviction against the appellant holding that he was not a tenant which order had become final.

By  this  Order a detention Order dated 7th April, 1999  has been  quashed  on  the ground that in the Affidavit  of  the Sponsoring  Authority it has been mentioned that the  Detenu was involved in six cases and that in the detention Order it has  been  stated  that  the Detenu  was  involved  in  four occurrences  in  four different cases.  It is held that  the Detenu  had been given copies of documents in respect of one case  only even though the Detaining Authority was bound  to give  copies in all the six cases.  It is held that thus the Detenu  had  been denied an effective opportunity to  defend himself.  On this ground the detention Order was set aside. It  is correct that the Detaining Authority has to apply its  mind before issuing a Detention Order.  However, it  is equally  important  that the Court, hearing a Habeas  Corpus Petition  under  Article 226 of the Constitution  of  India, also  applies its mind before it quashes a Detention  Order. Undoubtedly,  in  the  Affidavit  filed  by  the  Sponsoring Authority  reliance has been placed on six cases.   However, the  Detaining  Authority  has not placed  reliance  on  six cases.   This itself shows that the Detaining Authority  had applied its mind and not gone just by what was stated by the Sponsoring Authority. In Para 2 of the impugned Order it is stated as follows: ""2.   In  sub-para  2 of paragraph 3 of the  grounds  of detention  it  is stated as follows:  ""He has committed  the above   mentioned  offences  in  Sobanapuram,   Koppampatti, Manamalai,  Anaikkal which are rich in sandalwood and  other species and wild life."" The  detenu  is  stated to have been  involved  in  four occurrence in four different cases.  ."" http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 From the statement extracted above it has been concluded that  there were four occurrences in four different  places. However,  the same Detention Order also sets out as follows: ""On  16-3-99  on  a reliable information, the  Forest  Range Officer,  Perambalur and incharge of Thuraiyur Range, formed a  special  party  led by him, proceeded at about  5  PM  to conduct  forest  offences  raid   at  Sobanapuram   Section, Koppampatti beat, Manmalai Reserve Forest Jee road."" Thus  it  is  clear  that   Sobanapuram  is  a  Section, Koppampatti  is  a  beat, Manmalai is a reserve  forest  and Anaikkal is a name of the road.  A careful reading shows the Detention  Order does not refer to four occurrences in  four different places, but is only mentioning that an offence had taken  place  in  Sobanapuram   section,  Koppampatti  beat, Manamalai  forest and at Anaikkal road.  Had the High  Court applied its mind properly, it would have realised that there were   no  four  occurrences  in  four   different   places. Admittedly,  the Detenu has been given copy of the documents in the adverse case relied upon. In  our  view, there has been total  non-application  of mind  on the part of the High Court.  The impugned Order  of the  High  Court  cannot be sustained and it is  hereby  set aside. However,  the Detention Order was of 1999.  The same had been quashed by the High Court in March 2000.  The period of detention  is  over.  In our view, this is not a case  where the  Detenu  should  be  made to surrender  to  undergo  the remaining period of detention. The  Appeal stands disposed off accordingly.  There will be no Order as to costs. ..J. (M. B. SHAH) ..J. (S. N. VARIAVA) February 20, 2001.","This appeal is against an Order dated 10th March, 2000.

1421," JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 2635/05) Leave granted. Respondent No.1 was appointed as Assistant Teacher in Paranjape-Motiwale High School on 15.6.1970 where she continued upto 8.5.1984. Thereafter, the respondent was on leave till 8.6.1986. She  resigned from her post on 9.6.1986 and  joined respondent No.3, Maharashstra Mitra Mandal Madhyamik Shala on 10.6.1990 which is after four years. After rejoining service with Respondent No.3,  she continued on the post upto her superannuation on 31st December,2003.  Thus the total length of service rendered  on the post by respondent No.1 was 13 years, 6 months and 20 days. The service was pensionable. If the break period is added, then she would have been entitled to additional pensionary benefits, and keeping this in view respondent moved an application on 26.12.2003 for condonation of break in service.  The application was rejected on 24.3.2004 by the authorised officer.  This decision of the officer refusing condonation  of break in service, was challenged by respondent No.1 by filing Writ Petition No.4404 of 2004 before the High Court.  The High Court has directed the State of Maharashtra to condone the break in service to respondent from 9.6.1986 to 10.6.1990 and to refix the pension by taking into consideration her total service from 15.6.1970 to 31.12.2003, and thereafter pay the pensionary benefits to her accordingly. For giving the aforesaid direction, the High Court has relied upon State Government  Resolution dated 12th November,1976 as well as Government Notification dated 10.5.1989. Learned counsel for the appellant-State has brought to our notice Government  Resolution,  Education  and Social Welfare Department dated 4th November,1968 whereunder for condoning the break in service, the period of each break should not exceed six months and the total period of permissible 6 breaks should not exceed 2 years;  and Circular dated 10.5.1989 whereunder total duration of breaks must not be more than 2 years. The High Court has failed to notice this part of the GR and was impressed by the fact that the power to condone the break in service, which vests with the authority,  should have been exercised in favour of respondent No.1.  On the face of the Circular, whererunder the power to condone the break in service  exceeding the period of two years does not vest with the Government,  the High Court has committed an error in issuing the aforesaid direction.  That being the case, the  appeal is allowed  and the order passed by the High Court is set aside.",The High Court has set aside the order passed by the High Court is set aside.

1422," JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (4) SCR 191 The following Order of the Court was delivered ; These are two appeals by a learned advocate who stands convicted under section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act for having committed the contempt of the court of a learned Magistrate before whom he was conducting a trial for an accused person. Amongst others, one of the Charges against the appellant was that he had at a certain juncture raised the pitch of his voice unusually high to the annoyance of the Learned Magistrate, and besides, had used derogatory language against him. After the incident, the appellant got published and circulated certain posters and caused a demonstration staged which got reported to the High Court whereupon  action was  taken against the appellant. We have gone through both the judgments of the High Court and have heard learned counsel. We have no reason to disbelieve the learned Magistrate on the actual happenings, even though effort has been made by Mr. Anam, learned counsel for the appellant to question the same. We are of the view that when the appellant was warned of his unruly behaviour, he should, have stopped and gone in tune with the learned Magistrate and not retained a defiant and aggressive posture. It should be borne in mind by one and all that lawyers were created for the courts, not courts for the lawyers. The happy combination, whenever  an aberration occurs, should in immediacy be restored and put to an even keel. Mr. Anam with all his sincerity has expressed before us that the appellant is apologitic for his misbehaviour. We regretfully will not be able to accept his apology at this belated juncture, but would rather admonish the appellant for his conduct under our plenary powers under the Constitution, which we do hereby. Having done so, we would set aside the payment of fine. The appellant need not pay the imposed fine Rs; 2000 in Criminal Appeal No. 678 Of 1991, However, the sums of Rs.5000 and Rs. 10,000 which have been ordered to be paid by the appellant to the Kerala Legal Aid Board under orders under challenge in the respective two appeals are meant for a good cause and those orders we do not upset. This course should set everything at  rest.  The appeals  are disposed of accordingly.",A learned advocate was convicted under section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act.

Bharti Reddy, Advs. for the Respondent O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted. The respondent  was  imputed  with  a  charge  that  he demanded  and  accepted  a  sum  of  Rs.3,000/-  as  illegal gratification for refraining from registering a complaint in respect  of   the  bribe   given,    against  whom  criminal prosecution was  to be initiated. The matter was referred to the Tribunal for disciplinary proceeding which after enquiry submitted its  report on  July 20,   1994,  holding that the charge against  the respondent  had been  proved and  he was guilty of the charge.  However, it recommended to impose the penalty of  stoppage of  three  increments  with  cumulative effect.   The Government after consideration of the evidence found that  the recommendation  was not  correct proper  and that major  penalty was  required to be given.  Accordingly, show cause  notice, together  with copy  of the  report, was issued for imposing punishment of dismissal from service and the respondent  submitted his  reply.   The Government after considering the  entire material came to the conclusion that the  respondent  deserved  to  be  dismissed  from  service. Accordingly,   order, viz.  G.O.Ms. No.238  Home (SCA) dated July 28, 1995 dismissing him service was issued. On the O.A. having been  filed before  the Tribunal.  The Tribunal while accepting that  the charge  had been  proved was of the view that  the  Government  should  reconsider  the  question  of imposition of  the penalty  of stoppage of three increments. Thus, this  appeal by  special leave  against the  order  of Tribunal made on April 23, 1996 in O.A. No. 4297. Shri L.N.  Rao,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent contends that  the Tribunal  in disciplinary proceedings had opined that  the evidence  of  the  witness  was  weak  and, therefore, it  felt like holding that the charge of imposing penalty of  stoppage of  three increments would meet the end http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of justice.   In  view of the finding given by the Tribunal, that imposition  of the  penalty of  dismissal from  service shook the  conscience of  the Tribunal,  it does not warrant interference.   We find  no force  in the contention.  It is now legal settled position that imposition of the penalty is the right  of the disciplinary authority consistent with the magnitude and  the misconduct  imputed and  the evidence  in support thereof.   The  Tribunal in disciplinary proceedings found as  a fact  that the  respondent demanded and accepted illegal gratification of Rs. 3,000/- for not prosecuting the offender.   Since the  respondent is an Inspector of Police, a higher  ranking officer, if he demands and accepts illegal gratification  and   restrains   himself   from   initiating prosecution   against the  offender, it would have an effect on  the  maintenance  of  law  and  order  in  the  society. Therefore, the  finding of  the Tribunal  that it  shook its conscience is  unsustainable. We have seen that the Tribunal has no  power to  direct the  appellant  to  reconsider  the matter.   This court  in B.C.  Chaturvedi vs. Union of India [(1995) 6  SCC 749] has held that the Tribunal has the power to direct  the punishment,    imposed  by  the  disciplinary authority. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  order of  the Tribunal stands  set aside.  As a  result, the  order of the Government stands confirmed.  No costs.","The respondent was imputed with a charge that he demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.3,000/- as illegal gratification for refraining from registering a complaint.

While he was about three furlongs away from village Barnala and was  proceeding towards  village  Nangal  Kalan,  he saw one person going on foot.  On seeing the police,  he  tried  to  hide  something which he  was  holding in his arms.  This conduct made Sohan Singh suspicious and, therefore, he went near him,  searched him  and  found  that he was carrying a single barrel rifle. As the appellant did not have any licence for  possessing  a fire-arm  and  live  cartidges, he came to be challenged and then prosecuted for the offences punishable under Section  5 of the TADA Act and Section 25 of the Arms Act. The prosecution examined Sohan Singh _ PW 3 to prove its  case  and  also supported the charge by examining other witnesses.

Some words written on the butt were also noticed.  Some  words  written on the  butt  were  also  noticed.    Some slogans were also written on the butt of the rifle.  All  these  details  were mentioned  by  Inspector  Sohan Singh in the FIR and also in the recovery memo.  Thus there can  be  no  doubt  that  the rifle  which  was  produced  before  the  court  was the one recovered from the appellant.  As the appellant  was  proved to  have  possessed a rifle and cartidges without a licence, in the notified area, his conviction under Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act is quite proper.

It is submitted that as per Section 12 of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Union & Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act (MRTU Act) on receipt of an application from a Union for recognition under Section 11 of the Industrial Court has to cause notice to be displayed on the notice board of the undertaking the date on which it intends to decide the said application. Under Clause (2), the Court can hold an enquiry in the matter before deciding the application.  Further under Section 11 Clause (1) any Union when it makes the application should have membership of not less than 30% of the total number of employees, for the whole of the period of six calendar months immediately preceding the calendar month of filing of application. In the instant case, respondent No.1 (Sarva Shramik Sangh) has filed an application No.8 of 1988 on 17.2.1988 for being granted recognition.  Similarly, the appellant herein (Vegetable Vitamin Foods Employees Union) filed an application No.20 of 2003 on 10.10.2003 for being granted recognition.

In the case of the appellant’s application,  it would have to consider whether the appellant had more than 30% of the employees as members in the six months immediately prior to 10.10.2003.

This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court whereby it has set aside the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge  dated 2nd August 2002 which in turn had quashed the order of dismissal from service made against the appellant herein and directing  his reinstatement with 50% back wages.  In the light of what has been stated by the learned counsel for the parties, we find that a detailed discussion on the matters in controversy would perhaps not be necessary.  The bare facts accordingly are being referred to. 3.      Shiva Anand, appellant herein, was an employee of the Indian Airlines and posted at Calcutta Airport.  In August 1998 he applied for a concessional air ticket for a visit to Delhi and then proceeded to Delhi on 22nd August 1998. On the 28th August 1998 he visited the Australian High Commission in New Delhi and applied for a visa for entry into Australia.  On September 2, 1998 he again visited the Australian High Commission and submitted an employer\022s certificate allegedly signed by Shri S.K. Basu, Senior Chief Manager of the Indian Airlines certifying that he had been granted privilege leave from September 1, 1998 to October 30, 1998.  It appears that in order to verify the correctness of the certificate the Australian High Commission got in touch with the Indian Airlines on which it was revealed that no such certificate had been issued by Shri S.K. Basu.  Disciplinary proceedings were accordingly initiated against the appellant for having produced a fake certificate in the name of Shri S.K.Basu and a charge-sheet dated 28th October 1998 was issued to him.  After a detailed enquiry which the appellant repeatedly tried to obstruct, the enquiry officer tendered his report recommending that he be dismissed from service on which the punishing authority passed a final order to that effect.  After some litigation between the parties which even brought the parties to this Court, the appellant filed a departmental appeal against the order of dismissal from service. The appeal too was rejected by order dated 18th January 2001.  Both the orders were impugned before the learned Single Judge and were quashed leading to the filing of the appeal before the Division Bench which reversed the same and upheld the order of dismissal.  It is in these http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 circumstances that the present appeal has been filed by Shiva Anand. 4.      We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length.  We are not inclined to interfere with the order of the Division Bench in the light of the issues that have been raised and the conduct of the appellant in attempting to produce a fake document along with his application for a visa. 5.      Faced with this situation, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted in the alternative that but for one aberration i.e. the present one, the appellant had a uniformally  good career for 27 years with the Indian Airlines and his expertise as a highly qualified master technician in Aircraft Engineering had been fully recognized and as the order of dismissal had foreclosed all chances of future employment it was perhaps appropriate that the order of dismissal be modified to one of termination of service so as to enable him to seek employment in some other organization.  Mr. Rao, the learned senior counsel for the respondent, Indian Airlines had sought time to take instructions, and has thereafter informed us that the Indian Airlines were inclined to accept the proposal so as to make the appellant eligible for future employment.  We accordingly modify the penalty of dismissal to termination of service.  We further direct that the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- which has been deposited in this Court shall be paid to the appellant to defray his expenses. 6.      The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.","Shiva Anand was an employee of the Indian Airlines and posted at Calcutta Airport.

The  appellant  insisted  upon  the respondents for  grant of  renewal of  the licence either to concede to  the title  of the  land of  the Government or to obtain any lease from the owners. Challenging the order, the respondents filed  the writ  petitions in the High Court. In similar cases,  the Division  Bench of the Bombay High Court directed that  the appellant would not insist upon conceding to the  title to the property. But appropriate authority was directed to  dispose of  the  pending  matter  on  title  in appeal. Till  then the direction was issued to grant renewal of the licence subject to the result in the appeal. When similar  matters have  come up,  this Court in two cases where  the title  of the  licences were  upheld by the primary authority but appeals are pending, had directed that pending disposal  of the  appeals, renewal  of the  licences under Salt Act would be granted subject to the result in the appeals. In other cases, this Court directed the respondents to make  application before  the competent Authority namely, the District  Collector who  was directed  to dispose of the application  whether   the  respondent   has  title  to  the property.     This  Court  also  directed  to  consider  the statutory vesting  of the  salt lands  in the State and also all other  relevant documents  that  may  be  filed  by  the respondents in  the adjudication.  A further  direction  was issued to  the appellant  to file the  objections before the original authority  was directed  to dispose  of the  matter after hearing parties within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of that order In this  case, the latter situation arises, namely, the respondents  had   not  filed  any  application  before  any authority to  establish their  title. It is settled law that the respondents  must be either the owner or the lessee from http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the owner to seek renewal of the licence. In view  of the  fact that  the  title  is  yet  to  be decided, the respondents are directed to make an application before the  District Collector.  The District  Collector  is directed to  enquire whether  the respondents  have title to the property taking into account the statutory vesting under the provisions  of the Act as also any other documents to be produced by  the respondents  or the State Government or the appellant, as  the case may be After hearing the parties and giving opportunity,  the matter will be disposed of within a period of  six months  from the  date of the receipt of this order Until  then, the   appellant  is directed to renew the licence under the Salt Act.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment and order dated 11.8.2003 passed by the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench, in Criminal Appeal No.486/1990. Four persons had filed the aforesaid appeal questioning their conviction for offences punishable under Sections 302, 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short ’IPC’). Though the Trial Court had recorded a conviction, the Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction.  It was noted that there were several discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses and the prosecution version did not inspire confidence. 3.      Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the approach of the High Court is not correct and the analysis of evidence suffers from various infirmities. 4.      At this juncture, it needs to be noted that the complainant Usman Ali had filed Criminal Appeal No.233 of 2004 before this Court questioning the correctness of the impugned judgment in the present appeal.  This Court by its judgment date 22.3.2006 allowed the appeal with the following observations: ""The evidence of these three eyewitnesses is corroborated by the medical evidence. The High Court has committed an error of record in observing that the injuries found on these witnesses are not consistent with the prosecution case rather from the injuries noted above, it would be clear that the prosecution case is supported by medical evidence. Further their evidence could not have been thrown out merely because they were family members rather they were most competent persons being the inmates of the house especially when the occurrence had taken place in the house itself in the dead of night.  This being the position, we do not find any reason to disbelieve their evidence.  In our view, the Trial Court was quite justified in placing reliance http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 upon the evidence of these three eye-witnesses and the High Court has committed error in rejecting the same. Lastly, the High Court has committed an error in recording acquittal also on the ground that the names of the recording acquittal also on the ground that the names of the accused persons were not mentioned in the inquest report. In our view, this hardly could be a ground to acquit the accused persons.  For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the Trial Court was quite justified in convicting the respondents and the judgment of acquittal rendered by the High Court suffers from the vice of perversity, as such the same is liable to be set aside. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed, impugned order of acquittal rendered by the High Court is set aside and convictions of the respondent recorded by the Trial Court are restored. Bail bonds of respondents, who are on bail, are cancelled and they are directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence for which compliance report must be sent to this Court within one month from the date of receipt of copy of order by the Trial Court."" 5.      In this view of the matter, nothing further survives to be done in the present appeal. However, had the parties brought to the notice of the Bench hearing Criminal Appeal No. 233/2004 about pendency of the present appeal, it could have been taken up simultaneously. Apparently, that was not done. 6.      The appeal is disposed of accordingly.","Four persons had filed the appeal questioning their conviction for offences punishable under Sections 302, 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

Goel, while working as Head the  Department of  Statistics in  MMD Degree  College, Modinagar  had   gone  on   foreign  assignment   in   Basra University, Iraq  for a  period of one year. Subsequently, a letter was  written by  the Managing Committee on August 20, 1979 seeking the third respondent to join duty. Since he did not  join   the  duty,   the  Managing  Committee  passed  a Resolution to hold an enquiry into unauthorised absence from duty. On  27.2.1980, a charge-sheet in the shape of a letter was sent  to respondent  No.3. He did not participate in the enquiry.  The   Enquiry  Officer  submitted  his  report  on 19.6.1980. The  Managing Committee,  on consideration of the report, dismissed  the third  respondent on 31.7.1980 stated that  since   the  third  respondent  had  gone  on  foreign assignment, with  the  approval  giving  by  the  appellant- Management, termination without giving an opportunity to the respondent to  join duty is not proper. Accordingly, a cable was sent to the third respondent university as under: ""ON 20.1.1981,  the University sent him a  cable on  his Basrah address and  had   also  sent   a  copy  in confirmation  of  the  above  cable that he  should join  M.M. College, Modi Nagar  (Ghaziabad) immediately and latest  by 15th  February, 1981 positively failing  which the Vice- Chancellor   will    approve    the termination  proceedings   in  this case."" Admittedly, the  third respondent, Dr.B.S. Goel did not join the  duty by  the prescribed time. Consequently, he was not taken  to the  duty when  he later  on reported for duty after coming  to India. He filed a writ petition in the High Court. The  High Court, in the impugned order, dated January 8, 1996,  in Writ  Petition No.9343/81,  has held that since the approval of termination was not given earlier, the Vice- Chancellor had  no power  to review  the  order  and  accord http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 sanction for termination by the proceedings dated 21.2.1981. We find  that the  view taken  by the High Court is not correct. The  approval sought  by the  appellant  for  third responden’s absence from service was after the expiry of the period of  foreign assignment.  Necessarily, he,  therefore, unauthorisedly remained  absent from  duty. Approval  by the Vice-Chancellor to  the dismissal of teacher from service is a pre-condition  and the Vice-Chancellor had passed on order with a  direction to  give further  opportunity for joining. Letter dated  15.2.1981 is  a  conditional  letter.  On  his failure to  join duty,  the approval  of the Vice-Chancellor stood accorded. Under these circumstance, the removal of the respondent from  service is  accordingly in  accordance with law. The appeal  is accordingly allowed. The judgment of the High Court  stands reversed. The writ petition dismissed. No costs.","Dr. B.S. Goel was dismissed from MMD Degree College, Modinagar. He had gone on assignment in Basra University, Iraq for a period of one year.

1432," JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5606 OF 2007 [Arising out of SLP (C) No. 17331 of 2006] Leave granted. The appellant was appointed in the year 1984 with the South Central Railway and was posted at Lalgude Loco-Shed, Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh.   On 15.10.1991, one C. M. Reddy, colleague of the appellant, abused him and uttered objectionable words regarding the character of his wife.  On this sudden provocation and insinuation, the appellant lost his cool and equanimity and slapped C. M. Reddy. Thereafter, a scuffle ensued, in which Constable Murali of the Railway Police Force had beaten Yard Khalashi Meekwin James, in order to save Constable C.M. Reddy.  Meckwin James tried to push them away and consequently they fell down and sustained injuries. The entire incident happened because of irresponsible behaviour of the appellant and Constable C.M. Reddy.  It is alleged by the respondents that the entire incident had lowered the reputation of the disciplined Railway Police Force. The departmental enquiry was conducted against them and both of them were found guilty.  The punishment of withholding of increment for a period of two years with cumulative effect on Constable C.M. Reddy was imposed and the appellant involved in the same incident, was punished with removal from the service.  The punishment of the appellant of removal the from service was maintained even by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, Bench at Aurangabad in Writ Petition No.1673 of 1993 The appellant, aggrieved by the imposition of extreme penalty of removal from the service, has approached this court. Undoubtedly, the appellant (being a member of a disciplined Force) had acted in a very irresponsible manner.  It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the conduct of the appellant must be seen in the background of the entire episode.  In the departmental enquiry, the appellant and Constable C.M. Reddy were found guilty.  The penalty of removal of the appellant from the service was maintained even before the Division Bench of the High Court. The appellant aggrieved by the impugned judgment has approached this court. This Court issued show cause notice to the respondents and in pursuance to that a counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the Divisional Security Commissioner, Railway Police http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Force, Hyderabad Division.  In para 4 of the said affidavit, it is incorporated that the entire incident was due to the irresponsible behaviour of the appellant and Constable C.M. Reddy.  But, in the departmental enquiry, Constable C.M. Reddy was imposed the punishment of withholding of increment for a period of two years with cumulative effect, whereas, the appellant was punished with removal from the service. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent, Union of India. On consideration of the peculiar facts and circumstance of this case, the extreme punishment of removal imposed on the appellant seems to be shockingly disproportionate to the level of misconduct on the part of the appellant, particularly when Constable C.M. Reddy, who was involved in the same incident, has been awarded much lesser punishment. The entire incident happened predominantly because of sudden and grave provocation by Constable C.M. Reddy on uttering abusive language and doubting the character of the appellant’s wife. In our considered opinion, the ends of justice would be met if the extreme penalty imposed on the appellant of removal from the service is set aside and, instead, the penalty of withholding of increment for a period of three years with cumulative effect is imposed on the appellant.   The appellant shall also not be entitled to any back wages. This appeal is accordingly disposed of.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, the parties are directed to bear their own costs.","The appellant was appointed in the year 1984 with the South Central Railway and was posted at Lalgude Loco-Shed, Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh.

1433," O R D E R It is  not is  dispute that  the truck of the appellant was seized  for non-payment  of the tax under Motor Vehicles Act and  he has still not discharged the liability. The only question is  whether the  State is  vicariously  liable  for damages for  seizure of  the vehicle. The trial court though found that  the seizure  was illegal  due to incompetency of the officer  to seize  the vehicle,  refused  to  grant  the relief  of   damages  on   the  ground  that  the  appellant contributed to the damages since there was neither a stay by any competent  court to  take delivery  of possession of the truck to the appellant nor the appellant made any attempt to take possession  of the  truck. On  appeal, the  High  Court reversed the  finding of  the incompetence of the officer to seize the  truck. It  found  that  the  police  officer  was competent in  law to  take possession of the vehicle for the purpose of  enforcing the  liability to  pay tax under Motor Vehicles Act.  It concurred  with contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. Thus this appeal by special leave against the  judgment and decree of the High Court of Bombay in Appeal No.301/69, dated 28.4.1977. In view of the admitted position that the appellant has not discharged  the liability to pay the tax, the obligation still subsists.  The seizure  for  enforcement  of  the  tax liability is,  therefore, valid in law. The finding that the appellant had  in fact  contributed for the damages suffered by him  due to  latches on  his  part,  namely,  neither  he attempted to  take possession  and there  is no  stay on the delivery of  the possession  nor make  use of the vehicle is also a finding of fact.

Out of six accused.  only three could  be put up for trial as Gurtej Singh.  Chamkaur Singh and Jagdev Singh  were found absconding and their presence could not be obtained at the trial.    In  fact  they  were  declared  as proclaimed offenders.  The trial court believed the evidence of  the prosecution witnesses and held that Gurtej Singh and the said murder was committed by them in  pursuance  of  the conspiracy  hatched  by them along with Hardev Singh, Pritam Kaur and  Paramjit  Kaur.    The  trial  court,   therefore, convicted  two  appellants and Paramjit kaur for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with  Section  120.B  IPC. All  the  three  appealed to the High Court and their appeal was dismissed. Hardev Singh and Pritam  Kaur  have  now  approached this  Court  challenging  their conviction. What is urged by the learned counsel for the appellants is that the  evidence led  by  the  prosecution to connect the appellants with the murder  of  Nachattar  Singh  is  really  insufficient  and, therefore,  their  conviction  under  Section  302 read with Section 120-B IPC is neither proper nor legal. As pointed out by the High Court, the  evidence  led by  the prosecution agianst the appellants was to the effect that they suspected that Nachatter Singh had killed Joginder Singh, father of appellant No. 1 and  husband  of  appellant No.2 and they wanted to take revenge. On one day in presence of Mukhtiar singh PW-4. Parminder Singh PW-5 and Avtar Singh PW-7  they  declared  that  they  would  take revenge. These witnesses  had  seen  Gurtej  Singh  in  the  house  of  the appellants  and  heard  him  assuring  appellant No.2 not to worry as they were going to show the result. We have gone through the evidence of these witnesses and we find that their  evidence  on  this  point  does  not appear  to  be  reliable.  Their passing by the house of the appellants at the time when  it  was  so  stated  is  rather difficult  to  be accepted. The High Court has not given any good reason for accepting that part of the evidence of these http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 witnesses. Merely from one occasion when prosecution witness Mukhtiar singh had seen Jagdev Singh and Gurtej singh in the house of the appellants. It was not proper to  jump  to  the conclusion  that  they  had gone there with a view to assure the appellants that they would take  revenge  by  committing murder  of  Joginder  Singh and the appellants had conspired with them for doing so. In our opinion the  prosecution  has failed  to  connect the appellants with the murder committed by Gurtej Singh and Chamkaur  Singh.  We,  therefore,  allow this  appeal  set aside the conviction of the appellants and acquit them of the charge levelled against them.","Out of six accused, only three could be put up for trial as Gurtej Singh.

The dispute between the parties relates to plot No. 66, admeasuring 45 ft. x 80 ft. total area 3600 sq.ft situated at Jawahar Nagar Extension Colony, Mauja Bhadeni Pargana Dehat, City Varanasi. As a dispute arose between petitioner and a cooperative society, the same was referred to arbitration. In the year 1981 an award was passed in favour of the petitioner. The arbitrator directed allotment of plot No. 6 in his favour. However, treating the said plot to be 66 (instead of plot No. 6) a sale deed was executed by the cooperative society in favour petitioner for plot No. 66. Another dispute arose between the respondent and the cooperative society in relation to award of a plot in her favour. In the award made in favour of the respondent, it was directed that any of the 3 plots namely, plot Nos. 66, 91 or 15 may be allotted in her favour. As the plot Nos. 91 and 15 were not available having been allotted to other members of the cooperative society, the respondent filed an execution application for allotment of the said plot No. 66 and execution of sale deed in her favour. In relation thereto, an objection filed by the petitioner herein has been dismissed. The revision petition filed thereagainst has also been dismissed. The sole question which arose for consideration before the executing authority was as to whether in view of the fact that a deed of sale has been executed in favour of the petitioner in respect of the said plot No. 66, the execution petition filed at the instance of the respondent was maintainable. Petitioner sought to rely upon the docrtine of lis pendens to contend that the said execution application was not maintainable. Before us copies of the original awards have been produced for the perusal. It appears that plot No. 6 was only directed to be allotted in favour of the petitioner. If in execution of the said award a sale deed in respect of plot No. 66 has been executed, the same was evidently done by mistake and, thus, the petitioner cannot take any advantage thereof. The remedy of the petitioner would, therefore, be to initiate an appropriate proceeding for giving effect to the award passed by the Arbitrator in his favour. The appeal is devoid of any merit and is, therefore, dismissed. No costs."," dispute between parties relates to plot No. 66, admeasuring 45 ft. x 80 ft. total area 3600 sq.ft situated at Jawahar Nagar Extension Colony, Mauja Bhadeni Pargana Dehat, City Varanasi.

1439," O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and  order  dated  July  18,  1979  made  in  Special  Civil Application  No.92/75   by  the   High  Court   of   Bombay. Notification under Section 4(1) acquiring an extent of about 5 acres  of land  was published  in  the  State  Gazette  on September 17,  1970 for public purpose, namely, construction of staff quarters for Maharashtra Road Transport Corporation employees. Declaration under Section 6 was published on July 29, 1971.  The award also was made on September 15, 1971. It would appear  that respondents 1-3 had purchased three plots of land  from Usmanshahi  Mills which  was under liquidation through the  Official Liquidator  on June  17, 1968. But the mutation of  their names  in the  revenue  records  was  not effected. In consequence, notices could not be issued. They, in turn,  sold these plots to 4th respondent in 1973. A writ petition was  filed on  December 19,  1974  challenging  the validity of  the notification  and also  the award. The High Court set  aside the notification on the ground that notices as required under law have not been served on respondents 1- 3. It is  seen that  Section 4(1)  does  not  require  the service of  the personal  notice nor the one under Section 6 declaration. What is needed to be served in the locality and the Gazette  which have  been complied  with. As regards the notices under Section 9 is concerned, it now transpires from the  revenue   records  that   the  original  owner  namely, Usmanshahi Mill  was served.  Since mutation  had  not  been effected in  the name  of respondents  1-3 though  purchased prior to the publication of notification under Section 4(1), they could  not be  issued notices as required under Section 9. Notice  to the  4th respondent  is obviously  impossible, since the award has already been made on September 15, 1971. His purchase  thereafter is obviously illegal as it does not bind the State after the notification under Section 4(1) was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 published. Under  these circumstances,  the High  Court  was wholly unjustified  in quashing  acquisition in  respect  of three plots of land of respondents 1-3. It is brought to our notice that after the notification was quashed  by the  High Court, no further steps were taken by the  Government. It  is not  necessary since  it is being challenged in  the appeal in respect of these three plots. A submission was made that the Corporation does not need these three plots. A submission was made that the Corporation does not need  these three  plots of  lands for the employees. So long as  there is  no notification  published under  Section 48(1) of the Act withdrawing from the acquisition, the Court cannot take  notice of  any subsequent disinclination on the part of the beneficiary. The appeal  is allowed  and the  writ  petition  stands dismissed. But, in the circumstances, without costs.","High Court set aside notification on the ground that notices as required under law have not been served on respondents 1-3.

Briefly stated the facts are as follows: On  9th September, 1996 the Appellant has been convicted and sentenced  for  offences  under Sections 198,  420  and  471 I.P.C.  on the ground that he knew that a Marksheet produced by  him  was  false  and still he used  that  Marksheet  for gaining  admission to Polytechnic Course in 1986.  The trial court  whilst convicting the Appellant has noted that it was not  proved  that  the  Marksheet had  been  forged  by  the Appellant.   The trial court, however, held that there was a possibility that the Appellant had either himself or through somebody  else  got the Marksheet amended.  The trial  Court found  that  the Appellant was aware that this was  not  the correct  Marksheet and had still used it to gain  admission. The  trial Court, therefore, convicted the Appellant as  set out  above.  The Sessions Court dismissed the Appeal of  the Appellant.   A  Revision was filed before the High Court  of Gujarat.  The High Court by the impugned Judgment refused to interfere.   It dismissed the Revision.  Hence this  Appeal. We  have heard the parties.  In our view it has been  proved beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that the  Appellant  used  the duplicate  certificate  with changes, as a true  certificate knowing  it  to be false in material particular and  thereby got admission.  Therefore we see no reason to interfere with the  conviction.   However  looking  to the  nature  of  the offence  and the fact that the Appellant’s past and  present records  has been good and the fact that he has already lost his career and is now married we reduce the sentence to that already  under gone.

1443," O R D E R This appeal  is treated as special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  arises from  the order  dated February 17, 1995 in  FA NO.510  of 1992  of the  National  Consumer  and Redressal Commission,  New Delhi.  The respondent-Haribandnu Setha filed  a claim  before the  State  Commission,  Orissa under the  Consumer Protection  Act, 1986  [for  short,  the ’Act’] for  damages. The  State Commission  awarded  damages against the  first respondent-LIC.  In appeal, the appellant was impleaded  as party-respondent  and the  National  Forum awarded damages against the State in a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- [Rupees one  lakh only]  and directed  to  pay  compensation within a  period of  three  months.  Thus,  this  appeal  by special leave. The only  question is:  whether the appellant is liable to pay  compensation to  Haribandhu Setha  under the Act and whether the  claim is maintainable. Section 2 [1] (o) of the Act defines ’services’ as under: ""’services’ means  service  of  any description which is made available to potential users and includes the provision    of    facilities    in connection with banking, financing, insurance,  transport,  processing, supply  of   electrical  or   other energy, board  of loading  or  both housing construction entertainment, amusement or  the purveying of news or other  information, but does not include  the   rendering   of   any service free  of charge  or under a contract of Personal service."" [emphasis supplied] http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 A reading  of the  definition would  indicate that  the services contemplated  thereunder  alone  are  the  services within the  meaning of  the  Act  except  excluded  services mentioned thereunder.  The excluded  services  are  ""service free of charge or under a contract of personal service"". The concept of  contract of personal service was considered in a recent judgment  of this Court in Indian Medical Association v. V.P.  Shantha &  Ors. [(1995)  6 SCC 651]. This Court had held therein  that the  expression ""personal  service"" has a well known  legal connotation  and has been construed in the context of  the right to seek enforcement of such a contract under the  Specific Relief Act. For that purpose, a contract of personal  service has been held to cover a civil servant, the managing  agents of  a company  and a  professor in  the University. There  can be  a contract of personal service if there is relationship of master and servant between a doctor and the  availing of  his services  and in  that  event  the services rendered  by the  doctor to  his employer  would be excluded from  the purview of the expression under Section 2 [1] (o)  of the  Act by virtue of the exclusionary clause in the said  definition. The  other excluded service is service rendered free of charge. It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  respondent  was  a Government servant  and,  therefore,  he  is  bound  by  the service conditions and the State was rendering services free of  charge   to  the   contesting  respondent.  Under  those circumstances, the Government servant has been excluded from the purview  of the  Act to  claim any  damages against  the State under  the Act. Therefore, if any claim arises for the contesting respondent,  it would be open to him to claim, in any other  forum, but  not under  the Act.  If the  claim is barred  by   limitation,  time   taken  during   the  entire proceedings shall stand excluded. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.-The petitioner has moved this Court under- art.  32 of the Constitution for the issuance of a  writ  of habeas  corpus,  he being under detention by  order  of  the District  Magistrate,  Burdwan, under sub-s.(1),  read  with sub-s.(2) of S. 3 of MISA (Maintenance of Internal  Security Act, 1971).  Various grounds, similar to those considered by us  in Bhut Nath Mate v. State of West Bengal(1), have  been http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 urged,  and our conclusions thereon are similar to those  we have already expressed in the other writ petitions. It is important to note that in the atlidavit-in-opposition, filed  on  behalf of the respondent we find a  statement  as under ""I  further state that it appears from the records that  the detenue  petitioner  is  a  man  of  desperate  habits   and dangerous  character and also prone to committing  theft  of underground telecommunication cable."" (1)  Writ  Petition No. 1456 of 1973; judgment delivered  on February 8, 1974. 314 This has been relied upon by the State as additional  ground in  ’Support  of  the detention, apart  from  the  theft  of cables,  recited in the detention order and repeated in  the counter  affidavit.   Counsel candidly ,admitted  that  this additional  circumstance  had been placed before  the  State Government  and  the  Advisory  board,  and  certainly   was before .the District Magistrate when he passed the detention order.  It is perfectly plain that the authorities have been influenced by the report ,of the police that the  petitioner was  ""a man of desperate habits and dangerous character  and also prone to committing theft of underground cables."" We do not regard ’desperate habits’ and ’dangerous Character’  .as anything but vague.  Apart from the vice of vagueness  which perhaps  may not matter so far as the satisfaction.  of  the authorities  is concerned, every desperate or dangerous  man cannot  be run down under s. 3 of the MISA.  Moreover,  this vital  yet  injurious dossier about the petitioner  has  not been communicated to him and opportunity afforded for making a   proper  representation  contra.

Appellants Versus Miss Asha Trilokbhai Shah etc.            ..... Respondents JUDGMENT R.M. Sahai, J. An important  question in  relation to  the adoption of infants from  orphanage or  ashrams by  foreign nationals is raised by  the appellants,  who claim  to be social workers. They  approached  the  High  Court,  invoked  its  appellate jurisdiction against the order passed by the District Judge, Rajkot, allowing  the application  filed by  Superintendent, Kathiawar Nirashrit Balashram as Power of Attorney holder of a Norwegian  couple under  Section 7  of the  Guardians  and Wards Act,  1890 and  appointing the Norwegian couple as the guardian of  the child  with certain conditions mentioned in the order.  By the  time the appeal came up for hearing, the law of adoption by foreign nationals was streamlined by this Court in  two decisions:  Lakshmi Kant  Pandey v.  Union  of India (1984)  2 SCR  795 and  Laxmi Kant  Pandey v. Union of India &  Anr. (1985)  Supp. 3  SCR 71.  The  learned  Single http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Judge, therefore,  after examining the conditions imposed by the District  Judge held  that the  guidelines laid  down by this Court  had been  scrupulously followed.  The order  was maintained in appeal as well. The  guidelines  laid  down  by  the  Court  are  quite exhaustive. What is urged is that they are not being carried out either  in letter or spirit. It is, therefore, necessary to reiterate  the guidelines  laid down by this Court in the case of  Lakshmi Kant  Pandey (supra)  and further  make  it clear that  whenever an  application is filed for permission to adopt  a child  by a foreign national then the guidelines would be  strictly  adhered  to.  The  authority  permitting adoption should  explain to  the biological  parent  of  the child about  the nature  and effect  of the adoption and the possible permanent  loss  of  contact  from  the  child.  In absence of  a  finding  that  the  authorised  officer  took precaution to  explain the  effect of  adoption  it  may  be rendered infirm.  This is  demonstrated by the facts of this case as  the Superintendent,  as holder of Power of Attorney of  the  Norwegian  couple,  became  the  applicant  and  as Superintendent of  the Ashram  gave the  child in  adoption. That was  not proper.  It was the duty of the Superintendent to have  contacted the  mother and  the father, if they were known, and  to explain to them the effect of adoption unless they were  not available.  However, we do not interfere with the orders  passed by  the courts  below, but  as  indicated above, the  guidelines have  to  be  enforced  strictly,  as violation of  the same  may not  only  render  the  adoption infirm, but  may  lead  to  proceeding  against  the  person infringing the same. The appeals  are thus  disposed of  by reiterating  the guidelines laid  down by  this Court  and stating  that  any violation of  these or  non-compliance may  lead to adoption being declared  invalid and  expose the persons concerned to strict action including prosecution.",Supreme Court of India upholds the adoption of a child by a Norwegian couple.

S.V.Deshpande, Adv. for the Respondent O R D E R The following Order of the Court delivered: The validity  of the  order dated  15th November,  1989 passed b the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court (Panaji Bench) Goa  in Criminal  Writ  Petition  No.27/89  is  under challenge in  this appeal.  On 24th  July, 1975  an order of detention under Section 3 (I) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and  Prevention of  Smuggling Activities  Act, 1974 was passed  against the step father of the respondent. It is an admitted  position  that  such  respondent  was  kept  on detention for  more than  a year but was released before the expiry of  two years.  On 20th  October, 1979  a notice  was issued to the respondent for forfeiture of the property held by the step father of the respondent under the provisions of the Smugglers  and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property)  Act, 1976.  No challenge was made against such notification  and  on  19th  December,  1985  the  competent authority under  the said  Act (hereinafter  referred to  as SAFEMA) passed order under Section 7 of the SAFEMA directing for forfeiture  of the property of the respondent. No appeal or writ  petition was  filed by  the respondent  challenging such forfeiture.  It may be stated that pursuant to the said order of  forfeiture the  property was  sold in  auction  in August, 1989  to the  Daman  Administration  for  a  sum  of Rs.2,59,256/- and  possession of  the said property had been handed over  the said  Daman Administration.  The respondent filed that  Criminal writ  petition No. 27.89 before the Goa Bench on  17th July, 1989 challenging the order of detention of her  step father.  The High  Court entertained  such writ petition and set aside the order of detention on the finding that the  grounds for  detention had  not been served on the detenue. Ms. A  Subhashini the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has  submitted that  the said writ petition should http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 not have been entertained by the High Court. After the order of forfeiture  had been  passed under SAFEMA validity of the order of  detention was  not be  scruitinised. In support of such contention,  she has referred to the nine judges’ Bench decision of  this Court  made in  Attorney General for India Ors. Vs.  Amratlal Prajivandas  and Ors.  (1994 (5) SCC 54). The ratio  of the decision had been summarised in para 56 of the said decision and it has been clearly indicated that 56.(b): An  order of  detention  to which Section 12-A is applicable as well as  an order  of detention  to which   Section    12-A   was   not applicable   can   serve   as   the foundation,  as   the  basis,   for applying SAFEMA  to such detenu and to  his  relatives  and  associates provided such  order  of  detention does not  attract any  of the  sub- clauses in  the proviso  to Section 2(2). If such detenu did not choose to  question   the  said  detention (either by  himself or  through his next  friend)   before  the   Court during the  period when  such order of detention was in force, -- or is unsuccessful in his attack thereon- he, or his relatives and associates cannot  attack   or  question   its validity when  it is made the basis for applying  SAFEMA to  him or  to his relatives or associates."" In view  of such  decision of  this  Court,  the  said  writ petition was  not maintainable. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order by allowing this appeal.","The validity of the order dated 15th November, 1989 passed b the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court (Panaji Bench) Goa is under challenge in this appeal. On 24th July, 1975  an order of detention under Section 3 (I) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 was passed against the step father of the respondent. On 20th October, 1979  a notice was issued to the respondent for forfeiture of the property held by the respondent under the provisions of the Smugglers  and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property)  Act, 1976. No challenge was made against such notification. On 19th December, 1985  the competent authority under the said Act (hereinafter  referred to  as SAFEMA) passed order under Section 7 of the SAFEMA directing for forfeiture  of property of respondent. No appeal or writ  petition was filed by  the respondent  challenging such forfeiture. pursuant to the said order of forfeiture the  property was sold in  auction  in August, 1989 to the  Daman  Administration for  a  sum of Rs.2,59,256/-.",appointment,20.7

It was stated that even counter affidavits had not been filed in these matters.  It was stated by the learned counsel for the appellants appearing in these matters  that several other questions were also raised which were not the subject matter of earlier group and were not agitated in those matters and were not answered one way or the other by the Court raised in these matters.  In all these matters, in our opinion, the abovesaid  fact also is not disputed by the learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondents.

1451," O R D E R We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner. We do not think  that it is a case warranting interference for the reason that  the appellate  authority had initially referred back the  matter to  the primary authority to reconsider the matter in  the light of the directions issued in that order. After  reconsideration,  the  confiscation  order  has  been passed in  respect of  the gold and in respect of two items, i.e. FAX  machine and  video camera  and compounding fee was ordered. On  appeal, it was confirmed and on revision it was also confirmed.  The petitioner filed a writ petition in the High Court.  The High  Court in  the  impugned  order  dated January 30,  1996 summarily  dismissed  the  writ  petition. Thus, this special leave petition. It is  contended by  learned counsel for the petitioner that the  petitioner is  entitled to cross-examine the Panch witnesses and  the Seizing  Officer for  the goods seized in contravention of  the FERA  & Customs  Duty Act and that the opportunity has  not been  given. Therefore, it is violative of natural justice. It is  true that  the petitioner  had confessed that he purchased the  gold had  brought it.  He  admitted  that  he purchased the  gold and  converted it  as a  Kara.  In  this situation, bringing  the  gold  without  permission  of  the authority is  in contravention  of the  Customs Duty Act and also FERA.  When the  petitioner seeks for cross-examination of the  witnesses who  have said  that the recovery was made from the  petitioner, necessarily an opportunity requires to be given  for the  cross-examination  of  the  witnesses  as regards the  place at  which   recovery was  made. Since the dispute concerns the  confiscation of the jewellery, whether at conveyor  belt or  at  the  green  channel,  perhaps  the witnesses were  required  to  be  called.  But  in  view  of confession made by him, it binds him and, therefore,  in the facts and circumstances of this case the failure to give him the opportunity  to cross-examine  the    witnesses  is  not violative of  principle of  natural justice. It is contended that the  petitioner had  retracted within six days from the confession. Therefore,  he is  entitled to cross-examine the panch witnesses  before the  authority takes  a decision  on http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 proof of  the offence.  We find no force in this contention. The  Customs   officials  are   not  police   officers.  The confession, though  retracted, is an admission and binds the petitioner. So  there is no need to call panch witnesses for examination and  cross-examination by the petitioner. It is  contended that  under  the  Rules  jewellery  is exempted articles. Kara being a symbol of the religious wear by the  Sikh community,  it is a jewellery exempted from the Act and  it cannot  be confiscated. In view of the admission that he had purchased gold, converted as Kara and brought as such, he  necessarily used it. Therefore, he is not entitled to the  benefit of  exemption. Under these circumstances, we do not  find any  illegality in  the  order  passed  by  the authority warranting interference. The Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.","We do not think  that it is a case warranting interference for the reason that  the appellate  authority had initially referred back the matter to the primary authority to reconsider the matter.

Though notice has been served on respondents 2 to 4, they have not chosen to enter appearance and contest these proceedings. Heard the counsel for appellant and first respondent. 2.      The Appellant herein, who was the complainant, filed a private complaint against Respondents 1 to 4 herein (Accused Nos. 1, 2, 4 & 5) and Accused No. 3 who is stated to have died during the pendency of the proceedings. The complainant alleged that the accused 2 to 5 who    were police constables came to his house, assaulted his wife and neighbours   and damaged the household articles; and that when he went to the police station to lodge a complaint, the Sub-Inspector (Accused No.1) assaulted him and subjected him to illegal detention. The learned Magistrate took cognizance and directed registration of a case against accused for offences punishable under section 448, 427, 341, 342, 354, 506(B) read with 34 IPC and ordered issue of summons. 3.      The first accused (D. Palakshiah) filed an application under section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code before the High Court to quash the proceedings on the ground that he was a public servant and the Magistrate was not justified in taking cognizance of the offences alleged against him as there was no sanction to prosecute him. His plea was accepted by the High Court. The High Court, instead of quashing the proceedings as against the first respondent herein, quashed the entire proceedings pending before the JMFC, Neelamangala, by the impugned order dated 6.9.2004. 4.       The contention of the appellant is that as Respondents 2 to 4 did not challenge the proceedings before JMFC and only the first accused approached the High Court, the High Court ought to have quashed the proceedings only in regard to first accused and not against all the accused. 5.      The offence alleged against Accused Nos. 2, 4 and 5 is different from the offence alleged against Accused No.1. Accused Nos. 2, 4 and 5 did not challenge the proceedings on the ground of want of sanction. Therefore, High Court ought not to have quashed the entire proceedings. 6.      In the result, we set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 so far as Accused Nos. 2, 4 and 5 are concerned.

Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 1368, Sector 10, Ambala City on 30th August, 1991.  He was, however, given the possession of the plot only on 27th September, 1996.  He therefore filed a complaint before the District Forum claiming interest at the rate of 24% on the amount of Rs.1,95,681.75 from the date he paid the amount till possession was given.  The District Forum held that 3 = years must be given to Appellants to give possession.  It was held that by 1st March, 1995 the Appellants should have handed over possession to the Respondent and that beyond that period they should pay interest at the rate of 18%.  The District Forum also directed payment of Rs.5,000/- as compensation for harassment and Rs.500/- as costs. In the Appeal filed by the Appellants, the State Commission reduced the interest from 18% to 15% per annum and set aside the award of compensation of Rs.5,000/-. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The National Commission has disposed off the Revision filed by the Appellants relying upon its own decision in the case of Haryana Urban Development Authority vs. Darsh Kumar. We are told that interest at the rate of 12% has been paid on 24th March, 2000.   It is not clear whether, whilst paying interest, any TDS has been deducted.  In our view, interest at the rate of !2% is sufficient in a case like this and, therefore, nothing further needs to be paid.  However, if TDS has been deducted, then the Appellants must, within 2 weeks from today, forward to the Respondent the amount of TDS deducted along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum thereon from the date it was so deducted till payment. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

1456," O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. The respondent-Surjeet  Singh was  a driver  of a heavy vehicle. He  was appointed on December 24, 1986. The Medical Board on  his examination  by  proceedings  dated  September 3,1993 found  that he  was suffering from Melineal Inter Cr. fractum resue/lant  by 5.2  un-c. Consequently,  the Medical Board opined that he could not perform the duties of a heavy vehicle  driver   due  to  the  above  disability.  Pursuant thereto, he was retired from service. He made an application for appointment  of his  son as  a  clerk  on  compassionate grounds on  the basis  of the  instructions  issued  by  the Government.  The   Government  on   consideration   of   his representation found  that the  respondent was neither blind nor nakara  (totally invalid)  on the date of his retirement and that,  therefore, he  is not entitled for appointment of his  son  on  compassionate  grounds  as  a  clerk.  Feeling aggrieved, he filed C.W.P. No.4088/95 in the High Court. The Division Bench  of the  Punjab & Haryana High Court by order dated August 29, 1995 held that the declaration of unfitness on medical  grounds, in  other words,  his invalidity in the service, attracts  the instructions issued by the Government dated August  28, 1992  and consequently  he is  entitled to have his  son appointed  on compassionate  grounds.  Calling that order  in question,  this  appeal  has  been  filed  by special leave. The only  question is  whether the  instructions of the Government dated  February  22,1991  read  with  intructions dated August 28, 1992 enable an employee having become blind or nakara during service and compulsory retired from service on account  thereof, to  be entitled  for appointment of his son  on   compassionate  grounds.   It  is   seen  that  the instructions do  clearly indicate  that an  employee who was compulsory retired from service should suffer from blindness or nakara  while in  service and  the compulsory  retirement http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 should follow due to the above factors. In this  case, it is seen that he was neither blind nor nakara on the date of the compulsory retirement. The doctors found  him   that  he   was  having   deficiency  in  sight. Consequently, he could not drive the heavy vehicle. It would not mean  that he  was totally  blind. Due  to disability in sight, which  is a pre-condition for safe driving of a heavy vehicle, he  was retired  from service and it would not mean that he  was totally  invalid or  blind. But we are informed that pursuant  to the  directions issued  by the High Court, the son  of the  respondent has  been appointed and he is in service. Under these circumstances, though we find that the view taken by the High Court is not correct in law, we decline to interfere with  the order.  However, the  order of  the High Court is  not to be taken   to be approved by this Court. On the other  hand, we  specifically hold  that the view of the High Court  is not  correct in  law. However,  we decline to interfere with the subsequent order passed by the appellant- State pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.

Similarly,  the  appellant  also  filed  the  writ petition. Both  the writ petitions came to have been decided on  different   dates.  The  write  petition  filed  by  the respondent-institution had  come up  in the  first  instance where the  learned single judge, while maintaining the order of reinstatement,  ordered reducing  the back-wages  to 25%.

1458," O R D E R This special leave petition arises from the judgment of the Division  Bench  of  the  Kerala  High  Court,  made  on February 9, 1996, in O.P. No.5382/83. The  admitted   position  is  that  Notification  under Section 4(1)  of the  Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the ""Act""),  which is  pari materia  with Section  3 of  the Kerala Land  Acquisition Act,  was published  on January 10, 1981. The  petitioner has initially challenged the scheme in O.P. No.2436/82  which was  dismissed and  was confirmed  in Writ Appeal  No.223/82, dated April 23, 1982. The petitioner filed another  writ petition  in the  year 1993  and got the further proceeding  stayed. The  same has  been dismissed by the High  Court by  the impugned  order. Thus  this  special leave. It  is   contended  for  the  petitioner  that  when  a notification under  Section 48  of the  Act withdrawing  the earlier notification  in respect  of some  of the  lands was issued, the  integrality of the notification stood disturbed and, therefore,  the acquisition  has become  bad in law. In support  thereof,  Shri  Sukumar,  learned  senior  counsel, sought to  place reliance on the judgments of Andhra Pradesh High Court and Kerala High Court which are inconsistent with each other.  He states that as there is conflict of opinions the conflict  needs to  be resolved. We find no force in the contention since  the controversy  has already  been set  at naught by  this court  in Chandra  Bansi Singh  v. State  of Bihar [  A.I.R. 1984 SC 1767] and  The Spl. Land Acquisition Officer, Bombay  v. M/s.  Godrej &  Boyce  [A.I.R.  1987  SC 2421]. Therefore,  merely because  some of  the lands  which formed part  of the  same notification  were  denotified  in exercise of  the power  under Section  48 of  the  Act,  the integrality of  the notification  for   acquisition has  not become bad in law. It is  then contended  that due  to the  delay  in  the disposal  of  the  matters  the  prices  of  the  land  have escalated and  as a  consequence, the acquisition has become bad in  law. We  find no force in the contention. In support of  this  contention,  learned  counsel  relied  upon  those judgments of  this Court where equities have been worked out http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 in directing payment of higher compensation from the date of the publication of the declaration under Section 6. In those cases the  State was responsible for the delay. In this case it is  not responsible  for the delay in finalisation of the acquisition. On  the other  hand, the petitioner has himself put the spokes at every stage and have the matter delayed by agitating his right in judicial proceedings. The pendency of the judicial proceedings cannot be made a ground to say that in the  process,  due  to  escalation  in  the  prices,  the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act has become bad in  law.

1460," W I T H C.M.P. NO.3 910 OF 1986. O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment dated August 30, 1979 of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court  in C.M.W. No.35/1977. Notification under Section 4(1) of  the Land  Acquisition Act,  1894 [for  short,  ‘the Act’] was  published in  the Gazette  on September 29, 1976. Declaration under  Section 6 was made on September 30, 1976. While issuing  the notification  under Section  4(1) of  the Act, the  Government exercised the power under Section 17(4) of the Act and dispensed with the September 1976. Therefore, the appellants  should be compensated by payment of interest @ 12  per cent  per annum.  In support of his contention, he placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Ram Chand & Ors. vs.  Union of  India &  Ors. [(1994)  1 SCC  44] and in particular on  paragraph 16 of the judgment. It is seen that in Ram  Chander’s case  even after the dismissal of the writ petitions by  this Court  in Aflatoon  vs. Lt.  Governor  of Delhi [(1975)  4 SCC  285], no  action was taken by the Land Acquisition Officer to pass the award. Thus, till 1980-81 no award was  made in respect of any of the acquisitions. Under these circumstances,  this Court had directed the Government to pay  interest @  12 per  cent on  the amount  awarded  to compensate the  loss caused  to the  appellants therein.  In this case,  it is  seen that  though  the  notification  was issued in  September 1976,  the writ  petitions came  to  be filed in  the High  Court immediately  thereafter in 1977 in the  High  Court  and  obviously  further  proceedings  were stayed. Accordingly,  the Land  Acquisition Officer  delayed the award.  After the  dismissal of  the writ petitions, the appellants came  to this  Court  and  obtained  status  quo. Obviously,  the  Land  Acquisition  Officer  was  not  in  a position to pass the award immediately. Thereafter, it would http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appear that  he passed  the award on March 22, 1983. Section 34 of  the Act  obligates the State to pay interest from the date of  taking possession  under the  unamended Act @ 6 per cent and  after the  Amendment Act  68 of  1984 at different rates mentioned  therein. The  liability of the State to pay interest ceases  with the  deposit made as per Section 34 of the Act.  Further liability  would arise only when the court on reference  under Section  18  enhances  the  compensation under Section  28 of  the Act. Similarly, in an appeal under Section 54  of  the  Act  if  the  appellate  court  further increases the  compensation, then  again similar  obligation under Section 28 arises. In  the  light  of  the  operation  of  the  respective provisions of  Sections 34  and 28  of the  Act, it would be difficult to direct payment of interest. In fact, Section 23 (1-A) is  a set  off for  loss in cases of delayed awards to compensate the  person  entitled  to  receive  compensation; otherwise a  person who  is responsible  for  the  delay  in disposal of the acquisition proceedings will be paid premium for dilatory  tactics. It  is stated  by the learned counsel for the  respondents that  the amount  of interest  was also calculated and  total amount was deposited in the account of the appellants by the Land Acquisition Officer after passing the  award,   i.e.,  on  November  15,  1976  in  a  sum  of Rs.20,48,615/-. Under  these circumstances, the liability to pay interest  would arise  when possession  of the  acquired land was  taken and the amount was not deposited. In view of the fact  that compensation  was deposited  as soon  as  the award was  passed, we  do not think that it is a case for us to interfere at this stage. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment dated August 30, 1979 of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in C.M.W. No.35/1977.

Not feeling satisfied with the relief, the respondent filed writ petition claiming the pension  from date  of his-application.

We are, therefore, of the  opinion   that  there   is   a distinction  between  the  decision relied on by the learned Additional Solicitor  general   on   decisions relied on by the respondent.

In view of the above settled legal position, though the respondent was  not entitled  to the  pension as  a freedom- fighter, he  was given the relief on the basis of benefit of doubt.

1462," O R D E R B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J. I agree  respectfully with  the opinion  prepared by my learned brother K.S. Paripooran, J. Looking  at  the  provisions  of  the  Sick  Industrial Companies (Special  Provisions) Act,  1985 [ the Act], I was wondering how  out of  tune the  Act  has  become  with  the economic policies  being pursued  now in this country. Since 1991-92, we  are launched  upon,  what  is    being  called, liberalisation of  our economy.  We have given up the policy of protecting  our industries against foreign competition on the ground  that it  has given  rise to  an inefficient  and outdated industrial  system in  our country.  Our industries are suddenly  being asked to compete with foreign companies, many of whom being giant multi-nationals have vast resources at their  disposal. They  are merrily  gobbling up  our poor native companies. Many local industries, unable to stand the said competition  are joining the foreign giants in one form of venture  or other.  Several hundreds  of small-scale  and medium scale  units in  telecom sector,  for  example,  have suffered  enormously   because  of   our  love  for  foreign companies and  their capital.  The state  of several  public sector companies  is no better. I am not saying that we have totally  embraced,   what  may   be  called  ""Reaganism""  or ""Thatcherism"". The  fact, however,  remains that  it  is  no longer thought  advisable  to  keep  alive  inefficient  and uneconomic industries  by injecting  public funds  or in the name of safeguarding the employment of the workers. And here is this  Act, a  product of the era of protectionism seeking to keep  alive ""sick"" companies by pumping in funds - mostly public funds  - and by providing various concessions. In the process, nobody enquires why a particular industrial company has become  sick, viz.,  whether it  is an  induced  one  or whether it  is on  account of  factors beyond their control. The object  of the  Act is undoubtedly laudatory but it must also  provide   for  appropriate   measures  against  person responsible where  it is  found that  sickness is  caused by factors other  than circumstances  beyond the control of the management.  It   is  also   a  well-known   fact  that  the proceedings before  the Board  of Industrial  and  Financial http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Reconstruction take  a long  time to  conclude and  all  the while the protective umbrella of Section 22 is held over the company which  has reported  sick. We have come across cases where  unfair  advantage  is  sought  to  be  taken  of  the provisions of  Section 22  by certain industrial companies - and the  wide language  employed in the section is providing them a  cover. We are sure section 22 was not meant to breed dishonesty nor  can it be so operated as to encourage unfair practices. The  ultimate prejudice  to public  monies should not be  overlooked in  the process  of promoting  industrial progress. We  are quite  sure that  the Government  is fully alive to  the situation  and are  equally certain  that they must be  thinking of  necessary modifications  in  the  Act. These few  observations are  meant merely to record the need for changes in the Act.","Since 1991-92, we have given up the policy of protecting  our industries against foreign competition.

NO.241/85 Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (for short, ‘the Act’) was published in the Union Gazette on  February 21,  1973. The  Collector in  his award dated May  25, 1974 determined the compensation @ Rs.4,280/- per Bigha  rounded to  Rs.50/- per  sq. yd.  The  Additional Judge by   his  award  and  decree  dated  August  8,  1978, enhanced the  compensation to Rs.6,420/- per bigha. The High Court further  enhanced it  in appeal by judgment and decree dated  July   10,  1984  to  Rs.12,000/-  per  bigha.  Still dissatisfied therewith,  the appellants filed this appeal by special leave. Shri P.P.  Juneja, learned  counsel appearing  for  the appellants contends  that this  Court in  Gokal vs. State of Haryana [(1992)  Supp 2 SCC 69] had taken judicial notice of constant rise  in the  prices and  fixed the market value at different rates  depending upon the year of acquisition. The appellants’ lands  are also  situated within the master plan of the  Delhi Development  Authority. They are also entitled to compensation  @ Rs.13  per sq.  yd. In  Jailal & Ors. vs. Union of  India C.A. No.830/81 decided on February 23, 1981, this Court  found that  the  market-value  of  Nangal  Dewat notified under  Section 4(1)  published on  December 3, 1971 would fetch @ Rs.13/- per sq. yd. Having given consideration to the pursuasive arguments of Mr.  P.P. Juneja,  we think it is difficult to accept the contention. It  is  seen  that  for  the  lands  in  Shahbad Mohammeddpur village  which is now part of the lands in this case, compensation  was determined  @ Rs.12/-  per sq.  yd., i.e.,Rs.12,000/- per  bigha. The  lands are claimed to be on par with  the lands  in Nangal  Dewat. But when the lands in the entire  village has  been determined  at Rs.12/- per sq. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 yd., we  do not  think we  would  be  justified  in  further increasing the compensation to the appellants’ lands on mere pursuing the remedy by way of appeal.

The   short  question  that  arises  for decision of  this Court is whether the land where systematic teak plantation  is not  natural one,  will be exempted from the purview  of private  forests under  the  Kerala  Private Forests (Vesting  and Assignment) Act, 1971. It appears that under  Section  2  of  the  said  Act,  unless  the  context otherwise requires,  the private forest means in relation to Malabar District referred to in sub-section  (2)  of Section 5 of  the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, any land to which the Madras Preservation of Private Forests Act, 1949 applied to the  lands in  question immediately  before the appointed day.  But  certain  lands  have    been  excluded  from  the definition of  Private Forests  under  the  Kerala  Act  and Clause (C)  of sub-section  (2) (1)  (F) is relevant for our consideration. Clause  (C)  contains  that  when  lands  are principally cultivated  with cashew  or other  fruit-bearing trees  or   are  principally   cultivated  with   any  other agricultural crop  will be  exempted  from  the  purview  of private forests under the Kerala act. Mr.Iyer, the  learned senior  counsel appearing for the appellants contended that Clause (C) exempts not only cashew or other  fruit bearing  trees but also any other land which are principally  used for  cultivation of agricultural crop. In the  instant case,  the teak has been grown by systematic human efforts  and it is not a case of natural growth of the forest. Hence,  such land  must  be  held  to  be  the  land principally cultivated  with agricultural  crop.  Therefore, such land  will be  exempted from  the  purview  of  private forests within the meaning of said Kerala Act. We are,  however, unable  to accept  such submission of the learned  counsel. Every  agricultural activity  has  not been exempted  under the said Kerala Act and Clause (C) only protects lands  which are principally cultivated with cashew or fruit  bearing  trees  and  principally  cultivated  with ’agricultural   crop’.   Agricultural   crop   as   commonly understood does  not convey   the  agricultural activity  in teak plantation.  Therefore, such activity cannot be brought http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 within the purview of the said Clause (C). The learned  counsel for  the respondents has drawn our attention to a decision of this Court in Gwalior Rayons Silk Mfg. (Wvg.)  Co.  Ltd.  Vs.  Custodian  of  Vested  Forests, Palghat and  another   (1990 (Suppl.)  SCC 785). In the said case, the  question of  vesting as  forest lands  in Malabar District  which   was  initially   governed  by  the  Madras Preservation of  Private Forests  act,  1949  prior  to  the Reorganisation of States was taken into consideration in the context of  applicability of  Kerala Forest Act. In the said cases, agricultural activity in growing Eucaliptus trees was considered. It  has been  held  that  the  land  where  such agricultural activity was held will not be exempted from the purview of  the said  Forest Act in Kerala under Clause (C). The ratio  of the said decision of this Court applies in the facts of  this case. Therefore, we do not find any reason to interfere with  the impugned decision of the High Court. The appeal , therefore, fails and is dismissed but there will be no order as to costs.","This appeal  arises out of the  leave granted  by the Kerala High Court by order  dated  January  12, 1984 in M.F.A.No.338/1978.

This  may  be followed  until the matter is carried  to  the High Court in some case, so that the confusion created  by  the Orissa  High  Court  decision reported  in All India Reporter  1951  Orissa, page 40 might be set at rest."" This endorsement bears the signature of the appellant. After  the  attention  of the High Court was  drawn  to  the aforesaid  endorsement  it caused notices to be  issued  not only to the Under Secretary to the Board of Revenue but also to  the Legal Remembrancer of Orissa to show cause way  they should  not be committed for contempt., Both of them  showed cause.   The High Court absolved the Legal Remembrancer  but convicted  the  appellant  and admonished  him,  as  already stated.  It may be mentioned that both of them had  tendered apologies  to  the High Court.  Even so, we think  that  the appellant was rightly found guilty of contempt of court  and admonished  as  well  as required to pay the  costs  of  the proceedings. The point on which the opinion of the Legal Remembrancer was sought  was whether a Magistrate authorised by the  District Magistrate to take cognisance of offences under s. 190, Code of  Criminal  Procedure,  can be regarded  as  a  Magistrate authorised by the District Magistrate as contemplated by  s. 20  of the Cattle Trespass Act.  In the case referred to  in the endorsement of the appellant, the Orissa High Court  had taken  the  view following the decision in  Raghu  Singh  v. Abdul  Wahab  (1)  that  authorisation  is  necessary.   The decision in Raghu Singh v. Abdul Wahab (1) was (1)  (1896) I.L.R. 23,Cal. 442. 328 dissented  from  in Budhan Mahto v. Issur Singh (1)  and  it does not appear that this fact was brought to the notice  of the  Orissa High Court.  The Legal Remembrancer to whom  the matter was referred submitted a note which, according to the High  Court, was ""something ambiguous and did not deal  with all  questions--consequential and ancillary"".  In  spite  of that the appellant, in his endorsement, gave a direction  to the  Magistrates  to ignore the decision of the  High  Court even though that was binding on them.  We have not the least doubt that such a direction is a flagrant interference  with the administration of justice by courts and a clear contempt of court.  Upon this view we dismiss the appeal.

As  regards  the  sentence, we regret  to  observe  that despite  having found no merits in the appeal the High Court should  have  interfere  with the quantum  by  reducing  the sentence  to  three years merely for the reason of lapse  of time  due  to  pendency  of proceedings  at  various  stages particularly,  High  Court awaiting disposal of the  appeal. In  the  facts  of the matter under consideration  when  the offence  charged is a serious one against an helpless  woman by  committing  a social evil, the question of  showing  any further  leniency to the accused does not and cannot  arise. The reduction of sentence thus made by the High Court of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 sentence imposed by the Trial Court which itself is found to be on the lenient side, stands set aside and quashed and the sentence  imposed  by the trial court stands restored.   The Authorities  will  take  steps to ensure  that  the  accused undergoes the balance of sentence.","The High Court had reduced the sentence to three years imprisonment on the ground that the occurrence is of the year 1983 and the same is sufficient to meet the ends of justice.

On 12.12.2005, an FIR was registered at Turkaulia P.S., District East Champaran, Bihar on the basis of a complaint lodged by Vinay Kumar Sharma.   As per the said FIR, at about 1 o’clock in the afternoon he along with his brothers and nephew Ajay Sharma reached the land which belongs to his family.   After some time, the accused-appellants, namely, Abdul Gaffar, Abdul Khair, Banaras Rai with other accused persons named in the FIR along with 150 people reached the fields where the complainant party was present, with arms and ammunition. Manan Dewan and Alauddin Dewan ordered their men to kill the complainant and his family members.  On this, Azhar Sah fired with a country-made pistol, which struck on the head of the complainant.  Then Abdul Gaffar, Abdul Khair and Banaras Rai gave beatings to Ajay Sharma, nephew of the complainant with an iron rod and a lathi, which ultimately resulted in his succumbing to the injuries sustained by him.  The FIR further alleged the participation of Abdul Khair of having caused injury to Loknath Sharma, brother of the complainant, with an iron rod. 3.              As per the appellants, they are the owners of the lands measuring 75 bighas in village Chilrawan, District East Champaran, Bihar, as these lands were part of the land settled by Betia Raj with the ancestors of the appellants and they had mortgaged the property in the year 1915.  After the period of 60 years,  under the Bihar Money Lenders Act, the said lands would revert back to the appellants and their family members.  It is a bone of contention of the appellants that on the relevant date they were in possession of the property and it was the complainant party which had tried to take forcible possession over the land and that is how the incident took place in which five members of the appellants’ family were shot dead and several others, namely, Alauddin, Mohd. Siraj, Banaras Rai, Zainuddin Sah, Abdul Ghaffar and Narayan Roy were badly injured by use of firearms.   The appellants contend that they had informed the police on 12.12.2005 itself that the Sharma brothers including the District Judge who is one of the brothers had planned to take over possession of the property and had threatened to kill the appellants like birds. 4.              It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the appellants have been falsely implicated as the other party was the attackers and in the process of their attack five persons  died and a number of other persons were seriously injured. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 5.              On a plain reading of the FIR which was lodged on the same day, i.e. on 12.12.2005, it is apparent that the accused-appellants were named as the persons who had caused serious injuries to Ajay Sharma, nephew of the complainant, who later on succumbed to injuries.  When the appellants have been named in the FIR which was lodged immediately after the incident, at this stage we do not find any infirmity in the impugned order of the High Court and that of the Sessions Court whereunder the accused-appellants were not released on bail. 6.              For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merit in the appeal.  It is, accordingly, dismissed.","Five members of the appellants’ family were shot dead and several others, namely, Alauddin, Mohd.

Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case the Respondent was allotted a commercial plot bearing No. 1359, Sector 21-D, Faridabad.     As possession was not given even though all amount had been deposited, the District Forum directed allotment of an alternate plot No. 216, Sector 31, Faridabad at the same rate at which the original plot was allotted.  The District Forum also directed payment of Rs. 10,000/- as escalation in cost of construction and on account of mental agony and harassment.  It also directed payment of interest on the amounts deposited at the rate of 18% per annum. The State Commission maintained the order of the District Forum, except that it waived award of Rs.10,000/- and also reduced the rate of interest to 10%. The National Commission dismissed the Revision filed by the Appellants on the ground that the State Commission had been very lenient. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In our view, the Order of the State Commission is just and proper and the National Commission was right in not interfering with it.  We also see no reason to interfere. It could not be stated whether interest as awarded has been paid or not and whether possession has been delivered.   The Appellants are directed to deliver possession within a fortnight from today, if not already delivered.  If the amount of interest has not been paid in spite of clarification given by this Court’s Order (reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65), we feel that for this lapse the Appellants must pay interest at the rate of 15% from 17th March, 2004 till payment.   Appellants shall also pay costs fixed at Rs.500/- to the Legal Aid Society of the Supreme Court.  The Appellants must recover the costs of Rs.500/- personally from the officer/s, who was responsible for not paying even after clarification by this Court. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases. With the above directions, the Appeal stands disposed of.",Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

1471," CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No. 169 of 1968. Application for restoration of Special Leave Petition. Parmod Swarup for the petitioner. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.  The  special  leave  petition  had  been http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 dismissed  on  an  earlier occasion on the  score  that  the petitioners had not surrendered to judicial custody which is more  or less a condition precedent to seeking the leave  of this  Court  to file an appeal.   However,  the  petitioners point  out,  in  the present  petition  for  restoration  of S.L.P.,  that  although they had offered  their  person  and surrendered before the, Assistant Sessions Judge, Madhipure, requesting that they be remanded to jail custody, the  court declined  to take them into custody for want of  receipt  of judgment from the High Court.  Prima facie, this appears  to be  true  in  view  of annexure A which is  a  copy  of  the application put into that court. It is unfortunate that when High Courts deliver judgments confirming the conviction  and sentence, there is a long delay in communicating the fact of affirmation of the sentence to the trial courts. 603 A  sentence  should  not be delayer at  least  after  it  is confirmed by the High Court but when this happens on account of  the indifference of the administrative side of the  High Court  in  the mechanical process of  communication  to  the trial  court it speaks badly of the management side  of  our court system.  We wish that more business-like procedures in such  matters were evolved so that the rule of law need  not suffer  a  new  shock  on  account  of  messy-management  of judicial  business rectifiable by a little more  promptitude and attention. These  observations  have  relevance  to  the  present  case because,  long after the judgment of the High Court and  the sentences  offering to surrender, the court’s  sentence  has not started to operate and the S.L.P. in this Court has  had to  be dismissed-things which should not have and could  not have  happened if the High Court’s administrative  side  had been less indifferent. The petition is allowed and the S.L.P. will be posted  three weeks later.   Time   to  surrender  ten  days.

1472," O R D E R Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties. The respondent  was a  driver in  the  service  of  the Punjab Roadways,  Jallandhar. There  was an  accident to the bus he  was driving  on 2.7.86.  Number of  passengers  were injured and the bus damaged. A F.I.R. WAS issued against the respondent under  Section 304-A  of the  I.P.C. and  certain other provisions.  He was  also suspended pending inquiry. A memo of  charges was  issued to  him  proposing  to  hold  a disciplinary inquiry  on the  charges of causing loss to the Corporation by  driving the  bus rashly  and negligently. An Inquiry Officer,  Shri R.S. Sharma, was appointed. White the proceedings were  pending before  the Inquiry  Officer,  the Criminal Court  acquitted the  respondent under its judgment and order  dated 19.10.1988.  After perusing the judgment of the Criminal Court, a fresh disciplinary inquiry was ordered against the respondent for which purpose a different Inquiry Officer  was   appointed.  The   disciplinary  inquiry   was accordingly held  and on  the basis  of the  report  of  the Inquiry Officer  the respondent  was  found  guilty  of  the charges and dismissed from service. The respondent  instituted a  suit in the Court of Sub- Judge, Jallandhar  for  a  declaration  that  the  order  of dismissal  was   void  and  illegal  and  for  consequential benefits. The  learned Subordinate  Judge dismissed the suit but  in   appeal  the  learned  District  Judge  upheld  the respondent’s claim.  The order  of  dismissal  was  declared illegal and  the respondent  was held  entitled to  all  the benefits flowing  from such  declaration. The  second appeal preferred by  the Corporation  and the  State of  Punjab was dismissed in limine by the High Court. The main  ground upon  which the learned District Judge has decreed  the respondent’s  suit is  that inasmuch as the first Inquiry  Officer (Shri  R.S.Sharma) had  submitted his report  which   report  was   also  acted  upon,  no  second disciplinary inquiry  could have  been ordered, particularly after acquittal  by the  Criminal Court.  We called upon the learned counsel  for the respondent before us to show us the evidence or the material on the basis of which the Appellate http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court has  held that the first Inquiry Officer had submitted his report  after the  conclusion of the inquiry and that it was also  acted upon.  We also  asked the learned counsel to clarify that  do the  words  ""the  inquiry  report  of  Shri R.S.Sharma has  been acted  upon  under  Rule  9.1""  in  the Judgment of  the learned  District Judge,  mean. The learned counsel for  the respondent  is  unable  to  point  out  any evidence or  explain the  said observation.  Indeed  in  the written submissions  filed  by  the  learned  counsel,  Shri U.S.Prasad, it  is stated  ""in all fairness I must point out to your Lordships that Inquiry Report and order imposing the punishment is  not available"".  The basis of the judgment of the first Appellate Court thus becomes untenable. We are,  however, not inclined to dispose of the matter finally at  this stage.  We have  not been shown the copy of the judgment  and order of the Criminal Court acquitting the respondent. We  have also  not been  shown  the  proceedings ordering the fresh inquiry or the reasons in which the fresh disciplinary inquiry was ordered, after the acquittal of the Criminal  Court.   These   matters   may   require   further examination. Accordingly  we allow  the appeal and set aside the judgment  of the High Court to request the High Court to admit the  second appeal  preferred by  the appellants’  and dispose it of on merits in accordance with law.","A F.I.R. was issued against the respondent under Section 304-A of the I.P.C. and  certain other provisions.

At  the  very start we put to the counsel how certificate could have  been http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 granted in this case when the judgment and order of the High Court  were not final.  The counsel brought to  our  notice the case of Ramesh and another v. Gendalal Motilal Ratni and others(1) and says that his, case is covered by this ruling. This was a case in which the only question to be  considered was  whether Art. 133 of the Constitution was applicable  in the  two case-, decided when the claim in the original  suit or  appeal  to  this Court was  above  Rs.  20,000/-.   This particular  question  was  not  before  the  court  at  all. Indeed,  them  Constitution contemplates the  filing  of  an appeal by certificate only (1)  A.I.R. 1966 S.C. 1445. 406 against  a judgment decree or final order of the High  Court it does not contemplate bringing an appeal in a suit  which is still a live suit and in which further proceedings are to be  taken.   This has been the consistent view not  only  of this Court but also of the Privy Council.  ’Me leading  case from  the Privy Council is V. M. Abdul Rahman and others  v. V. D. K. Cassim and Sons and another(1).  There is a  catena of cases in the High Courts and also in this Court that  the judgment,  decree or order from which appeal is  brought  to this  Court  must put an end to the litigation  between  the parties.  This was reaffirmed in M/s.  Jethanand and Sons v. The  State of Uttar Pradesh (2 ) approving the view  of  the Privy  Council referred to.  Indeed, we could cite  on  this aspect  of the case quite a large number of precedents  from various  courts in India.  In the present matter,  the  suit was  decreed in the absence of the defendant who applied  to have  the  decree set aside and gave reasons  for  it.   The trial court did not accede to the prayer but the High  Court held  that the matter was governed by O. 9 r. 9 of the  Code of  Civil  Procedure and that there were valid  reasons  for setting  aside  the  ex-parte decree.

Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The appellant-assessee is a company engaged in the business of civil construction.  It claimed for deduction under Section 32AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which was raised as an additional ground before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Tribunal’).  In paragraphs 19-21 of its order dated 20.6.2002 the Tribunal has rejected the claim of the assessee on two grounds.  The first ground is that the assessee was engaged in the business of civil construction and was not carrying on any manufacturing activity.  Hence, the claim was not allowable in view of the judgment of this Court in CIT v. N.C. Budharaja & Co., (1993) 204 ITR 412.  The second ground for rejecting the claim was that the claim was not based on facts on record.  The deduction under Section 32AB was not automatic and was subject to various conditions laid down in that provision.  Whether the assessee fulfilled those conditions for claiming the deduction or not required examination into facts which were not on record.  Even before the Tribunal the assessee had not placed any material to show how the assessee is entitled to such deduction.  Hence the Tribunal rejected the assessee’s claim.  By the impugned judgment the High Court has agreed with the view of the Tribunal. We have also carefully considered the matter and we are fully in agreement with the Tribunal as well as the High Court. For both the reasons mentioned by the Tribunal in paragraphs 19-21 of its order, we are of the opinion that the assessee was not entitled to the deduction claimed by it.  There is, thus, no merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed.","This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment dated 23.7.2004 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in ITA Nos. 8-9 of 2003.

The admitted  position   is  that  the  Commission  having  been entrusted with  the constitutional  duty to  select suitable candidates by  inviting applications  from the  open market, every  candidate   has   a   fundamental   right   to   seek consideration and  for selection  through open  competition. The petitioners  also have  that right.  At one  time,  they staked their  claims but  were not  selected. Therefore, the process of  recruitment through the Commission, as envisaged under  the  Constitution,  cannot  be  bypassed  by  issuing direction for  regularisation of  the services of the ad hoc persons who had come to the service through back-door entry. This Court  in  catena  of  decisions  has  deprecated  this practice of regularisation except in extra-ordinary cases by directing the  Government to  frame a  scheme and regularise Class III  and IV  services in  accordance with  the scheme. Even in  subsequent decisions,  that leverage  is not  being insisted upon. This Court in J & K Public Service Commission http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 & Ors.  vs. Dr.  Narinder Mohan  & Ors.  [(1994) SCC (L & S) 723] had  held that the Court cannot adopt hybrid process of direction to  regularise the  services bypassing  process of selection envisaged  under the  Constitution. This Court has deprecated the  Government for  exercising the  power  under Article 320  of the  Constitution taking  out the posts from the purview  of the Commission and to regularise services de hors the  Commission. Under  those circumstances,  we are of the view that the Tribunal has rightly rejected the claim to grant the relief sought for. The special  leave petitions  are accordingly dismissed subject to  the benefit  of relaxation  of age  bar till the date of  next recruitment so as to consider the cases of the petitioners along with open candidates.","The special leave petitions arise from the orders of the Administrative Tribunal made on February 20, 1996 in OA No.290/95 and batch. The petitioners were appointed  as Lecturers on  ad hoc  basis and some of them had obtained M.Phil, Ph.D. also. When the regular recruitment through the Public Service Commission [the ""Commission"", for short] was conducted, the   petitioners  also   appeared before the Commission but  they were not selected.

Singh, U.N. Singh, P.N. Gupta, H.S. Paul, J.  Buttar, Alok  Mahajan,  Advs.  with  him  for  the appearing parties. J U D G M E N T The following Judgment of the Court was delivered: WITH CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 738/91 Nanavati. J, The three  appellants were  tried  alongwith  13  other accused for various offences alleged t o have been committed by them  one of  them being  the  offence  punishable  under Section 302  IPC. The  trial court convicted appellant No. 1 only and  acquitted the  other accused  including  appellant Nos. 2  and 3.  Against his  conviction, appellant No. 1 has filed an  appeal in  the High Court and it is still pending. Against the  acquittal of  appellant No.  1 for  the offence punishable under  Section 302  and against  the acquittal of rest of  the accused, Bhajan Singh and Pritam Singh, who are original informant  and his  brother respectively,  filed  a Revision petition before the High Court. It appears  that the  appeal and  the Revision petition were heard  together and  the judgment in both the cases was reserved. Thereafter,  the High  Court  thought  it  fit  to dispose of  the Revision  petition filed by Bhajan Singh and Pritam Singh  but kept  the  appeal  filed  by  After  singh Pending till  the retrial ordered by the High Court is over. Therefore, the  three  accused  against  whom  an  order  of retrial is passed have approached this court. It  is   contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant that the order passed by the High Court is illegal inasmuch as  retrial could  not have  been  ordered  without setting aside the judgment passed by the trial court. As the appeal filed  by the  appellant No. 1 is pending in the High Court, we  do not  propose to  say anything also except that the order  passed by  the High  Court is clearly illegal. As retrial could  not have  been ordered  without setting aside http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the order of the trial court, on that short ground alone, we allow this  appeal and  set aside  the judgement  and  order passed by the High Court. In view  of this order, Crl. A. No. 738/91 preferred by appellant Nos.  2 and  3 will  not survive. Both the appeals are disposed of accordingly. The High  Court shall  now proceed  to hear  the appeal filed by appellant No. 1 and dispose of the same on merits.","The three appellants were  tried  alongwith  13 other accused for various offences alleged t o have been committed by them.

1481," With Criminal Appeal No. 8/91. J U D G M E N T NANAVATI,J. Both these  appeal arise  out of  the judgment  of  the andhra Pradesh  High Court  in Criminal  Appeal No. 1031/87. Criminal Appeal No. 691/90 if filed by S. Nagamalleswara (A- 3) and  S. Babu Rao (A-4). Criminal Appeal No. 8/91 is filed by V. Mankyala Rao (A-2). The appellants  have been  convicted under  Section 302 IPC  for  causing  death  of  K.  Sivaramakrishnaiah.  Their conviction is  based upon the evidence of PWs.1, 2 and 3 and the two  dying declarations  - Ex.P.15 and Ex.P.13. The High Court confirmed their conviction mainly relying upon the two dying declarations.  It held  that though PWs.1, 2 and 3 are partisan witnesses  their evidence could be utilised for the purpose of corroboration. Learned counsel  for the  appellants was  not  able  to point out  how PWs.2  and 3  who were  not  related  to  the deceased could  be regarded  as partisan witnesses. As their services were  hired for  the day  for cultivating  his land they were  with the deceased while he was returning from his field and  when the incident took place. Nothing was brought on record  to  show  that  they  has  any  enmity  with  the deceased. The  trial court  had rightly placed reliance upon their evidence.  As stated  earlier, the High Court has also relied  upon  their  evidence  though  for  the  purpose  of corroboration. The dying declaration Ex.P.15 was recorded by the Investigation officer at about 7.15 p.m. and Ex.P.13 was recorded by  the Judicial Magistrate at about 9.30 p.m. Both the dying  declarations have  been found as genuine and true and nothing could be urged by the learned counsel for taking a contrary  view. The  evidence of  PWs.2 and  3 and the two dying declarations  Ex.P.15 and  Ex.P.13  clearly  establish that the  appellants were  responsible for causing the death of K. Sivaramakrishnaiah. It  was  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellants that  as no  injuries were  caused on  the  vital parts of  the deceased, they should not have convicted under Section 302  IPC. This contention cannot be accepted because the medical  evidence clearly  shows that  the deceased  has http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 died due to the injuries caused to him and the injuries were sufficient in  the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Though not  on the  vital parts,  the injuries  caused  were serious.  Therefore,   the  appellants   have  been  rightly convicted under Section 302 read with 34 IPC. As we  find that they have been rightly convicted these appeals are dismissed. The  appellants   were  released  on  bail  during  the pendency of  these appeal.  Their bail is cancelled and they are ordered  to  surrender  to  custody  to  serve  out  the remaining part of their sentence.","S. Nagamalleswara, S. Babu Rao and V.

1482," JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(2) SCR 394 The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted A suit for issuance of permanent preventive injunction filed by the appellant herein was decreed by the Trial Court, The defendant preferred an appeal. The First Appellate Court reversed the decree of the Trial Court and directed the suit to be dismissed. The plaintiff preferred a second appeal which has been dismissed in limine by the High Court forming an opinion that the findings arrived at by the First Appellate Court were purely findings of fact and no substantial question of law within the meaning of Section 100 CPC arose for consideration. A perusal of the judgment of the First Appellate Court shows that the plaintiff-appellant did not appear in the witness box although his special power of attorney and other witnesses were examined by the plaintiff. The First Appellate Court influenced by the non-examination of the plaintiff drew an adverse inference against him and directed the suit to be dismissed solely on the ground of non-examination of the dismissed of the plaintiff. The judgment of the First Appellate Court shows that other evidence, though available on record, did not receive the attention of the First Appellate Court at all. In our opinion, the First Appellate Court was bound to apply its mind to all the evidence available on record and then test the legality of the findings arrived at by the Trial Court. While doing so, the First Appellate Court could have taken the factum of the non-examination of the plaintiff also into consideration. The manner in which the appeal has been disposed of by the First Appellate Court cannot be said to be satisfactory. Non- application of mind by the Appellate Court to other material, though available, and consequent failure of the Appellate Court to discharge its judicial obligation, did raise a question of law having a substantial impact on the rights of the parties, and therefore, the second appeal deserved to be heard on merits. Learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on Ishwar Bhai. C. Patel alias Bachu Bhai Patel v. Harihar Behera & Anr., [1999] 3 SCC, 457 wherein this Court has emphasised that withholding of the plaintiff himself from the witness box and thereby denying the defendant an opportunity for cross- examination of himself results into an adverse inference being drawn against the plaintiff. That proposition of law is undoubtable. However, as we have already said, that is a fact to be kept in view and taken in to consideration by the Appellate Court while appreciating other oral and documentary evidence available on record. May be that from other evidence - oral and documentary-produced by plaintiff, or otherwise brought on record, the plaintiff has been able to discharge the onus which lay on him, and, subject to the court forming that opinion, a mere abstention of plaintiff http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 himself from the witness box may pale into insignificance. In the facts and circumstances of this case remanding the matter to High Court for re-hearing would only prolong the life of litigation. As we are satisfied of the failure on the part of the First Appellate Court in discharging its obligation-statutory and judicial, more so when it is a judgment of reversal, it would meet the ends of justice if the first appeal itself is directed to be heard afresh. The appeal is allowed. The order of the High Court dismissing the appeal in limine as also the judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court are set aside, The appeal shall stand restored on the file of the First Appellate Court which shall be heard and decided afresh, consistently with the observations made hereinabove and in accordance with law.

1483," O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises  from  the  order dated June  14, 1971  of he Division Bench of the High Court of Madras  in Appeal  against Order No. 34 and 174 and 1973. The facts are fairly clear. On April  4, 1971,  while the  deceased  Rajadurai  was driving the  motor cycle  from western  direction to eastern direction on  the National  Highway Madras  to Bangalore  at Kathur Junction,  a motor  vehicle had come in between. As a consequence, he  had taken  extreme right  to save his life. Consequently, the  but his  the motor  cycle. As a result of which he  died on the spot. The appellants are the widow and the children  of the  deceased who  was aged about 31 years. The finding of the Tribunal is that the deceased was earning Rs. 800/-  per month.  On that  basis the Tribunal awarded a sum of  Rs. 1  lakh. The  Tribunal held  that  there  was  a contributory negligence.  On that  basis, after  giving  the benefit of contributory negligence it fixed the amount at s. 1 lakh.  The High  Court reversed  the finding on the ground that the  diver of  the bust  was not  negligent. The entire negligence  was   on  the   part  of   the  deceased.  As  a consequence,  the   appellants  are   not  entitled  to  the compensation. Thus this appeal by special leave. We have  scanned the evidence and reasoning of the High Court and  the Tribunal.  Unfortunately, the  High Court has not considered  the evidence  from the  proper  perspective. Since the  driver of  the bus  equally was  driving at  high speed, greater  care was  required of  him to  see  that  no accident took  place. It would appear from the circumstances that the  deceased, with  a view to save  himself from being sandwiched between  the car  and the  bus, had  taken to the extreme right.  As a  consequence, he hit the left bumper of the bus.  It would  thus be clear that the driver of the bus equally contributed  to  the  accident.  On  the  facts  and circumstances. We  think that  negligence can be apportioned http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 as 60%  and 40%.  As a consequence, the respondent is liable to pay  compensation of  Rs. 60,000/- and Rs. 40,000/- would be foregone  by the  appellants. Under  these circumstances, the order  of the  High Court is set aside. The order of the Tribunal is  also modified.  The appellants  a entitled to a sum of  Rs. 60,000/-  with interest  at 60% from the date of the judgment  of the  Tribunal dated  November 30,  1972. It would appear  that  the  original  Insurance  Company  which insured the  vehicle having  been taken  over by  the United India Insurance Company, which is a nationalized company, is liable to pay proportionately to the extent of the insurance cover. The  appellants are  entitled to  recover the  amount from the Company and the balance from the owner. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the application under Section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was not maintainable. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent very fairly states before us that the issue which was raised before the Labour Court was as to whether despite the availability of the workmen, the appellant-Board could refuse to take any work from them without issuing any order of termination of their services. Such an issue, in our opinion, could be the subject matter of an industrial dispute warranting  reference by the appropriate Government in terms of Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act.  In that view of the matter, a proceeding under Section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act was not maintainable. -2- However, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent also very fairly states that subsequently, an industrial dispute has been raised. If that be so, the contention of the respondent that the appellant-Board was bound to pay his salary for the period from June, 1997 to November, 1999 undisputedly would fall for consideration in the said reference case, being ancillary to the said reference.

The  appellant was appointed initially on ad hoc basis on March  3, 1387  and thereafter  with a view to regularise his services, he was put on probation. During probation, his services having  been found  to be  not  satisfactory,  were terminated  by   proceedings  dated   December  1,1989.  The appellant came to challenge the same by filing writ petition in November  1990 which was dismissed by the High Court thus this Peal by special leave. It  is  contended  by  the  appellant  that  since  the averments made  in the  counter would  constitute foundation for dismissal  for misconduct, an enquiry in this behalf was required to  be made.  On the other hand, it is contended by the respondent  that during  the probation the appellant did not acquire  any right  to  the  post.  If  on  being  found suitable  he  was  regularised,  only  then  he  would  have acquired  the   right  to   Continue  in  the  post.  During probation,  it   was  found   that  his  services  were  not satisfactory and reasons were given in support thereof. Thus they do  not constitute  foundation but  active to terminate the services.  We  find  force  in  the  contention  of  the respondent. They  have explained  that the  driving  of  the staff car  was not  satisfactory and  that, therefore,  they have  terminated   the  services  of  the  appellant  during probation. The  very object  of the probation is to test the suitability and  if the  appointing authority finds that the candidate  is  not  suitable,  it  certainly  has  power  to terminate  the   services  of   the  employee.  Under  these circumstances, it  cannot  but  be  held  that  the  reasons mentioned  Constituted   motive  and   not  foundation   for termination of  service. Therefore,  we hold  that the  High http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Court has not committed any error of law. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

No. 147 of 1982. W.A. Quadri and Kailash Mehta for the Appellant. M.C. Dhingra for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI  MUKHARJI,  J. This is an appeal  by  special leave  against the judgment and order dated the 16th  March, 1982 of the High Court of Delhi in Civil Revision No. 147 of 1982  directing eviction of the premises in  question  under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act on the ground of  bonafide requirement of the landlord. The special  leave was  sought for and obtained from this Court on  the  ground that  Civil  Appeal No. 1051/81 and special  leave  petition (civil)  No. 2290/82 were pending at that time.  It  appears that  the said appeal has been disposed of by this Court  in Ravi Dutt Sharma v. Ratan Lal Bhargava, [1984] 2 S.C.R.  614 where this Court held that Sections 14A, 14(e), 25A, 25B and 25C of the Delhi Rent Control Act are special provisions  so far as the landlord and tenant are concerned and further  in view of the non-obstante clause in the section these  provi- sions override the existing law so far as the new  procedure is  concerned.  In  that view of the matter we  are  of  the opinion that the Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1956 would have no application in cases covered by  Sections 14A and 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act especially in view of the provisions which were added by the Amending  Act of 1976. This  Court held that there is no difference  either  on principle or in law between section 14(1)(e) and 14A of  the Rent Act even though these two provisions relate to eviction of tenants under different situations. This Court further held that in view of the procedure in Chapter  IIIA  of  the Rent Act, the Slum  Act  is  rendered inapplicable  to the extent of inconsistency and it is  not, therefore,  necessary for the landlord to obtain  permission of  the  Competent Authority under Section 19(1)(a)  of  the Slum  Act before instituting a suit for eviction and  coming within  Section  14(1)(e)  or 14A of the Rent  Act.  In  the premises the appeal fails and is dismissed.

It dilated  at  length  on Hindu Law but, with  great  respect, missed  the point that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal  is the  final  fact-finding  authority and, as  it  has  itself noticed  in  the judgment under challenge, the Tribunal  had held  that the remuneration and cornmission received by  the Karta  of  the  HUF  were earned by him on  account  of  his personal  qualifications and exertions and not on account of the  investment  of  the family funds in  the  company  and, therefore, could not be treated as the income of the HUF. The  High  Court,  having analysed  the  law,  rightly concluded  that the broad principle that emerged was whether the remuneration received by the coparcener was in substance one of the modes of return made to the family because of the investment of the family funds in the business or whether it was   compensation  made  for   services  rendered  by   the individual  coparcener.   If it was the former, it  was  the income  of  the HUF:  but if it was the latter, then it  was the  income  of  the individual coparcener.   Applying  this test,  the High Court held, ""There is absolutely no evidence http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to support the contention of the learned counsel for the assessee  that the development of the business was due to  any peculiar qualification or experience on the part  of the assessee.  "" We  cannot agree.  Having analysed the law, as ""it did correctly,  the  High  Court should have taken note  of  the finding  recorded by the Tribunal and noticed by it earlier, namely,  that  the  remuneration and  commission  that  were earned by the Karta were earned by him on account of his personal  qualifications  and  exertions  and  not  on account  of  the  investment  of   the  family  funds   and, therefore, should have held that the -income could not be treated as the Income of the HUP. In  the result, the appeals are allowed.  The judgment and  order  under  appeal  1s set aside.   The  question  is answered  in the negative and In favour of the assessee.

1491," ORDER 1.   Leave granted. 2.   This  appeal arises out of an order made by  a  learned Single  Judge of the High Court of Judicature at  Madras  on 9th   November,   1993,  in   Criminal   Original   Petition No.8730/92, Crl.  M.P.No.4794/92 and Crl.M.P. 6765/92.   The learned  Judge quashed the First Information  Report,  Crime No.  246/92 of P.S. Tallakulam, in so far as the  respondent to  concerned  as also the  criminal  proceedings  emanating therefrom against him. 3.   We  have gone through the order of the  learned  Single Judge and heard learned counsel for the parties. 4.   M.S.K.Shanmugovol Chettiyar lodged a first  information report  at P.S. Tallakulam against the respondents  alleging commission of offences under Section 147/148/342/323/395/500 (ii) and 109 IPC.  Investigation was taken in hand and  some evidence  was  collected by the investigating  agency.   The respondent filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. in the High  Court  and  by the impugned  order  the  petition  was allowed and the proceedings emanating from crime case 246/92 (supra)  were quashed.  From a bare perusal of the order  of the learned single Judge it appears that while quashing  the proceedings  reliance,  has been placed upon  some  evidence collected   by   the   investigating   agency   during   the investigation.  The approach of the learned Judge in relying upon  such evidence, which is yet to be produced before  the trial  court,  to quash the criminal  proceedings  in  crime cases  No.246/92  (supra)  was not  proper.   The  power  of quashing a FIR and criminal proceedings should be  exercised sparingly  by  the Courts.  Indeed, the High Court  has  the extra-ordinary or inherent power to reach out injustice  and quash the First Information Report and criminal proceedings, keeping  in view the guidelines laid down by this  Court  in various judgments (reference in this connection may be  made with  advantage to State of Haryana & Ors. v. Bhajan  Lal  & http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Ors.  (1992 Supp. (1) 335) but the same has to be done  with circumspection.   The normal process of the  criminal  trial cannot  be cut short in a rather casual manner.  The  Court, is  not  justified in embarking upon an enquiry  as  to  the reliability  or genuineness of the allegations made  in  the FIR of the complaint on the basis of the evidence  collected during  investigation  only while dealing  with  a  petition under  Section 432 Cr.P.C. seeking the quashing of  the  FIR and  the  criminal proceedings.  The  learned  single  Judge apparently fell into an error in evaluating the  genuineness and,  reliability of the allegations made in the FIR on  the basis  of the evidence collected during  the  investigation. The order of the learned single Judge cannot, therefore,  be sustained.   This  appeal  succeeds  and  is  allowed.   The impugned order of the High Court is hereby set aside. 5.   We  clarify  that nothing said hereinabove  or  by  the learned  single  Judge  of the High Court  in  the  impugned judgment  shall be constructed as any expression of  opinion on  the merits of the case, expressly or impliedly, and  the trial court shall deal with 168 the case uninfluenced by any of the observations made by the High Court or by this Court. 170","This appeal arises out of an order made by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Madras.

The question arose junior lecturers during holidays and leave period  are entitled  to the  payment of  compensatory allowance.

Per majority, it was held that they are entitled to the payment of the allowance during the leave  or  vacation  period.  It  would  be  seen  that  the Lecturers  would   not  perform  any  official  duty  during holidays. If  at all  they have done they would evaluate the examination papers  for which  they would be paid the amount for evaluating  the papers.  Under these  circumstances, the majority members  were not right in concluding that they are discharging the official duties during the vacation or leave period and  they are entitled to the compensatory allowance.

1495," O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the Allahabad High Court, made on September 3, 1985 in CMWP No. 174/85. The admitted position is that the appellant was working as a  Headmaster in  a Junior High School from July 1974. In July 1976,  the school  was upgraded  as a  High School. The question had  arisen for  appointment of  Headmaster to  the said school.  An advertisement was made for selection of the Headmaster. The  appellant along  with other had applied for ad the Selection Committee constituted under Section 16-E of the U.P.  Intermediate Eduction Act. 1921 selected the fifth respondent  to  the  said  post.  Calling  in  question  the selection of  the fifth respondent, namely, Man Singh Verma, the appellant  filed a  writ petition and obtained stay. The Writ petition  was dismissed by the High Court, holding that the  appellant   was  not   possessed   of   the   requisite qualification of  four years’ experience and, therefore, the selection was not vitiated on that count. Shri D.K.  Garg,  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant contends, that  since at  the time  of  upgradation  of  the school  as  full-fledged  High  School,  the  appellant  was already having  the requisite experience, and was working on ad hoc Headmaster, he would have been confirmed as promotee; therefore, the selection by the Committee was not necessary. Hence, the  view of the High Court is not correct in law. We find no  force in  the contention.  It is  seen  that  under Regulation 2(1)  of the  Regulations made under the Act, the post of  Head of  an institution  shall be  filed by  direct recruitment, after  reference  to  the  Selection  Committee constituted under  sub-section (1) of Section 16F or, as the case may be, under sub-section (1) of Section 16FF. Appendix A of  Part  V  attached  to  the  U.P.  Secondary  Education Services Commission Rules, 1983 lays down the qualifications which postulates ""with an experience of teaching for at leas four years  in a  training  institution  recognised  by  the Department or  in higher  classes  of  a  recognised  higher secondary School or in both combined or having at least four years’ experience  as a  trained Graduate  Headmaster  of  a Junior High  School recognised  by the  Department, provided http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 also that he/she is not below 30 years in age."" The post  of Headmaster  under Section  16-E(2) has  be filled in  by promotion  or by  direct recruitment after due publication by the Committee. The proviso to sub-section (3) should not  be used  as a  routine for exempting the persons who were  not possessed or the requisite qualifications as a short route  to appoint  unqualified persons  to the post of Headmaster. It  should   be used  sparingly  and  not  as  a routine, with  all reasons  for such  an  appointment  which would be subject to judicial review. It is  seen that  the appellant  was appointed  in July 1974, as  the Headmaster  of a  Junior High School which was upgraded in  the year  1976. Thus,  he did  not have the due experience of  four years  as a  Headmaster of a Junior High School. Though  Shri Garg  has placed before us the previous experience of  the appellant  at different  places, they are only in  his capacity  as Assistant  Teacher, for  the years 1964-65, 1965-66; in the Higher Secondary School, he is said to have  worked as Hadmaster Secondary School, he is said to have worked  as Headmaster  of tow  years. Up  is seen  that since he  has not  completed the  requisite experience to be eligible to  the post  of Headmaster, the selection of fifth respondent  made   by  the   committee  constituted  by  the Inspector in this behalf, is correct in law. The  appeal,   therefore,  falls.   It  is  accordingly dismissed.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court allowing the second appeal filed by the respondent no.1 under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the ’CPC’). Respondent No.1 is the plaintiff and  had filed the suit for specific performance of the contract of sale dated 31.1.1972. Suit was decreed by the Trial Court and the appeal was dismissed by the First Appellate Court.  The second defendant-respondent no.2 took the stand that he was the purchaser subsequent to the agreement for sale, he had no knowledge of the agreement and had no notice of the sale and he is not bound by the earlier agreement of sale.  The Trial Court came to hold that defendant no.2 had knowledge of the agreement.  The First Appellate Court held that either he had dishonest notion or had notice.  At the time of the admission in the second appeal the following question of law was formulated: ""Whether the Court below was just in placing reliance on the order of the Assistant Commissioner, who rejected the permission of sale of the land and thus hold against the appellant?"" Thereafter with the following observations/conclusions the second appeal was allowed. ""When the trial court on evidence has come to the conclusion on seeing the witness in the box, appreciated the demeanor, the appellate court without considering the points raised by the trial court went on discussing the legal position and came to a different conclusion which I have no hesitation, to set aside on the ground that they are not warranted by the facts of the case. The entire approach of the appellate court is vitiated by the pre-considered mind that the agreement of sale cannot be given effect to once there was a sale in between the parties. This view is certainly wrong http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and under such pre-considered notion, the approach made by the appellate court which has resulted in wrong delivery of the judgment."" Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the second appeal was allowed without indicating any basis and reason.  The conclusions are also without any foundation.  It was erroneously held that the entire approach of First Appellate Court was vitiated by pre-conceived mind that the agreement of sale cannot be given effect once there was a sale in between the parties.  No such finding was recorded by the First Appellate Court. Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that though the judgment of the High Court is not happily worded, yet in essence the High Court has found First Appellate Court’s conclusion to be vitiated. Perusal of the order of the High Court quoted above shows that there was total non-application of mind.  There is practically no reason indicated as to why the High Court took the view that First Appellate Court’s order was on account of a pre-conceived mind.  Merely because the Trial Court had occasion to see the witness that cannot be a ground to hold that First Appellate Court had pre-conceived notion.  No reasons had been indicated by the High Court to set aside  the order of the First Appellate Court even without analysing the evidence and the respective stand. We, therefore, set aside the order of the High Court, remit the matter to the High Court for fresh disposal on merits.

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant on the ground that an award passed by the Central Government Industrial Tribunal- cum-Labour Court, Kanpur (in short the ’Tribunal’) was being assailed belatedly and the writ petition was dismissed on the ground of laches. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. It did not take note of the factual background and on the erroneous assumptions that an award of the Tribunal made in 1992 was being belatedly challenged, the writ petition was dismissed. He referred to several factual details which we shall deal with infra. There is no appearance on behalf of the respondents in spite of notice. The order of the High Court reads as follows: ""The petitioner has challenged award of 1992. The petition is highly belated and is dismissed on the ground of laches."" Factual position which is almost undisputed is that some casual labourers raised a dispute before the Tribunal.  The appellant took the stand that the concerned labourers who were casual workers had deliberately remained absent from duty for more than six months.  Those six persons were engaged on daily wages basis in the Telecommunication Department under the SDO, Bijnor.  When they reported back after their voluntary absence they were not given any benefit for the past service and it was decided to treat them to have joined w.e.f. 7.5.1985.  The Tribunal by its award dated 17.3.1992 came to hold that there was, in fact, termination, and there was no compliance with requirements of Section 25- F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and, therefore, the action of the Department was illegal and unjustified. According to the Tribunal they were entitled to reinstatement with full back wages and consequential benefits.  The Department filed an Original Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad Bench (in short ’CAT’). http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The Original Application was admitted on 5.5.1993 and stay on the direction for the payment of back wages was granted. Subsequently, it was brought to the notice of the CAT that in view of the decision of this Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. The Union of India & Others (JT 1997 (3) SC 589) the proceedings before the CAT were not maintainable.  By order dated 17.12.1997 CAT disposed of the matter holding that the proceedings before it were not maintainable.  It was, however, inter alia observed as follows: ""Nothing in this order shall however, preclude the applicant from seeking redressal of his grievances from an appropriate forum."" The writ application was filed in February, 1998 and has been dismissed as afore-noted by order dated 30.4.1998. A perusal of the factual scenario as noted above clearly indicates that the writ petition was not belated as was observed by the High Court. It is unfortunate that the High Court did not take note of the relevant factors and the intervening circumstances and by a cryptic order dismissed the writ application holding that it was highly belated.  Had the High Court applied its mind to the factual background facts it could not have come to the conclusions as arrived at. It is true, if there is abnormal delay in filing a writ petition and there is no plausible explanation for the same, the Court can decline to entertain it on the ground of laches. But the fact situation is entirely different here. In paragraphs 47 to 50 of the writ petition filed before the High Court, all relevant details were indicated.

(Writ Petition No. 6167 of 1990) dated July 2, 1990 wherein  direction has  been given  that the said Rajiv http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Kumar Shukla  who was shown at serial No. 34 in the approved list of  candidates be  considered for appointment according to rules  against the post which shall said become available in District Hardoi and in pursuance of the said order he has been appointed on regular basis.

1501," O R D E R Delay condoned. Substitution and impleadment allowed. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and order  of the  Karnataka High  Court, made on January 6, 1992 in RSA No. 933/78. The admitted  position is  that one Radhabai, mother of the appellants  was the  owner of 4 acres 38 gunthas of land in Paschayapur  Village in  Bijapur Taluka  and District  in Karnataka State. According to her, she, with a view to dig a well in  R.S. No. 299, namely, the same land, had obtained a loan in  the year  1961 from the father of the respondent in the a sum of Rs. 1,000/-, Since she was not in a position to complete the digging of the well, she approached again for a sum of  Rs. 2,000/-  to complete  the well. the respondent’s father who  is a  Constable had  advanced the  money on  the condition that  she would execute the sale deed in favour of his  minor  son,  i.e.,  the  respondent.  Accordingly,  she executed the  sale deed  with an  agreement of re-conveyance which was  accordingly executed  on  August  31,  1961.  She stated that  she has  paid from  time to  time a  sum of Rs. 7,000/- and  she asked  the respondent  to execute  the  re- conveyance and  the respondent  had not executed the deed of re-conveyance. Consequently, she filed the suit for specific performance. The  trial Judge  decreed OS  No. 4/1966 on the file of  the Additional Munsif, Bijapur on April 3, 1976. On appeal, the  Additional Civil  Judge allowed  the appeal  on November 7,  1977 and  dismissed the suit. The second appeal was dismissed  by the  High  Court.  Thus,  this  appeal  by special leave. The High  Court found  that since  the agreement of re- conveyance was  not for the benefit of the minor, the decree for specific performance cannot be granted. The leave of the court was  not obtained  for entering into such an agreement and, therefore, the appellant is not entitled to the benefit of the  specific  performance.  We  find  no  force  in  the reasoning of  the High  Court in the facts and circumstances of this  case. It  is seen  that appellant’s  mother is  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 owner of  the property.  She  had  obtained  loan  from  the respondent and  executed the  sale deed with an agreement of re-conveyance.  When   the  father  of  the  respondent  had obtained the  sale deed  in the name of the minor, obviously he is  bound by  the agreement  of  re-conveyance  as  well. Having received  the money,  he had  not executed  the  sale deed. Necessarily,  the appellants  are entitled to seek the specific  performance.   Under  these   circumstances,   the question that agreement was not for the benefit of the minor which is  a legal  proposition, cannot  be  applied  to  the facts. It  is contended  that subsequent  purchaser from the father of  the respondent of the self-same property, without knowledge of  the pendency  of the  suit  is  bound  by  the agreement.  We   find  no   force  in  the  contention.  The appellants have  been seeking  the remedy in the civil suit; any subsequent  sale will  be barred  by the doctrine of lis pendes. Therefore,  the subsequent purchaser is bound by the decree of  specific performance  and liable  to reconvey the property to the appellants. The decree of the trial Judge is accordingly restored  and that  of the  High Court  and  the Additional Civil  Judge  stand  set  aside.  The  remedy  of recovery of  the purchased  money from the respondent may be sought in an appropriate action. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

1502," RAJENDRA BABU, J. : Pursuant to an agreement entered into on August 28, 1993 the property comprised in A-3, East of Kailash, New Delhi  measuring 306 sq. mts. is agreed to be sold for Rs.70 lakhs.  The Appropriate Authority in exercise of the powers under Chapter XX-C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 considered that there is under-statement of value of the property on the basis of that property comprised in E-326, East of Kailash, New Delhi had been agreed to be sold for Rs.51 lakhs under an agreement dated May 23, 1993.  While the salvage value of the sale instance property referred to in the notice was considered at about Rs.55,000/-, the value of the subject property was taken at about Rs.93,000/-.  It was contended that the value of the building on property E-326, East of Kailash, New Delhi as on the date of agreement would be Rs.10 lakhs and that is to be taken into consideration while working out the land value and also the fact that the subject property is surrounded by jhuggi jhompri as compared to property comprised in E-326, East of Kailash, New Delhi which faces Greater Kailash-I, on the one side, and Nehru Place, on the other, and that the size of the plot of the subject property was bigger [while the subject property is measuring about 300 sq. mts., the sale instance property is measuring about 167 sq. mts.].  It is also contended that the value of the properties which are in C, D and E Blocks of East of Kailash, New Delhi is higher as compared to the value of the property in Block A.  The Appropriate Authority rejected the contentions raised on behalf of the seller [respondents herein] and proceeded to order acquisition of the property.  While in the High Court, it was noticed that the show cause notice had indicated the salvage value of the property at Rs.93,000/-, but in the impugned order it was taken at about Rs.9.92 lakhs, for coming to the conclusion that the fair market value was beyond the permissible 15 per cent limit.  Neither the fact nor the basis for concluding that the building value is high as more than 10 times was disclosed to the parties.  It appears that the two valuation reports obtained before the issue of show cause notice also did not indicate any under-valuation.  Further the instance of property No.A-32 relied upon by the parties was rejected on irrelevant consideration.  For one purpose valuation is sought to be relied upon and for another purpose the same is sought to be ignored.  Just as the fact that comparison of incomparable properties is fallacious, non-comparison of comparable properties is equally fallacious. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Some other contentions were also advanced on behalf of the Department in this case which are identical to the one raised in C.A. Nos. 6050-51 of 1998.  For the very reasons stated therein, these contentions are also rejected. Therefore, the view taken by the High Court cannot be faulted with at all and the basis indicated in the order of the High Court as summarized above is sufficient to set aside the order made by the Appropriate Authority.

We are  of opinion  that the learned District Judge who heard the  appeal  filed  by  the  State  and    the  cross- objections filed  by the  respondents was  not competent  to award solatium  and interest  as per  provisions of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 (as amended by the 1984 Amendment Act). Accordingly, we  delete the award of solatium and also award of interest at the rate and for the periods mentioned in the order of the learned District Judge. We, however, affirm the quantum of  compensation awarded  by the  Arbitrator at  Rs. 3.61 lacs  (excluding the amount of Rs. 72037.85 paise which already been  paid to  the respondents  in the  year  1982). Having regard  to the  facts  and circumstances of the case, however, we  direct that  the said  amount of  Rs. 3.61 lacs shall carry interest at the rate of 12 per cent  simple from the date  of the  decree of  the learned  Subordinate Judge, i.e., the  date on  which the learned Subordinate Judge made the award  a rule  of the  Court. The said interest shall be payable till the date of payment.

1505," JUDGMENT O R D E R [with SLP (C) Nos. 20226-20228 of 2003] Heard parties at great length. These Special Leave Petitions are against the Judgments of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated 21st December, 2001 dismissing the Appeal filed by the Petitioners and the Judgment dated 4th October, 2002 dismissing the Review Petition. We see no substance in the contention that there has been non- appreciation or misinterpretation of evidence.  In our view, the Courts below have correctly analyzed the evidence on record and correctly concluded, on the basis of material on record, that the Petitioner had entered into the Agreement to Sell not just on his own behalf but also on behalf of the other parties.   The Courts below also have correctly recorded that the possession had been taken on behalf of all. The case sought to be made out that after notice dated 11th September, 1976, calling upon the Respondents 1 to 8 to pay their shares, the Petitioner had cut off the other Respondents as they had not paid their share is not even pleaded.  In any case it is not believeable in view of the various documents wherein the Petitioner himself has been stating that the purchase had been made on behalf of all. We also see no substance in the contention that the Suit was barred by limitation and that the Courts below should have decided the question of limitation.  When limitation is the pure question of law and from the pleadings itself it becomes apparent that a suit is barred by limitation, then, of course, it is the duty of the Court to decide limitation at the outset even in the absence of a plea. However, in cases where the question of limitation is a mixed question of fact and law and the Suit does not appear to be barred by limitation on the face of it, then the facts necessary to prove limitation must be pleaded, an issue raised and then proved.  In this case the question of limitation is intricately linked with the question whether the Agreement to Sell was entered into on behalf of all and whether possession was on behalf of all.  It is also linked with the plea of adverse possession.  Once on facts it has been found that the purchase was on behalf of all and that the possession was on behalf of all, then, in the absence of any open, hostile and overt act, there can be no adverse possession and the Suit would also not be barred by limitation.  The only hostile act which could be shown was the advertisement issued in 1989.  The Suit filed almost immediately thereafter. We also see no substance in the contention that no consideration has flowed from the other Respondents.  The Petitioner in his own evidence-in-chief admits that some amounts were paid jointly.  This is clear from the fact that in respect of some payments he uses the word ""I paid"" but in respect of others he deposes ""we paid"".  Even otherwise, the contention that no consideration has flowed is contrary http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to the terms of the Agreement.  Also the evidence of D.W. 3 shows that in 1967, when the Agreement to Sell was entered into, the Petitioner had no income and no monies.   This also belies his claim that he alone had paid. We also see no substance in the submission of Mr. Ramachandran that there is no finding on Issue No. 1.  In our view, once the finding was reached on Issue No. 5 the answer to Issue No. 1 followed.   Even otherwise, both these Issues have been dealt with together and the reasoning given by the trial Court for answering these two Issues in favour of the Respondents applies to both these Issues. In view of the above, we see no infirmity in the impugned Judgments.  We see no reason to interfere.  The Special Leave Petitions stand dismissed with no order as to costs.","We see no substance in the contention that there has been non- appreciation or misinterpretation of evidence.

1506," O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Orissa High Court in CJC No. 1970/89 dated  19th July,  1991. The  respondent No. 1 was a conductor in  the appellant-Corporation. While he was posted in  the  District  of  Baripada,  he  committed  misconduct, Disciplinary enquiry  was conducted against him and on proof of his  misconduct, he  was dismissed  from  service,  while Industrial Dispute  Case No.25  of 1981  under Section 10(1) (d) of  the Industrial  Disputes Act,  1947 [for  short, the ""Act""]  was   pending  decision.  The  respondent  filed  an application under  Section 33  (1) (a) of the Act contending that since  the dispute  relating to  an employee in Bhadrad zone was  pending adjudication  in the  Industrial Tribunal, without the  leave of  the Tribunal  under Section  33-A his service could  not be terminated. The Tribunal dismissed the petition but in the writ petition, the Division Bench in the impugned judgment has set aside that order and held that the order of  dismissal is  bad in  law. It is now admitted that pending  this  appeal,  the  respondent  was  reinstated  in September 1993 on his undertaking that he will not claim any back-wages. The question  is: whether  the view  taken by  the High Court is  correct in  law? It  is not  in dispute  that  for administrative   convenience,   efficacy   and   coordinated transport  operations   and  transaction  of  business,  the Corporation by  its resolution  created divisions, zones and special zones,  with regard  to the  area of  its  operation under the  Motor Vehicles  Act. The respondent is working in Baripada Zone,  while the  pending dispute in the Industrial Dispute case  relates to  the employee  working  in  Bhadrak Zone. It is  seen that  this Court  in Isha  Steel Treatment, Bombay v.  Association of Engineering Workers, Bombay & Anr. [(1987) 2 SCC 203] had considered a similar question whether there was  functional integrity  between the  office at  the Churchgate and  the factory  at Trombay. It was held that in the absence  of any  functional integrity,  separate offices http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 could be  created as  independent units  and they  cannot be deemed as  one unit.  In support  thereof,  this  Court  had relied on  an earlier  judgment in  Workmen v.  Straw  Board Manufacturing Co.  Ltd. [(1974)  SCC 681].  The  same  ratio applies to  the facts  of this  case. As stated earlier, for efficient  transaction   of  the  business  and  coordinated services of  the transport  operations, several  zones  have been created by the Corporation and each zone is independent of its  operational efficacy.  Therefore, all  the zones are not an  integral part  or parcel  of  coordinated  transport service as  a  single  unit.  In  these  circumstances,  the decision of  the High  Court that  all the  zones  would  be considered to  be and  integral unit  of the Corporation and pendency of industrial dispute in respect of one employee of a different  zones would be a bar for the management to take disciplinary action  against an  employee in that particular zone is  clearly wrong. We are of the opinion that in such a case there  is no need for the management to seek and obtain leave of  the Industrial Tribunal under Section 33a-A of the Act. The appeal  is according  disposed of. However, in view of the  understanding between  the appellant and the workmen and as  he has  already been  reinstated without  any  back- wages, this  order would  not stand  as an impediment in the way of  the respondent  to continue  to be  in  service.

I respectfully agree and would allow the appeal as proposed by my learned brother. 2.              The law relating to contracts of insurance is part of the general law of contract.  So said Roskill Lord Justice in Cehave vs. Bremer ([1976] Q.B. 44).      This view was approved by Lord Wilberforce in Reardon Smith vs. Hanson-Tangen (1976 [1 WLR] 989, wherein he said ""it is desirable that the same legal principles should apply to the law of contract as a whole and that different principles should not apply to the different branches of that law"".   A contract of insurance is to be construed in the first place from the terms used in it, which terms are themselves to be understood in their primary, natural, ordinary and popular sense.   ( See Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance 7th Edition paragraph 2-01).  A policy of insurance has therefore to be construed like any other contract.  On a construction of the contract in question it is clear that the insurer had not undertaken the liability for interest and penalty, but had undertaken to indemnify the employer only to reimburse the compensation the employer was liable to pay among other things under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.   Unless one is in a position to void the exclusion clause concerning liability for interest and penalty imposed on the insured on account of his failure to comply with the requirements of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1923, the insurer cannot be made liable to the insured for those amounts. 3.              Section 17 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act voids only a contract or agreement whereby a workman relinquishes any right of compensation from the employer for personal injury arising out of or in the course of the employment and insofar as it purports to remove or reduce the liability of any person to pay compensation under the Act.   As my learned brother has noticed, in the Workmen’s Compensation Act, there are no provisions corresponding to those in the Motor Vehicles Act, insisting on the insurer covering the entire liability arising out of an award towards compensation to a third party arising out of a motor accident.   It is not brought to our notice that there is any other law enacted which stands in the way of an insurance company and the insured entering into a contract confining the obligation of the insurance http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 company to indemnify to a particular head or to a particular amount when it relates to a claim for compensation to a third party arising under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.   In this situation, the obligation of the insurance company clearly stands limited and the relevant proviso providing for exclusion of liability for interest or penalty has to be given effect to.  Unlike the scheme of the Motor Vehicles Act the Workmen’s Compensation Act, does not confer a right on the claimant for compensation under that Act to claim the payment of compensation in its entirety from the insurer himself. The entitlement of the claimant under the Workmen’s Compensation Act is to claim the compensation from the employer.   As between the employer and the insurer, the rights and obligations would depend upon the terms of the insurance contract.   Construing the contract involved here it is clear that the insurer has specifically excluded any liability for interest or penalty under the Workmen’s Compensation Act and confined its liability to indemnify the employer only against the amount of compensation ordered to be paid under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.   The High Court was, therefore, not correct in holding that the appellant\027 insurance company, is also liable to pay the interest on the amount of compensation awarded by the Commissioner.  The workman has to recover it from the employer.","Law relating to contracts of insurance is part of the general law of contract.

Ahmed are before us, praying for enhancement of the amount of compensation for his death arising out of a motor accident which took place on 3.9.2003. The deceased was riding on a motorcycle. It dashed with a jeep for which a criminal case was instituted. A claim petition was filed by the appellants herein claiming compensation for a sum of Rs.25,95,000/-. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal awarded a total sum of Rs. 6 lakhs. On the premise that the income of the deceased at the time of accident was Rs. 5,000/- per month, multiplier of 15 was applied by the learned Tribunal. An appeal was preferred thereagainst by the respondent-Insurance Company. Before the High Court, a plea was raised that the deceased was also negligent in riding the motorcycle and having regard  to the fact that the same contributed to the accident, the quantum of compensation paid in favour of the claimants should be held to be on the higher side.  The said contention was rejected by the High Court. The High Court having regard to the materials brought on records was of the opinion that application of the multiplier of 15 was improper. It applied multiplier of 12, and in terms thereof the amount of compensation was quantified at Rs. 4,49,500/-. Interest on the said sum was allowed at the rate of 6% per annum. Quantification of compensation in a case of this nature would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Ordinarily, the Appellate Court should not interfere with the amount of compensation assessed by the Tribunal but there may be some exceptional case. Even in terms of the Second Schedule appended to the Motor Vehicles Rules, a multiplier of 16 could have been applied. Having regard to the age of the deceased a multiplier of 15 could have been applied and if the same had not been done by the Tribunal, there was no reason as to why the High Court should have interfered therewith. For the reasons aforementioned, we allow this appeal in part and direct that an award be prepared applying the multiplier of 15 instead of 12.

Heard learned counsel for the parties. The brief facts are as followed: Pursuant to advertisement for selection of junior grade typists, altogether 871 cand idates were empanelled for appointment.  The list was published on 3.12.1987.  Amongst the 871 selected candidates, 845 belong to general category and 27 candidates belong to scheduled ca ste category.  Out of 845 of general category candidates, 184 were duly appointed.  All the 27 candidates of schedule castes were also appointed. The remaining general category candidates who were not appointed, though selected, approached the tribunal.  The tribunal directed the State to give them appointment by Order dated 1.3.1993.  It is stated that the order of the tribunal has not been challenged.  Howev er, since there was no compliance with the order of the tribunal, a writ petition was preferred before the Division Bench of the High Court.  The Division  Bench by  its impugned  order directed that the respondents should be given appointment.  Aggrieved thereby, these Special Leave Petitions have been filed by way of Special Leave. The first difficulty that we face in these cases is that the selection list was publ ished on 3.12.1987.  Today we are in 2008.  The second difficulty is that by now it is a well settled principle of law that a selectee does not have an indefeasible right for appointment,  and, therefore, by virtue of being selected no enforceable right has accrued to the selected candidates.  This has been held by a catena of judgments of this Court. Also we are dismayed to note that the High Court directed the respondent (appellant herein) to implement the orde r of the tribunal, as if the High Court is sitting as an Executing Court in exercise of the po wer under Article 226 of the Constitution.  The High Court’s power under Article 226 of the Constitution is available only in the case of miscarriage of justice and where there is erro r of law apparent on the face of the record. A High Court exercising its power under Article 226 cannot act as an Executing Court. In our view, therefore, the order of the High Court and the tribunal are not sustain able in law.  Therefore, they are accordingly set aside. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The appeals are allowed.  No costs.","The selection list was publ ished on 3.12.1987.

No. 2499/91 for a decree of permanent injunction against appellant No.1. -2- The main issue, as noticed hereinbefore was the status of the appellant No.1.  The second issue evidently was as to whether the said P. Narasimhaiah executed the aforementioned will dated 5.11.1988 in favour of the appellant No.1 herein. Before the learned Trial Judge, all the suits were consolidated.  Parties adduced common evidence and the learned Trial Judge rendered a common judgment. Whereas O.S. No.6530/97  and O.S.

By reason of the impugned judgment dated 28.8.2006 the said first appeals were allowed. A bare perusal of the impugned judgment shows that the High Court did not consider all the aspects of the matter pertaining to the issues which arose between the parties. The reasonings of the learned Trial Judge have not been met. No question in terms of Order 41 Rule 31 was formulated. In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that in the interest of justice, t he matter should be directed to be heard afresh by the High Court and we order accordingly. -3- The impugned judgment is, therefore, set aside and the matters are remitted to the High Court for consideration thereof afresh.

1516," J U D G M E N T SANTOSH HEGDE, J. The respondents in the above 3 appeals were charged for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sheopuri, M.P. who by his judgment dated 8.9.1983 found the respondents guilty of the said offence and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life. On appeal, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur Bench at Gwalior partly allowed the appeal of the respondents and converted the conviction to one u/s. 304 (Part II) IPC, and sentenced them to imprisonment for the period already undergone. It is against this judgment of the High Court that the State is in appeal before us. In view of the peculiar facts of these appeals, it may not be necessary for us to deal in detail with the prosecution case. Suffice it to say that according to the prosecution the respondents having entertained certain enmity, attacked one Lachhu with an axe, iron rod and stones, consequent to which said Lachhu died. It is stated that Hari Lal, respondent in Crl.A. No.1290 attacked the deceased with an axe. Respondent in Crl.A. No.1291 Babu attacked with an iron rod while their mother, respondent in Crl.A. No.1292, Dukhia attacked the deceased with a stone. Because of the said attack, it is stated that the deceased suffered 5 injuries out of which injury No.1 was an incised injury wound, in the left perietal region, injury No.2 was a wound on the occipital bone, injury No.3 was a depressed fracture on the left perietal bone while injury Nos.4 and 5 were bruises on the arm and hip. The doctor had opined that injury Nos.1 and 2 were grievous and on post mortem it was found that they were the cause of death. The prosecution has examined nearly 24 witnesses. Learned Sessions Judge having discussed the entire evidence on record had come to the conclusion that the respondents were guilty of the offence alleged against them and had sentenced them as stated above, while the High Court has reduced the sentence to one u/s. 304, Part II, IPC. In these appeals, Mr. Dave, learned counsel appearing for the State, strongly contended that the High Court in its judgment had not given any special reasons for having come to the conclusion that the offence committed by the appellant was not one punishable u/s. 302 IPC but was one which is punishable u/s. 304, Part II, IPC. He copiously pointed out from the judgment of the trial court to substantiate his argument why the respondents should be held guilty of the offence u/s. 302 IPC. While we appreciate the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the High Court was extremely brief while discussing the evidence against the respondents and had hardly http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 given any reason for reducing the sentence from 302 to 304, Part II, IPC, we should bear in mind the fact that the incident in question had taken place as far back as on 11.10.1982 and from the records we find that by the time the High Court delivered its judgment, all the respondents had served more than 9 years of RI and even these appeals before us were filed in the year 1995 hence having perused the records, we think at this distance of time, that too when the respondents have served almost more than 9 years of imprisonment, we think it not equitable to entertain the argument of learned counsel for the State to upturn the judgment of the High Court assuming the same is erroneous.  We think substantial justice has been done. In the said view of the matter, we dismiss these appeals.","The respondents in the above 3 appeals were charged for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.

1517," JUDGMENT O R D E R (Arising out of SLP(C) NO. 5205/2006) Leave granted. Aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 10th January, 2006 passed by the High Court, this appeal is preferred by the Employer.  The respondent was dismissed from service by an order dated 27th April, 1988 preceded by an inquiry.  His writ petition was allowed by the High Court mainly on the ground of violation of the  principle of natural justice as no proper opportunity had been afforded to the respondent. The High Court, however, after setting aside the order of dismissal, gave the appell ant liberty to initiate a fresh inquiry but directed the payment of full back wages and reinstatement. The order of the High Court, in our view, is not in accordance with law settled by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of  Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad and Ors. vs. B Karunakar and Ors.  reported in 1993 (4) SCC 727.  The Constitution Bench of this Court considered a similar question in that case and held that the reinstatement of Government servants in such cases is for the purpose of making fresh inquiry.  While  inquiry is in progress,  he can ..2/- : 2 : be placed under suspension.  This Court also held that in such a situation the employee can only get subsistence allowance in accordance with law.  This Court further held that with regard to payment of back wages, it is subject to the result of the fresh inquiry, and therefore, no back wages can be directed to be paid at that stage. In view of the principle of law settled by this  Court  in the aforementioned case, the order of the High Court directing payment of back wages is not tenable in law and the same is set aside. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. We, however, observe that the inquiry may be expedited.","The respondent was dismissed from service by an order dated 27th April, 1988 preceded by an inquiry.

1518," J U D G M E N T SANTOSH HEGDE,J. This appeal is placed for final hearing before this Bench on a reference made by a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court. The question involved in this appeal pertains to the nature of enquiry to be conducted under Rule 4(2)(iii) of the Land Acquisition (Company) Rules, 1963. The referring Bench noticed a judgment of this Court in the case of Shyam Nandan Prasad & Ors. vs. State of Bihar & Ors. (1993 (4) SCC 255) which held that compliance of Rule (4) is not only mandatory but a notice of the said enquiry should also be given to the land owners concerned. The said judgment had noticed three earlier judgments of this Court in the case of State of Gujarat & Anr. vs. Patel Chaturbhai Narsibhai & Ors. (1975 (1) SCC 583), State of Gujarat & Ors. vs. Ambalal Haiderbhai & Ors. (1976 (3) SCC 495) and General Government Servants Cooperative Housing Society Ltd., Agra vs. Shri Wahab Uddin & Ors. (1981 (2) SCC 352) which also took similar views. The referring Bench, however, felt that though the enquiry under Rule (4) is mandatory, issuance of notice to the land owners of such enquiry is not mandatory, because they will anyway be heard in Section 5A (L.A Act) enquiry even in regard to the validity of the acquisition in favour of a company. It is in view of the above doubt entertained by the Division Bench the matter is referred to a larger Bench. So far as the judgments of this Court cited herein above are concerned, they do hold that Rule (4) is not only mandatory but that the notice of the said enquiry has to be given to the land owners. The above judgments, however, have not taken into consideration an earlier 5-Judge Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Babu Barkya Thakur vs. The State of Bombay & Ors. (1961 (1) SCR 128) wherein this Court indicated that all the requirements of Part VII of the Act especially Section 40 could be considered in Section 5A enquiry itself which would include all and any objection of the land owners including the objection in regard to the acquisition in favour of a company. This judgment of the 5-Judge Bench of this Court in our view seems to support the doubt entertained by the referring Bench. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and we are also of the opinion that since the objections that could possibly be raised in Rule (4) enquiry can also be raised in a Section 5A enquiry and in the absence of any specific requirement in Rule (4) as to the issuance of notice to the land owners of being heard in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 such an enquiry, hearing the land owners at the stage of Rule (4) enquiry would lead only to duplication and cause delay. Since the judgment of this Court in the case of State of Gujarat vs. Patel Chaturbhai Narsibhai (supra) and State of Gujarat vs. Ambalal Haiderbhai (supra) as also the judgment of General Government (supra) are judgments of 3-Judge Bench and the said Bench having not noticed the observations of this Court in the case of Babu Barkya Thakur (supra). We think it appropriate to refer this matter to a larger Bench.

The  Respondent  had challenged  his placement in this seniority list as prepared by  the Public Health Engineering Department, Government  of Rajasthan.   The  Respondent had in the petition inter  alia challenged the vires of Rule 28. The  Learned  Single  Judge,  by  an  Order  dated  21st September,  1999, made the Petition absolute by holding that the  controversy was covered by a judgment of this Court  in the  case  of  Vijay Singh Deora and Others  vs.   State  of Rajasthan and Another reported in 1997 (3) S.C.C.  118.  The learned  single Judge did not at all consider the effect  or validity of Rule 28, which reads as follows : ""Rule 28 :  - Seniority - Seniority of persons appointed to  the  lowest post of the Service or lowest categories  of posts  in  each of the group/section of the service, as  the case   may  be,  shall  be   determined  from  the  date  of confirmation  of  such  persons  to the said  posts  but  in respect  of  persons appointed by promotion to other  higher posts  in the service or other higher categories of posts in each  of  the group/section in the service, as the case  may be,  shall  be  determined from the date  of  their  regular selection to such posts."" In  Deora’s  case (supra) the applicability,  effect  or http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 validity of Rule 28 had not been dealt with at all.  In that case  seniority  was not fixed on basis of this  Rule.   The questions  raised  in this Writ Petition were therefore  not covered  by  that  decision.   The aspects  raised  in  this Petition should have been considered on merits.  The Learned Single  judge  did  not consider  them.

Notification  under   Section  4   [1]  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894 [for  short, the  ""Act""] acquiring  a large extent  of land  was published  on March  8, 1957.

Union  of India [LPA  No.81 of  1979 decided  on May  1, 1990] awarded compensation @  Rs.10/- per  square yard.  On appeal, it was confirmed. The  High Court relied upon a single sale deed in similar case  in which market value had been fixed @ Rs.12/- per square  yard. Therefore, the appellant also claimed that rate. Since  he was  not awarded the rate claimed by him, he has filed  appeal in  this Court  challenging  the  impugned judgment of the High Court. Shri  Juneja,   learned  counsel   for  the   appellant contended that  the High Court, having found that the market value of  the land  in question  could fetch was Rs.12/- per square yard,  would have  granted compensation at that rate. Though prima  facie we  find the  contention  plausible  and acceptable, in  view of  the legal  position that  at  least 1/3rd  of  the  market  value  has  to  be  deduced  towards development charges  and that the said consideration was not adopted in  the case  on which  reliance is placed, the fact boils down  that if  the award is to be interfered with, the appellant would  get less  than what has been granted to him by the  High Court.  However, since  the State has not filed any appeal  and in  the facts and circumstances of the case, we are  of the  view  that  it  is  not  a  case  warranting interference. The appeal under Section 54 of the Act would not lie to this Court.  A reading  of Section 54 would clearly indicate that the  appeal shall  lie in any proceedings under the act http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 only to  the High  Court against the award and decree of the reference Court  and further  appeal to  this Court would be under Article  136 of the Constitution read with Section 11, CPC. by way of special leave and not under Section 54 of the Act. Accordingly, this  appeal cannot  be treated  to be  an appeal under  Section 54 of the Act but one by special leave under Article 136. In either case, we do not find any ground warranting interference.  Hence the  appeal is dismissed.

In our view, there is no infirmity in the reasoning of the National Commission in directing that the alternate plot be given at the same price at which original plot was allotted.  However, we are unable to sustain the further direction that interest be paid by Appellants at the rate of 18% per annum.  As the Respondent/allottee is already benefited by getting an alternate plot at the old rate, there is no loss or damage being suffered by him which would automatically require such compensation.  In such cases, compensation for mental agony/harassment by awarding interest at the rate of 9% will be sufficient.  Of course, if an allottee proves that he has suffered a loss or damage e.g. having to stay in rental premises and pay rent, then such loss/damage can be awarded. In this case, there is no finding of any loss/damage.  We therefore modify the Order of the National Commission by awarding interest at the rate of 9% per annum.

1522," JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (3) SCR 214 The following Order of the Court was delivered: Leave granted in SLP No. 1457 of 1986. The respondents were granted mining leases under Rule 31 of the A.P. Mining Rules, 1966. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (for short ’the Central Act’) had come into force on October 25, 1980. Subsequently in terms of the grant of the lease the respondents applied for renewal. The State Government refused to grant renewal in view of the prohibition contained in Sec. 2 the Act. The respondents filed the writ petitions in the High Court and the Division Bench in the impugned Judgment dated June 9, 1982 directed to consider the renewal of the respondents and seek approval of the Central Government under Sec. 2 of the Act. Calling in question of the legality of the directions issued by the High Court these appeals by Special Leave have been filed. In some of the cases the application for renewal has been filed after the Act had come into force but on the question of law does not make much difference. The point raised is no longer res-integra. This Court in Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat & Ors., [1987] 1SCC 213, held that the public authority is vested with the power the expression ’may’ has been construed as ""shall’ because if the conditions for the exercise of the power are fulfilled, it is coupled with the duty. When the grant of renewal was sought to be made then the authority has been invested with the duty to grant of renewal. On the facts and circumstances in these cases specially in view of the prohibition contained in the Act renewal cannot be granted since the Act had come into force. So any grant of renewal should be consistent with the provisions contained in the Act. The purpose of the Act is Conservation of the Forest and to prevent the depletion of the forest. In other words the Act intended no only to protect the existing forest but also conserve forest and protection of the existing forest in accordance of the provisions of the Act. In view of the prohibition for grant of lease in the reserved forest area, grant of renewal in the face of the prohibited area will be in violation of law. Therefore, the authorities though had the power, but had duty while conserving the forest to refuse to grant renewal. In that view the Government’s refusal to grant renewal, therefore, cannot be said to be illegal. If they consider the renewal could be granted, even then the prior approval of the Central Government is mandatory under Sec. 2 of the Act. The renewal cannot be granted in view of the prohibition contained in the Act. Therefore, the direction issued by the High Court is clearly in violation of the Statute and on mandamus or direction could be issued to violate the mandatory provisions of the Act. The direction accordingly is illegal. The appeals are allowed the order of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside but in the circumstances without costs.","The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (for short ’the Central Act’) had come into force on October 25, 1980.

They were called by the respondents for counselling for the MBBS seats available in Azamgarh Medical College run by the All India Children Care & Educational Development Society, respondent in C.A.No.3237/1999.  They deposited the necessary fees and started attending the classes from July 12, 1999 and the 1st Professional examination was held in May 2000 and all of them have cleared their first professional.  When they came to join the 2nd professional course, they found that there were neither lab facilities nor sufficient teachers for teaching and conducting the course and practical classes for the 2nd professional.  However, on the assurances given to them at a parent-management meeting held on 25.7.2000 about providing adequate facilities, they joined the course. However, at this stage, it is pertinent to state that considering the fact that a large number students will be affected, this Court, in C.A.No. 3237/1999, gave the following directions by order dated 4.5.2001: ""Having perused the statements furnished by the College and the Medical Council of India and also the letter of the Director General of the Medical College of the State of U.P. in regard to compliance of requirements of 1993 Regulations, we are of the opinion that it would be just and appropriate to permit the College to start after making due arrangements, imparting institution to the existing students who have passed 1st year of the MBBS course within two weeks from today. The College shall be inspected by the Medical Council of India with reference to the deficiencies pointed out as per the standards fixed in 1993 Regulations in the first week of August 2001 after due notice to the applicant-respondent College.  The report whereof shall be submitted in this Court in the 2nd week of August 2001 by the MCI.  Further orders on the I.As will be passed on the basis of inspection report of MCI.  However, we make it clear that if the college does not come up to the standards fixed under 1993 Regulations, we http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 will be constrained to consider the question of ordering closure of the College and at that stage appropriate order for the absorption of the students in other colleges of Uttar Pradesh will be passed, if considered necessary.  We also make it clear that this arrangement is without prejudice to the contentions raised by the Medical Council of India in the appeal."" Inasmuch as, by our judgment in C.A.No.3237/1999 pronounced today, we have set aside the order made by the High Court holding that there is a deemed permission in favour of the respondent therein, and in the light of the order made by this Court on 4.5.2001 the said institution will have to be closed in the event of non-compliance of the directions issued by this Court, the career of the students is at jeopardy and this aspect cannot be seriously disputed.

The appellant  filed a  writ petition in the High Court seeking for a writ of mandamus directing the Commissioner of Police  or   the  appropriate   authority  to  transfer  his complaint dated  April 23,  1991  for  investigation  by  an independent police  agency other  than the local police. The High Court dismissed the writ petition summarily on November 3, 1992. Thus this appeal by Special Leave. We have  heard  the  learned  counsel  on  both  sides. Unfortunately the  appellant was done to death and the trial with regard  to  his  murder  is  pending  decision  in  the appropriate Sessions  Court. Therefore,  we need not go into the merits  in that behalf . The grievance of the appellant- Late  Sri  Kaptan  Singh  was  that  he  was  the  owner  of properties mentioned  in the writ petition; when he was kept in the  police custody  in connection with the crime imputed to him,  some person  holding himself  to be  his  power  of attorney was alienating his property and was including third parties into possession. In spite of his repeated complaints made to the authorities, after collusion of the local police in those  activities, no  action in that behalf was taken by the police  officer. It  would appear  that earlier  to  the complaint  made   by   the   petitioner-appellant   to   the Commissioner of  Police, the  local  police  seems  to  have investigated and  a report in that behalf was sent which now filed as  Annexure 1  & 2  to the counter affidavit sworn by one Alok  Kumar, D.C.P., South Delhi. It would indicate that the dispute  is one  of acute  disputed questions  of  fact. Under  these   circumstances,   we   cannot   satisfactorily adjudicate the  dispute in  this appeal. Therefore, we leave open  the   controversy  relegating  the  appellant’s  legal representative of  Sri  Kaptan  Singh  to  have  the  matter adjudicated  in   an  appropriate   forum.

The petitioner has filed this petition under Article 32 of the  Constitution  challenging  the  order  of  detention passed against  him under  Section 3 (1) of the COFEPOSA Act 1974. The  order is challenged on three grounds, namely, (1) there was delay in passing the detention order (2) there was delay in  execution of the detention order and (3) a copy of the written proposal made by the sponsoring authority to the detaining authority was not supplied to the petitioner. It is  not necessary  to state the facts leading to the of the  detention order  as we  are inclined  to allow  this petition on  the second  ground raised  by  Mr,  K.K.  Mani, learned counsel  for the  petitioner. The order of detention was passed  on 14.3.1996. The petitioner came to be detained on 7.8.1997. The contention raised by Mr. Mani is that there was undue  delay in  execution of the order and that clearly indicates that there was no genuine satisfaction on the part of the  detaining authority    regarding  the  necessity  of immediate detention  of the  petitioner in  order to prevent him from committing and continuing to commit the prejudicial activity alleged  against him.  In reply  to this contention raised by  the petitioner what the detention order could not be executed immediately as the petitioner was absconding. In paragraph 12  of the  counter affidavit  filed by  the Joint Secretary to the Government of India it is stated as under: "" Continuous  efforts were  made by the State  Police on  the following dates to apprehend the detenue- 25.04.1996, 20.05.1996, 30.06.1996, 23.07.1996, 28.08.1996, 24.09.1996, 15.10.1996, 26.11.1996, 18.12.1996, &  20.12.1996,   17.1.97,  27.2.97, 26.3.97, 26.3.97,  24.4.97, 29.6.97 and 7.8.97. But for  the sustained  efforts  by the Police  authorities at  Nagore, he would  not have been apprehended now."" The joint  Secretary has  not explained why not attempt http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 was made  from 14.3.96  to 25.4.96  to apprehend the detenue and put  him under detention even though the detention order was passed  on 14.3.96.  It further  appears that on attempt was  made   to  see  that  the  petitioner  was  immediately apprehended. No  serious efforts were made by the Police had tried to  find out  the petitioner.  It is  also not  stated where they  looked for  him and  what inquiries were made to find out  his whereabouts.  The Joint  Secretary himself had made no  effort to  find out from the Police authority as to why they  were not  able to  apprehend him and yet they were not successful in finding him out. There is also no material to show  that the  detaining authority  had made any serious attempt during this whole period of delay to find out if the detention order  remains unexplained. The unreasonable delay in executing the order creates a serious doubt regarding the genuineness  of  the  detaining  authority  as  regards  the immediate necessity  of detaining the petitioner in order to prevent from  carrying on  the prejudicial activity referred to in  the grounds  of detention. We are of the opinion that the order of detention was passed by the detaining authority not in  lawful exercise  of the  power vested  in  him.  We, therefore, allow  this petition,  set aside  and  quash  the order of  detention and direct that the petitioner be set at liberty forthwith unless his presence is required in jail in connection with any other case.",The order of detention was passed  on 14.3.1996.

1533," J U D G M E N T With Crl. Appeal No. 687 of 2006 Crl. Appeal No. 688 of 2006 ALTAMAS KABIR,J. I have had the privilege of going through the judgment prepared by my  learned  brother  and  I fully agree with the reasoning and the ultimate decision rendered therein.  I would, however, like to dilate on one of the points urged by Ms. Jaiswal, which has been briefly touched upon in the judgment. It has been submitted that the statutory provisions of Section 389 (3) Cr.P.C.,  has  an overriding  effect over the Supreme Court Rules and hence once bail has been granted to a convicted person by the trial court, this Court cannot insist that  he should surrender to the sentence in terms of Rule 13A before his appeal can be registered. While such a submission is attractive, it does not stand  scrutiny for the simple reason that  Sub-section (3) of Section 389, Cr.P.C.  empowers the trial court to release a  convicted person on bail for such period as will afford him sufficient time to present an appeal and obtain  orders of the Appellate Court under Sub-section (1) , namely, release  on bail, and it is only for such  period that the sentence of imprisonment shall be deemed to be suspended. The basic fallacy of Ms. Jaiswal’s  submission is that it overlooks  the question that   grant of bail in the appeal presupposes  surrender by  the convicted person . The provisions of Section 389 Cr.P.C. and that of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966,  are independent  provisions and will have to be considered on their own standing. The appeals can, therefore, be posted only after the appellants surrender and proof of surrender is filed.","Altamas KABIR, J.S. says he fully agrees with the reasoning and the ultimate decision rendered therein.

No.4017 are sufficient for disposal of these appeals. The facts  are that  on July  16, 1979,  certain  lands situated in  Kutiyana Tehsil  & District  Sirsa were sold by Mathri, Dilawar  and Santosh  Kumar  to  the  appellants  by registered sale  deed dated  June 16,  1979. The  respondent filed Suit  No.581/80 in  the Court of Sub Judge, Ist Class, Sirsa under  Section 15(l)(b) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913 on  July 18,  1980 for  preemption of the land from the appellants on the premise that the lands originally belonged to one  Shri Ram who died in the year 1944. His widow Dhapan had remained  in possession as Widow’s Estate. She cannot be said to have inherited the property through her husband. She had no  right to  sell the  lands to  the appellants  as she remained limited  owner. Therefore, being a co-owner of Shri Ram, the  respondent is  entitled to preemption of the lands sold by  Dhapan to the appellants. Accepting  the contention of the  respondent, the  trial Court  decreed the  suit.  On appeal, it  was confirmed. Second appeal was dismissed. Thus these appeals  by special  leave. Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act,  1956 enlarges  the widows’  estate known to sastric law;  removed the  fetters on possession and blossom into an  absolute right to the widow. Pending appeals, the Haryana Pre-emption Amendment Act, 1995 fact No.10 of 1995) came into force w.e.f July 7, 1995. The question arises: whether the respondents are entitled to pre-emption. This  controversy was  considered by this Court Karan Singh  & Ors.  v. Bhagwan Singh (Dead) by L.Rs. & Ors. [C.A. @  SLP (C)  Nos.14362 & 14372 of 1986] decided on 24th January, 1996  by a  Bench of which two of us [K.Ramaswamy & G.B. Pattanaik, JJ.] were members. Therein, it was held that the appeal  was continuation  of original  proceedings. When http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the appellate court has season of the whole case, the entire controversy would  be at  large and  the issue would be open for reconsideration.  Thus the  whole case  is at large. For the purpose  of pre-emption,  the right  and remedy  must be available not  only on  the date of the sale but also on the date of  the suit  as well as on the date when the decree is made and is finally to be affirmed or need to be modified at the time  of the disposal of the appeal. Since the appeal is a continuation  of the  original proceedings,  the right and the remedy  should  continue  to  subsist  till  this  Court decides the  controversy, if  the appeal is presented and is pending disposal.  Since the  statute had intervened and the Act has taken away the right of pre-emption of the co-owners and confined  the right  and remedy  to be only in favour of the tenants,  the  respondents  have  lost  their  right  of preemption. In  other words, co-owners’ right of pre-emption has   been   taken   away   by   amendment   to   the   Act. Consequentially,  the   respondents  have  lost  the  right, pending the  appeals. This  Court under  Section 57  of  the Indian Evidence  Act shall  take judicial  notice of all the laws in  force in  the territory  of India.  The Court would take judicial  notice of  the Acts  of State Legislature and the Parliament.  Accordingly, taking notice of the change in law the  right end  remedy to the respondent have been lost. As a result, the suit for pre-emption is not maintainable. The main  appeal  as  well  as  connected  appeals  are accordingly  allowed.   Consequentially,  the   suits  stand dismissed. But, in the circumstances, without costs.","On July 16, 1979, certain lands situated in Kutiyana Tehsil & District Sirsa were sold by Mathri, Dilawar and Santosh Kumar to the appellants.

His  report is like that of  a clerk  putting up  the  rote  and  nothing  more. However, we  have carefully  gone through the record annexed to the  report.

In fact,  the Vice-Chairman also  had pointed  out time  and again in that behalf. He had also issued notice to have the school vacated and the  park preserved.

As noticed earlier, the Letters Patent Appeal is still pending in the High Court.  The State has questioned the correctness of the directions issued by the learned Single Judge in the  Letters Patent Appeal.  In the meanwhile, the learned Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 directed the State to deposit the wages of the respondent in accordance with the terms of Minimum Wages Act from January, 1992 to ending March, 2006 and pay the said amount to the respondent within two weeks from 03.04.2006.  The said direction to pay the amount to the respondent within two weeks pending disposal of the Letters Patent Appeal, in our opinion, is not warranted at this stage.  However, we are not inclined to set aside the direction issued by the Division Bench directing the State to deposit the wages of the respondent in accordance with the terms of Minimum Wages Act from January, 1992 to ending March, 2006. Therefore, we give further time to the State by four weeks to comply with the direction in regard to the deposit of the minimum wages.  The said amount shall be deposited with the Registrar General of the High Court subject to the final outcome of the Letters Patent Appeal.  On such deposit, the Registrar General is directed to invest the same in a short term fixed deposit in a nationalised bank. We request the High Court to dispose of the Letters Patent Appeal within three months from the date of receipt of this Order from this Court or on production of the same by either party.

The admitted position  is   that  there   being  a   dispute  as  to  the apportionment of  the compensation,  the  Collector  made  a reference under  s.30 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, ’the  Act’) and  the Reference Court formed the point thus : ""Who among the claimants are entitled to receive compensation  and to what extent ?"" The Civil  Court, while  apportioning the  compensation among the  claimants, awarded  interest 9%  per annum on the amount of  compensation. When  it was  challenged  in  Civil Revision Petition No. 1148/87 dated March 10, 1987, the High Court confirmed  the same following a judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High  Court Purushotham  Haridas &  Ors. Vs.  Amruth Ghee Co. Ltd., Guntur & Ors. [AIR 1961 AP 143]. The questions  is whether the view of the High Court is correct. Section  11 of  the  Act  provides  that  the  Land Acquisition  Officer   shall  enquire  into  the  respective interests of  the persons claiming, compensation or believed to have  an interest  therein and  shall make  an award; and under clause  (iii) of  sub-section (1)  apportion the  said compensation among  all persons  known  or  believed  to  be interested  in   land  of  whom  or  whose  claims,  he  has information  in   whether  or  not  they  have  respectively appeared before him. Under Section  30  of  the  Act,  when  the  amount  of compensation has  been settled  under s.11,  if any  dispute arises as  to the  apportionment of  the same  or  any  part thereof or  as to  the persons  to whom the same or any part thereof is  payable, the Collector may refer such dispute to the decision  of the Court. Under sub-section (2) of Section http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 31, if  there is  any dispute  as to  apportionment  of  the compensation, the  Collector shall  deposit  the  amount  of compensation, in  the Court to which reference under Section 18 would be submitted. Thus, if could be seen that on making award under s.11, the Collector is enjoined to make a reference under s.30, if there is  any dispute  as to  the person entitled to receive the compensation  and the  apportionment thereof.  On making such reference, the Collector is further enjoined under s.31 to deposit  the amount  of the  compensation in the Court to which reference  under s.18  would be  submitted.  In  other words, on  deposit of  the amount into the court and pending decision of the reference, the liability of the State to pay interest thereon  ceases with  effect from  the date  of the deposit. Therefore,  the Reference Court as well as the High Court committed  an obvious  illegality in directing payment of interest  at 9% on the amount from the date of deposit by the Collector till the decision of the reference court under s.30. The  decision of  the High  Court of Andhra Pradesh is clearly illegal. The appeal  is accordingly allowed and the direction to pay interest is set aside.",The appeal  is accordingly allowed and the direction to pay interest is set aside.

1538," O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment of the single Judge  of the  Madras High Court made on November 16, 1996 in Second Appeal No.1234/95. Admittedly,  the   appellant  and  the  respondent  are brothers. They  inherited the  property consisting  of three floors in  Salainagar Koil  Street, Madras.  It would appear that as per the partition deed the ground floor was required to be  enjoyed by both the parties. The partition deed dated August 27,  1953 does  disclose that  the appellant  and the respondent have  to enjoy  the  property  in  equal  shares. Though the  recitals of  the partition deed were not happily worded,  the   fact  remains   that  the  respondent  is  in possession of first floor and the appellant is in possession of second  floor. It  is not  disputed that the ground floor was converted  into shops and the appellant is in possession of one  portion and  the respondent  in two portions through tenants. The question, therefore, is in what manner the property are required  to be  enjoyed in equal shares? The High Court relying  upon   the  recitals  in  the  partition  deed  had concluded  that   the  ground  floor  was  allotted  to  the appellant while  the first and second floor were allotted to the respondent.  Consequently, it  reversed the judgment and decree of  the appellate  Court and  confirmed that  of  the trial Court.  On perusal  of the partition deed, it is clear that the  view of  the High Court is not correct. It is seen that the ground floor was allotted to both the appellant and the respondent  for common  enjoyment and  first  floor  was allotted to  one party  and second  floor  was  allotted  to another  party.   First  floor   is  in  the  possession  of respondent consisting  of 532  sq.ft. with  four rooms while admittedly the  second floor consisted of one room with open terrace. Under these circumstances, the property is required to be  enjoyed by  the brothers  in  equal  shares  and  re- partition is  required to  be done  in accordance  with  the available  rooms   and  property   situation.  Under   these circumstances, the  judgments and decrees of the High Court, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 appellate Court  and the  trial Court  stand set  aside. The trial Court  is directed to appoint an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the area and work out the partition in such a way where both  the parties  would enjoy  the property  in equal share. The matter is remitted to the trial Court. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The trial Court would do the exercise within a period of six months from the date of receipt of this Court’s order.

This appeal is filed against the final judgment and order dt.06.04.2006 of the Divis ion Bench of the High Court of Guwahati in Writ Appeal No.614 of 2005 allowing the Writ Appeal filed by the respondents and rejecting the plea of the appellant to set aside the order of termination which was passed in the year 1991 along with the order passed on 14.05.2001.  Th e learned Single Judge while allowing the Writ Petition made the following observations : ""8.  In view of the aforesaid discussions, this case is disposed of with a direction that the respondent authority shall take steps immediately to provide an appropriate relief to the petitioner like Mr.Santosh Kumar Rao as provided in the order dated 14.5.2001.  Since the petitioner is not in service as Junior Engineer as on date and there is also no interim order passed by this Court in this case, the petitioner will not be entitled for any back wages.  The aforesaid direction shall be completed within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order to be submitted by the petitioner."" Feeling aggrieved by the said order, the respondent filed a Writ Appeal before the D ivision Bench of the High Court.  In the said appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court had not g one practically into the merits of the Writ Petition but allowed the Writ Appeal on the ground t hat since the appellant had not challenged the order of termination which was passed in the year 1991, the appellant was not entitled to claim any relief.  Feeling aggrieved, the appellant had filed the present appeal by way of Special Leave Petition. Mr.P.K.Goswami, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant contende d that the Division Bench without looking into the prayers made in the Writ Appeal and the rel iefs claimed therein, had allowed the appeal of the respondent on the ground that the Writ Petiti on was filed by the appellant after 11 years of the order of termination. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and after going into the impugned orde r of the Division Bench as well as the learned Single Judge of the High Court, we are of the view http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that the Division Bench had failed to consider that the Writ Petition which was filed by the appe llant was not only challenging the order of termination of 1991 but also the order dt.14.05.2001. The learned Single Judge relying upon the order dt.14.05.2001 had given the same relief as was g iven to one Mr.Santosh Kumar Rao.  It is true that the order of termination was not set aside by the learned Single Judge.  However, it is also an admitted position that before the learned Sing le Judge the  question  of  limitation was not even raised by the parties. In that view of the matter, we are of the view that the impugned order should be set aside and the matter may be sent back to the Division Bench of the High Court to decide the same o n merits and in accordance with law.  Accordingly, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.  The Division Bench of the High Court is requested to decide the appeal on merits preferably within three months from the date of communication of this Order.

1543," J U D G M E N T B.L. Hansaria, This appeal  was once  heard earlier  and in  the order passed on  25th September,  1995 it  was stated  that as the High Court  in the  impugned  judgment  has  relied  on  the earlier pronouncement  by Division  Bench of  the same  High Court in Krishan Kumar’s (Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 3073 of 1977),  it would  be appropriate to peruse that judgment, which being not on record a direction was given to place the same for  our perusal.  It has  been so  done. We  have gone through the  judgment and,  according  to  us,  the  learned single Judge who rendered impugned judgment misread the view taken by the Division Bench in Krishan Kumar’s case. In that judgment, the  Division Bench  has really  held that section 38-B was  wide enough to ""capture finding or decisions given under the  Ceiling Act  as well prior to the commencement of section 38-B"".  It has  really not  been held  in  that case that ""in  the subsequent  ceiling proceedings,  the  earlier finding would  be binding unless it can  be shown that after the  earlier   ceiling  proceedings  there    occurred  some amendments in the Ceiling Act which justified that reopening of a finding recorded in the earlier ceiling proceedings"" as observed in  the impugned  judgment.  No  doubt  in  Krishan Kumar’s case  as argument was advanced to cut down the width of section  38-B by  inviting the  attention of the Bench to section 31(5); the Bench, however, held that the section had no impact on the applicability of section 38-B. In view  of the  above, the  view taken in the impugned judgment cannot be upheld. The same is, therefore, set aside and   the decision  of the  Prescribed Authority rendered on 29th June,  1976, which  was affirmed by the Appellate Court by its  judgment dated  July 25,  1977 is restored. The High Court’s remand order has, therefore, no leg to stand. The appeal  is allowed  accordingly, in  the facts  and circumstances of the case, we  make no order as to costs.","The High Court’s remand order has, therefore, no leg to stand.

The  respondent   has  filed   a  suit   for   specific performance and  after the  evidence of  the  appellant  was closed on  12.3.1991,  the defendant’s evidence was directed to be recorded on 20.3.1991. It would appear that the matter was adjourned  from tine  to time  till 11.1.1994.  On  that date, the  respondent seemed to have declined to contest the suit and sought adjournment. The application for adjournment was rejected  and  after  hearing  arguments,  judgment  was reserved and  was pronounced  on 14.1.1994.  Respondent No.2 made an application on 27.1.94 to set aside the decree under Order 9  Rule 13 CPC. Similar application was filed by other respondents.  While   that  application   was  pending,  the appellant   moved    an   application   objecting   to   the maintainability of  the application  and to  hear  it  as  a preliminary point. That petition came to be dismissed by the trial  Court   on  7.10.95.  Against  the  said  order,  the appellant  filed   writ  petition  under  Art.  226  of  the Constitution and  that was  dismissed by  the impugned order dated 21.12.95  by the  High  Court.

The learned counsel  sought for  and the  matter was  adjourned. Thus it has come up today. The appellant’s counsel contended that three remedies are open to the appellant under the CPC, namely, right  of appeal  under section  96 or  appeal under Order 43  read with  section 104 or a revision under section 115 CPC.  In view  of the fact that the matter does not come within the  four corners  of any  of the three remedies, the appellant is  left with  no other  remedy except approaching the High  Court under  Art.226. It is true that the impugned order is not appealable one either under section 96 or under http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Order 43  Rule 1  read with  section 104  CPC. But  still  a revision would  be maintainable  and whether the order could be revised  or not  is a matter to be considered by the High Court on merits. But instead of availing of that remedy, the appellant has  invoked jurisdiction  under Art.226  which is not warranted  and the  procedure prescribed  under the  CPC cannot  be   bye--passed  by  availing  of  the  remedy  not maintainable under  Article 226.  Under these circumstances, we decline  to interfere  with the  order, it is open to the appellant to avail of such remedy as is open under law. The appeal is accordingly dismissed .

In the rejoinder,  it is admitted by the appellant in paragraph 8 which reads as under : ""It is  true that  I had let out to one Jasmine  Electricals, but  that is only  from 1993 and not earlier. It is  totally incorrect  to  state that I  have been   realising   the rental  income  from  the  property since 1968."" The admission  thereby that he has let out the premises gets proved.

The appellant  challenged,  along  with  yet  other  batch,  the validity of the notification published under Section 4(1) on October 12,  1974 and  declaration  under  Section  6  dated September 28,  1974 contending  that the  declaration  under Section 6  could not  be made  until the  notification under Section  4(1)   was  published   in  accordance   with  law. Therefore, the  notification is  bad in law.  The High Court noted, as  a fact,  that the notification under Section 4(1) and the  declaration under  Section  6  were  simultaneously published on  October 12,  1974.   There is  no bar  no  the Government making  the  order  that  before  publication  of Section 4(1)  declaration under  Section 6  should  also  be published.   It is  not in  dispute that  the State  had  in exercise of its power of eminent domain under Section 17 [4] of the Act, dispensed with the enquiry under Section 5A.  It is  settled   law  that   simultaneous  publication  of  the notification under  Section 4(1)  and the  declaration under Section 6 was valid in law prior to the coming into force of the Amendment  Act 68  of 1984.   It  is also  seen that  in relation to  the State  of Uttar  Pradesh, Land  Acquisition [Amendment] Act 5 of 1991 has been brought into force w.e.f. February 17,  1991 and,  therefore, in relation to the State of U.P.  it is now settled law that when the State exercises the power  of eminent  domain and  in exercise  of the power under  Section  17(4)  dispensing  with  the  enquiry  under Section 5-A to acquire the land under Section 4(1) the State is entitled  to have the notification under Section 4(1) and the declaration  under Section 6 simultaneously published so as to  take further steps as required under Section 9 of the Act, i.e.,  issuance of  the notice  and  taking  possession thereof under  Section 17(2)  of the  Act.   Thereafter, the land stands  vested in the State free from all encumbrances. In view  of the  urgency, the  Government exercised power of eminent domain  and dispensed with the enquiry under Section 5-A; we  do not  find any  illegality in the action taken by the respondents  in having  the notification  under  Section http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 4(1) and  the declaration  under  Section  6  simultaneously published.   It is  then sought  to be  contended  that  the appellant has  a small  extent of  the land  and other lands have been  excluded from  acquisition and,  therefore, it is arbitrary exercise  of power.   He also seeks to contend the procedural  infirmities,   but  unfortunately  none  of  the contentions have  been pressed before the High Court, though might have  been raised  in  writ  petition.    Under  those circumstances, we  cannot permit  the  appellants  to  argue these points afresh which are purely questions of fact to be verified on  the basis  of the  material as the State had no opportunity to deal with them.

One Roopa  had a  few sons  which  included  Sadda  and Dallu. In  the line  of Sada,  there occasioned an adoption. The adopted person was Puran. That adoption was questionable at the instance of the reversioners existing in the lines of the  other   sons.  The  gripping  parties  in  the  instant litigation not only involves Puran (the adopted son) but the reversioners in  the line  of Dallu, and those are Birbal, a great grandson  of Dallu;  Aaidah -  a grandson of Dallu and Nathu -  another  great  grandson  of  Dallu.  When  puran’s adoptive mother  gifted some  ancestral land  to a  stranger then Nathu was in his mother’s womb but the other two namely Birbal and  Aaidan were  existent,  Nathu  after  birth  and coming of age claimed that he had limitation to question the gift by the adoptive mother of Puran as also the adoption of Puran and  thus filed a suit claiming properties of Sadda by reversion arraying  Puran as  the  principal  defendant  and Birbal and Aaidan as interested defendants; besides arraying some  others  including  some  reversionary  as  defendants. Apparently, at a point of time, Nathu-plaintiff got in terms with puran  and on  settling the  matter with  him  made  an application to  the Trial Court on 25-10-1975 for withdrawal of the suit. On the very same day, allegedly priorly, Birbal and Aaidan  the defendants who shared interests of reversion with Nathu, prayed for being transposed as plaintiffs to the suit, It  is in  this situation  that the  Trial  Court  was confronted with  the riddle as to which application deserved disposal first,  i.e, the  application for withdrawal of the suit  or   the  application   for  transposition   of  those defendants as  plaintiffs. It  by a  set of reasoning, opted for the  transposition first  and the  withdrawal later  and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 thus   kept the suit survived but the High Court reversed it in revision  putting the  withdrawal  application  first  in priority,  rendering   the  application   for  transposition redundant, dismissing the suit as withdrawn, It is this view of the High Court which is under challenge. It is undisputed that per se neither Aaidan nor Birbal, the interested  defendants in  the suit,  had any  surviving right to  sue because  the period of limitation qua them had run out.  The extended period of limitation, which Nathu had on account  of his  being in  the womb  of his mother on the date when limitation started, was personal to him and nobody could  under  his  shedow  claim  extension  of  limitation, standing apparently  on opposite  sides. It  would not  have made the  slightest difference  if the  interests  of  these three were treated common because concededly Nathu alone had the extended  right to  sue and  Birbal  and  Aaidan,  Their capacity to  sue had  to be  viewed  separately.  Since  the factum of  Nathu being  the plaintiff  by itself  could  not extend the period of limitation for Birbal and Aaidan, their transposition would  not have  conferred on  them any better capacity or  right. In  such a  situation it  would not have made  the  slightest  difference  as  to  which  application deserved priority  in disposal as both could have been taken up together,  and the  end-result in  any event,  would have been to  hold that  Birbal and Aaidan could not on their own file or  pursue the  suit, even  if transposed as plaintiffs which had  to  be  dismissed  being  beyond  the  period  of limitation. In this   view  of the  matter, we  do not think it appropriate to  interfere in  the orders  of the High Court. The appeal  therefore fails  and  is  hereby  dismissed.

The question arose:  whether those  persons who  retired  before April 1,1990  are also  entitled, to  be brought  within the pension  scheme?   Admittedly,  they  are  governed  by  the contributory provident  fund scheme  and on retirement, they had withdrawn the was in vogue earlier. The petitioners that the writ  petitions in    the high court contending that the prescription of  a  cut-off  date,  i.e.  April  1,1990  was arbitrary, and  denying them  the benefit  of the pensionary scheme is  violative of  Article 14 of the constitution. The sham Das  Sharma Vs.  State of  Punjab  dismissed  the  writ petitions.

[JT 1996 (2) SC 463],  the cut  off date  is arbitrary  ; the  pensionary benefits should  be extended  to the  retirees prior  to the cut off  date; otherwise,  it violates  Article  14  of  the constitution. we find no force in the contention. It is true that the  pension is not a bounty but a right  earned by the persons while in the service. But unfortunately the pensions scheme was  not in  vogue prior  to the  retirement  of  the petitioners   the pension  scheme came  to be introduced for the first  time with  effect  from  April  1,1990  and  July http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 28,1994 the  date on  which   the scheme was extended to the non-provincialised employees.  In other  words, all  of them have been treated as a class and no invidious discrimination have been  treated has meted out to them . Thus, the date of April 1,1990  bears rationality,  namely, the scheme for the first time  was introduced on that date. All those employees who retired  prior to that date were  treated as a class and the scheme was extended to it Thus, we find that there is no illegality in  introducing the  cut-off date;  not  does  it violates Article 14.

We are  satisfied  that this is a case where on the  facts  now placed  before  us, bail should be  granted  The  principles bearing  on  grant  or refusal of  bail  have  already  been explained by this Court in Gurcharan Singh & Ors. vs.  State http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 (Delhi Admn.) On the basis of that decision this is  clearly a case where the appellant is entitled to bail.  Two grounds have  been  mentioned on behalf of the  State,  namely,  the appellant’s  presence is necessary for making a  search  and recovery  of  certain documents.

The other (1)  [1782] S.C.R.358. 130 ground  that is put forward is the appellant’s  presence  is required by the police for interrogation in connection  with investigation.   We make it clear that the  appellant  shall appear  for interrogation by the police whenever  reasonably required,  subject to her right under Article 20(3)  of  the Constitution. We allow the appeal and direct the appellant to be  enlarged on bail on condition that she, with two sureties, will enter into  a-bond  in a sum of Rs. 5,000/- and she  will  subject herself  to  condition for appearing before the  Police  for interrogation  if  called  upon  to do  so  subject  to  the condition  under Article 20(3).

Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dismissing the application filed by the appellants. 3.      Challenge in the petition before the High Court was to the order passed by a learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, Tis Hazari Court, dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition filed by the appellants. 4.      Grievances in short were that one M/s Habib Investments Ltd. incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956 (in short the ’Act’) advertised  in various newspapers inviting the general public to subscribe in various Fixed Deposits and saving schemes. Since the schemes were very lucrative, many innocent persons subscribed to the schemes. Various persons were appointed as agents on commission basis to collect the money from subscribers. Many people who were to get money complained of cheating stating that on the date of maturity, the certificates issued were not honoured. First Information Report was lodged with the Police Station, Lahori Gate, Delhi. Initially, the application was filed for appointment of Receiver in respect of M/s Habib Group of Companies and to make an order to attach the properties. Five properties were attached. A public notice was issued by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate directing attachment of the properties. Grievance was made that notwithstanding the order of attachment the properties were either disposed of or dealt with in a manner contrary to the order of attachment. 5.      The learned Additional District and Sessions Judge rejected the application filed by the appellants on the ground that they had no locus standi to file a revision petition. The High Court by a single line order dismissed the petition filed before it. 6.      During the course of hearing of the appeal, it was submitted by the non official respondents that they are willing http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 to dispose off the properties to meet the demands of the creditors. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that after having violated various orders passed, one of the non- official respondents has now come to dispose off the properties to meet the demands of creditors and to wipe out the liabilities. Ultimately, the people who are the creditors have to get back their money. Without entering into the matters relating to the commission of contempt, it would be appropriate for the concerned Court to work out the modalities as to how the properties can be sold to get the highest price so that the dues of the creditors and the liabilities can be discharged. 7.      Accordingly, we dispose of the appeal directing the concerned Court to work out the details and the modalities after hearing learned counsel for the parties so that the amounts due to various persons towards creditors and liabilities to be discharged, can be paid. 8.

The impugned order reads thus  : ""This is  an application to condone the delay  of 565 days in filing an appeal.   The petition is seriously opposed by  the  respondent.

That apart,  we find  that in  the application filed by the respondent  seeking condonation  of delay, the thrust in explaining the delay after 12.5.1995, si: ""at   that    time   the   Advocate General’s office was fed up with so many  arbitration  matters  equally important to this case were pending for  consideration   as   per   the directions of  the Advocate General on 2.9.1995."" This  can   hardly  be   said  to   be  a   reasonable, satisfactory  or  even  a  proper  explanation  for  seeking condonation of delay.  In the reply filed to the application seeking condonation  of delay  by the  appellant in the High Court, it is asserted that after the judgment and decree was pronounced by  the learned  Sub Judge, Kollam on 30.10.1993, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the scope  for filing  of the  appeal was  examined  by  the District  Government   Pleader,  Special  Law  Officer,  Law Secretary and  the Advocate  General and  in accordance with their opinion,  it was  decided that  there was no scope for filing the  appeal but lateron, despite the opinion referred to above,  the appeal  was filed  as  late  as  on  8.1.1996 without disclosing  why it  was being filed.  The High Court does not  appear to  have examined  the reply  filed by  the appellant as  reference to  the same  is conspicuous  by its absence from  the order.   We  are not satisfied that in the facts and  circumstances of this case, any explanation, much less a  reasonable or  satisfactory one  had been offered by the respondent State for condonation of the inordinate delay of 565 days. Law of limitation may harshly effect a particular party but it  has to  be applied  with all  its  rigour  when  the statute so  prescribe and the Courts have no power to extend the  period   of  limitation  on  equitable  grounds.

In the  year 1994, respondent No.3, Syed Zuhara Jabeen, was posted  as Chief  Education officer,  Pulwama, When  the State Government,  on the  allegations  that  she  committed number of  irregularities, mal-practices and misappropriated Government funds,  by an order dated 5.10.1994 withdrew from her  the  drawing  and  disbursing  power.  Respondent  No.3 challenged the said order by means of a Writ petition before the High Court which was dismissed. In the  meantime certain  more irregularities committed by respondent  No.3 came  to light with the result the State Government by an order dated 11.2.1997 attached her with the Directorate of  School Education,  Kashmir, and  posted  the appellant as Chief Education Officer, Pulwama in his own pay and grade.  Consequent upon  the said  order, the  appellant assumed charge  and started  functioning as  Chief Education officer, Pulwama.  As soon  as respondent  No.3 learnt  that Government is  joint to  transfer her and post the appellant in her  place, she  filed another  writ  petition  (SWP  No. 216/97 ) before the High Court and obtained an interim order dated 4.2.1997  directing the  State Government to allow her to continue  as Chief  Education Officer,  Pulwama, till the said post  is filled up by the Department in accordance with the rules.  Aggrieved by  the said order the appellant filed an appeal  (LPA (SW)  106/97] against  the grant  of interim order. A Division Bench of the High Court by its order dated 12.31997 stayed the operation of the interim order passed by the learned  Single Judge. Subsequently, upon an application filed by respondent No. 3, the High Court by its order dated 22.4.97, after  vacating the said interim order has directed the Government  not to post the appellant as Chief Education http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 officer. That  is how  this appeal  has come  up before this Court. A perusal  of record  shows  that  there  were  serious charges against  respondent No.3  and her continuance on the post of Chief Education officer was found detrimental to the public interest  and, as  such, the  Government attached her with the  Directorate of  School Education,  Kashmir pending inquiry against  her and the appellant, who was then working as Deputy  chief Education  officer,  was  posted  as  Chief Education  Officer.   This  was  by  way  of  administrative arrangement. Otherwise also, the appellant being next in the order of  seniority was  entitled  to  be  posted  as  Chief Education officer.  On the  other hand,  respondent No.3 was transferred to  Directorate in her own pay and grade and she was not  put to  any financial  loss and  her  stay  in  the Directorate was  till completion  of  inquiry  against  her. Under such  circumstances, the  High Court was not justified in directing  the government  not to  post the  appellant as Chief Education  Officer. While  passing the impugned order, the High  Court did  not consider  whether prima  facie  the appellant is  entitled to be post as Chief Education Officer Keeping in  view the principle of seniority-cum-suitability. In fact, the principles governing the grant of interim order were not  kept in  regard by  the High Court while directing that the  appellant be  not appointed  to the  post of Chief Education officer.

In  view   of  the  settled  legal  position  that  the disciplinary authority, on the basis of the magnitude of the misconduct,  is   empowered   to   impose   the   punishment appropriate to  the situation, the High Court is unjustified in interfering  with the  punishment of  reversion, as  most lenient view  was taken by the Government.

The  admitted   position  is  that  the  Haryana  Seeds Development  Corporation  Ltd.  has  been  carrying  on  the business of  distribution of  the certified varieties of the crop seeds  to the  farmers during  Rabi and  Kharif  sowing seasons. As  a consequence,  a number of employees including the salesman  like the  respondents came to be appointed. It is also  on record that due to heavy flood etc., a number of units including  the seeds  sales counter  were closed. As a consequence,  the   services  of  the  employees  have  been dispensed with. The respondent have sought a reference under Section 10(1)(c)  of the  Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 [for short,  the   ""Act""].  The   Labour  Court   held  that  the dispensation of  the services  of the respondents amounts to retrenchment within  the meaning of Section 25-F of the Act. As a  result without  giving one month’s notice or salary in lieu thereof,  the retrenchment  is bad in law. Accordingly, it passed  the award  which was  affirmed by the High Court. Thus, appeals by special leave. Section 25-FFF  of the Act regulates the closure of the industry which envisages as under :- ""25-FFF.

As a  consequence  of  the  closure  of  the  industry, Section 25-F  of the  Act is  not attracted  and the  rigour imposed thereunder  stands excluded. That was the view taken by this  Court. In  other cases,  that was  also followed by another learned Single Judge of the High Court. In that view of the  matter, the  learned Single  has committed  grievous error of law in not admitting the writ petition. The appeal  are accordingly  allowed.

A short question which arose before the Division Bench of the High Court was: Whether after conclusion of the court’s sale, was it open to the Company Judge to call for fresh bids? This question was not answered by the Division Bench on the ground that appeal under Section 483 of the Companies Act was not maintainable in law and that the said appeal was misconceived as there was no adjudication of rights.  However, no detailed reasons have been given in the impugned order for coming to the conclusion that appeal under Section 483 was misconceived.  We do not wish to express any opinion on the above question.  We also do not wish to express any opinion on the merits of the case. The impugned order is being set aside only on the ground that the High  Court was required to consider various legal aspects involved while answering the above question regarding non- maintainability of Section 483 of the Companies Act.  Prima facie, we may say that this is an important question because certain rights of auction purchaser flows from the conclusion of court’s sale and it is in this light that the Division Bench was required to consider the question of maintainability of appeal under Section 483 of the Companies Act. In case the Division Bench now comes to the conclusion that appeal was maintainable before it under Section 483, then, it may consider the contentions raised by respondent No.4 herein on merits. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside.   Division Bench of the High Court is requested to decided the said question within a period of eight weeks from today.

Reshma-plaintiff, her mother S. Ratna was brought on record as legal heir. 3.           A compromise application was filed before the trial court by plaintiff- S.Jayanth and S.Ratna and in lieu thereof a compromise decree was passed on 30.9.2004. During the pendency of the suit, respondent No. 1 had filed an application under Order 1  Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure  being Misc. Application No. 8 of 2002 in the Original Suit for impleading him as a party defendant to the proceedings. The said application was rejected by the trial court by its order dated 3.3.2004. Respondent No. 1, instead of filing an appeal against the order of refusal to implead him as a party, preferred a first appeal under Section 96 of C.P.C. before the High Court challenging the compromise decree passed by the trial court on 30.9.2004.  When the matter came up  before the       High Court, a memo is alleged to have been filed by the respondents in the appeal namely; S. Jayanth and S. Ratna stating that they had no objection to set aside the compromise decree dated 30.9.2004  and to implead  respondent No. 1  as defendant in Original Suit No. 350 of 1993. Acting on that memo, the High Court by impugned order dated 9.8.2006 set aside the compromise decree without going into the merits or demerits of the case and remanded the matter to the trial court to proceed with the suit on merits after impleading respondent No. 1 as party to the suit.  Aggrieved by the said order of the High Court, the present appeal has been  filed. 4.           It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the appeal filed by the stranger to the proceedings without he being impleaded as a party was not maintainable   at  all.  Apart from this, the compromise decree dated 30.9.2004 between the parties, i.e. the appellant and  respondent http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 No. 2 could not have been set aside only on the request made by one opposite party when the other opposite party had not made  such a request for setting aside  the compromise decree.  It is well settled that the compromise decree can be set aside only on the joint prayer of the parties to the compromise and not on the basis of assertion or request to that effect by one of the parties.  In pursuance of our order dated 15.1.2008, the appellant has produced before us the Memo of Consent filed before the High Court.   From that Memo also, it is clear that the Memo was filed and signed by respondent No. 2 herein S. Jayanth (respondent No. 1  in the appeal before the High Court) and not by the appellant S. Ratna (respondent No. 2 in the appeal before the High Court).   The High Court has committed an error in setting aside the compromise decree and remanding the matter  to the trial court for hearing on the suit in accordance with law on its own merits. 5.

1565," NANAVATI, J. ----------- This petition is filed under Article  32  of the  Constitution  of India challenging the order of detention passed by the Government of Tamil Nadu, on 23.11.98, under Section 3  of  the  Conservation  of Foreign   Exchange  and  Preservation  of  Smuggling Activities Act, 1974.  Pursuant  to  this  detention order, the detenu was detained on 28.1.99. It  is  not  necessary to state the facts in detail as this petition deserves to  be  allowed  on the ground that there was undue delay in passing the detention order.    The  order of detention has been passed as the detenu was found to  be  smuggling  23 gold  biscuits  weighing  2679.5 grams into India on 8.12.97  itself  and  again  on  19.12.97  when  his further statement  was  recorded.    The  contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner  is that  even  then,  the order of detention came to be passed as late as on 23.11.98,  that  is,  after  11 months and 15 days.  It was further submitted by him that  the  satisfaction  of  the detaining authority regarding the need to immediately detain him with  a view  to prevent him from continuing the prejudicial activity was therefore  not  genuine.    He  further submitted  that because of this defect, the order of detention  stands   vitiated   and   the   continued detention  of  the  detenu  should  be  declared  as illegal. In  reply  to  this  contention,  the  State Government  in  its counter has stated that the show cause notice was issued  to  the  detenu  under  the Customs   Act   on   4.5.98   and  the  adjudication proceedings were  over  on  9.1.98.      The   State Government,  therefore,  did  not  proceed  with the proposal till then and  took  up  the  proposal  for consideration only  thereafter.    The  order of the Ministry of Law  in  that  behalf  was  obtained  on 2.11.98  and the grounds of detention were framed on 18.11.98 and the order of detention  was  passed  on 23.11.98.   No  other  explanation has been given by the State Government for not passing  the  detention order earlier.      The  State  Government  has  not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 explained why it thought it necessary to  wait  till the  adjudication  proceedings  before  thee customs authorities were over since that was  not  necessary for exercising the power under the COFEPOSA Act.  In absence  of  any  satisfactory explanation as to why the State Government  did  not  exercise  the  power earlier, it has to be held that delay in passing the order of  detention  was unreasonable.  It will also have  to  be  held  that  the  explanation  of   the detaining  authority  as  regards  immediate need of detaining the detenue was not genuine. The  order  of  detention  therefore  stands vitiated and is quashed hereby. The Writ Petition is allowed  accordingly.

The  appellant  -  Khazan  Singh  was  appointed  as  a Lambardar by  the Collector  of  Jind  by  his  order  dated 17.12.90. That  order was challenged by one Tek Chand before the Commissioner,  Hissar Division. the Commissioner without setting aside the order of the Collector remanded the matter to him  for fresh  consideration of  merits and  demerits of Khazan Singh  and  Tek  Chand.  This  order  of  remand  was challenged by  Khazan Singh  by filing  an appeal before the Financial Commissioner,  Haryana. He  disposed of the appeal by declaring  that the  order passed  by the  Collector  has become final  and by  observing that  the  proceedings  have become infructuous as a result of death of Tek Chand. Aggrieved by  that order,  Shamsher Singh,  son of  Tek Chand filed  a Writ Petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. It  disposed of  the petition by remanding the case to the  Collector and  directing  the  Collector  to  permit Khazan Singh  to continue as Lambardar till a fresh decision is taken  by him  as to  who  should  be  appointed  as  the Lambardar. The  High Court  also directed  the Collector  to invite fresh  applications  from  other  interested  persons before deciding who should be appointed as the Lambardar. Aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court, Khazan Singh has filed this appeal. It was submitted by the learned counsel  for   the  appellant  that  the  Collector’s  order appointing the  appellant having  become final as it was not set aside  by any of the appellate authorities, no direction could have  been given  to the  Collector  to  invite  fresh applications and  decide who  should  be  appointed  as  the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 lambardar. In  our opinion,  this contention  deserves to be accepted.  Even  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent conceded that  so long as the appointment of Khazan Singh as Lambardar is  not cancelled, it is not permissible to invite fresh applications. As the order passed by the High Court is not sustainable,  it has  to be  set aside.  We,  therefore, allow this  appeal, set  aside the  order passed by the High Court and  remit the  matter to  the Financial Commissioner, Haryana, to decide the appeal afresh as the question whether the cause  of action  survived or  not was  required  to  be decided before  closing the  proceedings. It will be open to Shamsher Singh  to apply  to the  Commissioner to  join as a respondent in the said appeal and contend that it is open to him  to   challenge  the  appointment  of  Khazan  Singh  as Lambardar. It  will be open to Khazan Singh to raise all the contentions which are permissible in law. This appeal is allowed accordingly.

On contest, the suit was dismissed by the trial court and an appeal preferred by the respondent-  Ajit Singh Nandal- before the appellate court was allowed, inter alia, on the findings that Ajit Singh Nandal was permitted to resume his duty on 11th October 1996 by the Registrar of M.D. University without imposing any condition, namely, requirement as to taking prior sanction of the Vice Chancellor, M.D. University and as the declaration of the post held by Ajit Singh Nandal as vacant amounted to his removal from service and also that since no enquiry in compliance with Clause 2(B) of Part II of the Rules was held, the imposition of the aforesaid major penalty could not be sustained. On the aforesaid findings the regular second appeal filed by M.D. University, Rohtak before the High Court was dismissed by the impugned judgment.

1569," JUDGMENT O R D E R Delay condoned. Appeal admitted. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 28.01.2004 of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana whereby the learned Single Judge has reversed the judgment and order of acquittal recorded by the Addl. Sessions Judge, Sangrur under Section 15 of the NDPS Act, 1985.  The Trial Court acquitted the accused-appellant on the ground that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused-appellant was in possession of 90 Kgs. of poppy husk.  Aggrieved against the order of acquittal of the accused-appellant, the State of Punjab preferred an appeal before the High Court which was allowed and the accused was convicted of the offence punishable under Section 15 of the NDPS Act and sentenced to undergo RI for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine to further undergo RI for two years. This appeal has been filed through Jail and Mr. Shiv Kumar Suri, Advocate was assigned the case through Supreme Court Legal Services Committee. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that in fact the accused was never served with the notice issued by the High Court and the appeal has been decided by the High Court without hearing the accused.  Therefore, he submitted that the judgment and order of the High Court be set aside and case may be remitted back to the High Court to be decided after giving an opportunity to the accused-appellant. We summoned the original record of the High Court to satisfy ourselves whether the service of notice was effected on  the accused or not.  According to the High Court proceedings it appears that on 2.4.1991 leave to appeal was granted and notice was issued. Thereafter it does not appear from the record whether the accused was served at any point of time or was represented before the High Court. Learned counsel for the appellant has raised a specific ground in his memo of appeal that the accused was never served and represented before the High Court and that the conviction has been recorded behind the back of the accused.  Learned counsel for the State is not in a position to make any statement whether the accused-appellant was served or not before the High Court. Since this is a case where the accused-appellant has been convicted for a term of ten years and the offence charged is  of grave nature, therefore we cannot presume the service of notice on the accused.  However, in the interest of justice we think it proper that looking to the gravity of offence and the sentence imposed upon the appellant, he may be given a fair trial in the matter.  Hence, we set aside the judgment and order of conviction passed by the High Court and remit the appeal to the High Court to decide the same afresh after hearing the accused in accordance with law.  We are informed that the accused-appellant is in jail.  Since, the accused-appellant has been in jail in view of the conviction recorded by the High Court, it would be in fairness of things that we enlarge him on bail so that he gets an opportunity to present case before the High Court.  We direct that the accused-appellant shall be enlarged on bail upon his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.10,000/- with two solvent sureties in the sum of Rs.5,000/- each to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

The High Court set aside the judgment of the  Appellate  Authority  dated  20th Dec.  1989  which  affirmed  the  order of the Land tribunal dated 24th Nov.,  1980.  The  dispute  between  the  parties before  the  international  was  as to whether the appellant before us was the cultivating tenant. A limited notice was issued in these appeals  as  to whether  the  High  Court  had acted within its jurisdiction under Section 103 of the Act.  That Section reads as under: ""103, Revision by  High  Court  :-  (1)  Any person aggrieved by - (i)  any  final  order  passed  in an appeal against the order of the Land Tribunal; or this Act; or (ii) any final  order  passed  by  the  Land Board Under this Act; or (iii)  any  final  order  of  the Talok Land Board under this Act, Learned senior counsel for the  appellant  contended that  the  Taluk Land Board and the Appellant Authority have not failed to decide any question of law  nor  could  it  be said that  any  such  question was erroneously decided.  The High Court had interfered with the order of the tribunals on the  ground  that  several  material   documents   including judicial  proceedings were not adverted to by the tribunals. The High Court held that the legal effect of these documents was not considered by the tribunals.  On those  grounds,  it was  argued  the  High  Court  was not entitled to interfere under Section 103 of the Act.  Learned  senior  counsel  for the  appellant  submitted that if certain documents were not considered  or  their  legal  effect  was  not  taken   into consideration,  still  that  did  not amount to an erroneous http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 decision of a question of  law,  not  failure  to  decide  a question of  law.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the question of existence of  tenancy  was  a question  of  fact  and  if  certain  documents  which  were relevant  in   that   connection   were   not   taken   into consideration  it could not be said that the question of law was erroneously decided or was not decided. We find sufficient force in the  contention  of  the learned  senior  counsel  for the appellant in regard to the meaning of the words  ""has  either  decided  erroneously  or failed to  decide any question of law"".  On the facts of the present  case  learned  senior  counsel  is   justified   in submitting  that the lower tribunals had neither decided any question  of  law  erroneously  nor  failed  to  decide  any question of   law.      Mere  non-cnsideration  of  relevant documents  including  the  relevance  of  certain   Judicial Proceedings  would  not  strictly fall within Section 103 of the Act. But that, in our opinion, is  not  the  end  of  the matter.   The  High court had still powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to quash the orders  passed  by the tribunals if the findings of fact had been arrived at by non-consideration of the relevant and material documents the consideration  of  which  could  have  led  to  an  opposite conclusion.   This  power  of  the  High  court  under   the Constitution of India is always in addition to the powers of revision under  Section 103 of the Act.  In that view of the matter the High Court rightly set aside the  orders  of  the tribunals.   We  do  not, therefore, interfere under Article 136 of the constitution of India.  The appeals fail and  are dismissed. No costs. may  within such time as may be prescribed, prefer a petition to the High Court against the order on  the  ground that the appellate authority or the Land Board, or the Taluk Land  Board,  as  the  erroneously, or failed to decide, any question of law.""

Mulla, T.  L. Garg  and N.  D.  Garg    for  the Petitioner. The order of the Court was delivered by http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 KRISHNA IYER,  J., The  criminal scenario with a tragic crescendo which  has been  unfurled in  this  Special  Leave Petition starts with’ a bunch of ’suspects’ being brought up to the police post which was in charge of the petitioner, an Assistant Sub-Inspector.  A case  of theft  in some officers house had been reported to the police the previous night and so as  part of the investigation the suspects were picked up and suffered  as part  of  the  process  of  ’investigation’ severe flagellation.  Chhabila, one  of those  so  tortured, succumbed to his injuries. This 278 triggered off  investigation into  the murderous  conduct of the  investigator,  the  petitioner,  and  another.  Medical examination  revealed   the  cruel   cause   of   death   as asphyxiation. One  of the  injuries which,  according to the doctor, made  the deceased  unconscious was  torture on both the soles of the foot of the victim. A trial for murder fol. lowed, a  conviction under  s. 302  was enter and eventually the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment so far as the petitioner was concerned. A false explanation of  suicidal hanging  was set  up by  the police officer-accused but  this was  rejected and  eventually on a study of the circumstances and the incontrovertible facts of flagellation and asphyxiation within police premises and the testimony of  eyewitnesses about  nocturnal detention within the police  station and beating up of the victim, the courts below concurrently  found the guilt of the petitioner proved beyond reasonable  doubt. Strenuous  submissions  have  been made to  us by  Shri  Mulla  to  discredit  the  prosecution version of murder but we are not in the least convinced that there is any error in the appreciation or the conclusion. We are deeply disturbed by the diabolical recurrence of police torture  resulting in  a terrible scarce in the minds of common  citizens that their lives and liberty are under a new peril when the guardians of the law gore human rights to death.  The   vulnerability  of   human  rights   assumes  a traumatic, torture  some poignancy when violent violation is perpetrated by the police arm of the State whose function is to protect  the citizen  and not to commit gruesome offences against them as has happened in this case, Police lock-up if reports  in  newspapers  have  a  streak  of  credence,  are becoming more  and more  awesome cells.  This development is disastrous  to  our  human  rights  awareness  and  humanist constitutional order. The State,  at the highest administrative and political levels, we hope, will organise special strategies to prevent and punish  brutality by  police methodology. Otherwise, the credibility of the rule of law in our Republic vis-a-vis the people of the country will deteriorate. We conclude  with the  disconcerting  note  sounded  by Abraham Lincoln: ""If you  once forfeit  the confidence  of  your  fellow citizens you can never regain their respect and esteem. It is  true   that you  can fool all the people some of the time,  and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. 279 These observations  have become  necessary to  impress upon’ the State   police  echelons the urgency of stamping out the vice of ’third degree’ from the investigative armoury of the police.

Appeal by certificate from the judgment and order dated the 12th  Feb., 1968 of the High Court of Assam and Nagaland at Gauhati in First Appeal No. 21 of 1963. D. Mookherjee and S. K. Nandy, for the appellant. M. H. Chowdhury and S. N. Chowdhury, for the respondent The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER,  J.-The concurrent  conclusions  of  fact http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 reached by  both the  courts below  regarding the quantum of compensation payable  to the appellant on the acquisition of his land  for a  public purpose by the State are assailed by Shri D. Mukherjee before us on the ground that the amount is grossly inadequate.  Having heard  him in  the light  of the High Court’s  reasoning, we  are  persuaded  to  affirm  the finding. 100 bighas  of land  belonging to  the appellant (a Tea Planter) were  first requisitioned  by Government  to settle landless people  and the  owner ’gladly’ agreed to surrender the area which, on his own showing, was lying unused. Later, the State  proceeded to  acquire the  land under s.7 (1A) of the Assam  Land  (Requisition  and  Acquisition)  Act,  1948 (Assam Act  XXV of  1948). The sole dispute turns on whether the lesser  scale of compensation proceeded under s.7(1A) or the larger  one stipulated  under s.7(1) is attracted to the situation. The  simple statutory test that settles the issue is to  find out whether the land acquired is Lying fallow or uncultivated. If  it  is,  a  small  compensation  alone  is awardable, as laid down in s.7(1A) of the Act. On the other 69 hand. if  it is ten garden, the quantum is as under s. 23 of the Land  Acquisition Act,  1894. This decisive factor lends itself to  easy decision, because a plethora of evidence, to most of  which the  appellant is  a party,  proceeds on  the basis that  the land  in question  is fallow. The High Court has collected  and considered the prior statements and other materials leading  to the  reasonable holding  that  s.7(1A) appropriately applied  to this  case. It  follows  that  the appeal has no merit and deserves to be dismissed. We order  both parties  to bear their respective costs. Subject to this direction, the appeal is dismissed. V. M.

Swamy for the Respondents. The following Order of the Court was delivered: ORDER In  respect  of  the civil  miscellaneous  petition  for clarification  of this Court’s judgment dated 4th  November, 1988,  it  is made clear that the assessable  value  of  the processed fabric would be the value of the grey-cloth in the hands  of the processor plus the value of the job-work  done plus manufacturing profit and manufacturing expenses whatev- er these may be, which will either be included in the  price at the factory gate or deemed to be the price at the factory gate  for the processed fabric. The factory gate here  means the  ""deemed""  factory gate as if the processed  fabric  was sold  by the processor. In order to explain the position  it is made clear by the following illustration: if the value of the  grey-cloth in the hands of the processor is  Rs.20  and the value of the job-work done is Rs.5 and the manufacturing profit and expenses for the processing be Rs.5, then in such a  case  the value would be Rs.30, being the  value  of  the grey-cloth plus the value of the job-work done plus manufac- turing  profit and expenses. That would be the  correct  as- sessable-value. If the trader, who entrusts cotton or man-made fabric to the processor for processing on job-work basis, would give a declaration  to the processor as to what would be the  price at  which  he would be selling the processed  goods  in  the market, that would be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessable-value  of  the processed fabric and  excise  duty would  be  charged to the processor on that  basis  provided that  the declaration as to the price at which he  would  be selling  the  processed goods in the market,  would  include only the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric would  leave the processor’s factory plus his  profit.  Rule 174 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 346 enjoins that when goods owned by one person are manufactured by another the information is required relating to the price at which the said manufacturer is selling the said goods and the person so authorised agrees to discharge all the liabil- ities under the said Act and the rules made thereunder.  The price at which he is selling the goods must be the value  of the grey-cloth or fabric plus the value of the job work done plus the manufacturing profit and the manufacturing expenses but  not  any  other subsequent profit or  expenses.  It  is necessary  to  include the processor’s expenses,  costs  and charges plus profit, but it is not necessary to include  the trader’s  profits  who gets the fabrics  processed,  because those would be post-manufacturing profits.

These appeals  by special  leave  arise from the  judgment of  the Division  Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High  Court, dated  November 23,  1995 and  July 28, 1995 in C.W.P. Nos. 15828/95  and 1479/95 respectively. The admitted  position is  that the respondents came to be appointed  as daily  wagers on contract basis to the post of Clerk.  They filed  writ petition  in the  High Court for their regularisation.  The High  Court in the impugned order has directed  payment of wages on the principle of equal pay for equal  work and  also regularisation  of their services. Thus these appeals, by special leave. The controversy  is no  longer res judicata. This Court in State  of Haryana  v. Piara  Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118] has laid down  the guidelines for appointment by recruitment and if need  be by  regularisation of  class IV  employees. As a consequence, any appointment made to the service shall be in accordance with  the statutory rules and also the guidelines laid down  thereunder. Therefore,  the appellant is directed to  consider   their  cases   in  accordance  with  law  and guidelines  laid   down  therein   for  appointment  of  the respondents to  the service  as per  law provided  they  are otherwise eligible.  If they have become age-barred, age may be relaxed  for the period they have worked. On appointment, from that  date they  will be  entitled to  equal pay on par with the regular clerks. Shri Manoj Swarup, learned counsel for the respondents, contends  that   the  post   held  by  the  respondents  are interchangeable and  in fact  they have been interchanged to enable them  to hold  the posts.  That contention  cannot be given acceptance  for the  reason that since the respondents were appointed on contract basis on daily wages, they cannot have any  right to  a post  as  such  until  they  are  duly selected and  appointed. Merely  because they  are  able  to manage to  have the  posts interchange,  they cannot  become entitled to  the same pay-scale which the regular clerks are holding by  claiming that  they are discharging their duties as regular  employees. The  very object  of selection  is to http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 test  the   eligibility  and   then  to  make  selection  in accordance with  rules prescribed for recruitment. Obviously the respondents  recruitment was not made in accordance with the rules.  This Court  has also  pointed out  in  State  of Haryana &  Ors. v. Jasmer Singh & Ors. [JT 1996 (10) SC 876] in that  behalf. If  any illegal  actions have been taken by the officer after recruitment, it would be a grave matter of indiscipline by  the officers and the higher authorities are directed to  look into  the matter and see that such actions are rectified, but that would not be a matter for this Court to give  legitimacy to illegal acts done by the officers and to grant  relief on the basis of wrong or illegal actions of superior officers. The appropriate authority would look into and take  suitable disciplinary  action against  the  erring officers and  submit the  report of the action taken and the result thereof to the Registry of this Court. The appeals  are accordingly  allowed and the orders of the High  Court set  aside, but the directions that would be followed are as indicated in the judgment. It is needless to mention that they would take expeditious action in following the directions.

No.  14 of 1976. Frank Anthony and B. Kanta Rao for the Appellant. P. P. Rao, G. N. Rao and L. J. Vadakara for the Respondent. The Order of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA  IYER,  J.-Leave  is  granted  on  the  question  of sentence only. This  is  a case Where the accused have  been  acquitted  of counterfeiting  but  have been convicted  of  possession  of materials  for counterfeiting.  It makes  little  difference from the point of view of guilt and injury to. society.  The trial  court  awarded  a  sentence  of  10  years   rigorous imprisonment  and that has been affirmed by the High  Court. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 We  think  that  health  and  prolonged  incarceration   may sometimes  be  self-defeating.   The most  hurtful  part  of imprisonment is the initial stage when a person is  confined in  prison.   Thereafter he gets sufficiently  hardened  and callous  with  the result that by the time he  is  processed through  the  years inside the prison he  becomes  more  de- humanised.   The whole goal of punishment being curative  is thereby  defeated.   The accent must therefore be  more  and more  on rehabilitation, rather than retributive  punitivity inside  the  prison.   In this context,  it  is  helpful  to remember items 58 & 59 in the rules applicable to  prisoners under sentence framed as the Standard Minimum Rules 404 of  the Treatment. of Prisoners (U.N.  Document  A/COF/76/1, Annex.  I.A.) 58.   The  purpose  and  justification  of   a sentence of imprisonment or a similar  measure derivative of liberty is ultimately to protect society  against crime.  This end can only  be achieved if the period of imprisonment is used to  ensure, so-far as possible, that upon  his return  to  society the offender is  not  only willing  but  able to lead a  law-abiding  and self-supporting life.. 59.   To  this  end,  the  institution  should utilize all the remedial, educational,  moral, spiritual  and  other  forces  and  forms   of assistance    which   are   appropriate    and available,  and  should  seek  to  apply  them according  to the individual, treatment  needs of the prisoners., Giving anxious consideration to the need for  rehabilitation and  deterrence we consider that the prisoner in this  case, who is the appellant before us may serve a sentence of  five years  which may be long enough for correctional  treatment, at  the  same  time  not  unduly  lone  to  be  regarded  as repugnantly harsh.  We dare say that during this period  the State  jail  authorities  will  take  care  to  subject  the appellant to humanising treatment so that when he comes  out he will desist from criminality and turn a new leaf. We  reduce the sentence awarded by the courts below to  five years rigorous imprisonment on both counts which are to  run concurrently, Subject to the above, the appeal is dismissed. S.R.

1579," JUDGMENT DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. CIVIL APPEAL NO.5091 OF 2004. 1. Heard learned counsel for the parties. 2. We find the approach of the High Court, (both learned Single Judge and the Division Bench), to be erroneous. It is conceded by learned counsel for the respondent that the representation made on 05.05.2000 by Shiv Chander More was for a fresh grant of license. The Ltd. Governor found and, in our view, rightly, that a second renewal was not permissible referring to a judgment of this Court in Ratan Kaur Vs. Union of India (1997 (10) SCC 61). The order was challenged before learned Single Judge. Strangely, though learned Single Judge held that the decision was applicable but nevertheless granted relief to the respondent. The matter was carried in appeal before the Division Bench by the Lt. Governor, the Deputy Commissioner and the Tahsildar. Peculiarly, the Division Bench found that the decision in Ratan Kaur's case (supra) to be not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. Once learned Single Judge held that the decision was applicable, it was not open to the Division Bench to take a different view without even indicating any distinguishing feature. However, Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent Nos.1 to 4 submitted that the representation did not reflect the correct state of affairs, and in fact, what was being objected to was the action for eviction. That matter was never projected before the Lt. Governor and, as noted above, the prayer was for renewal. The order of the Lt. Governor, therefore, was legal and proper and the High Court should not have interfered with it. If the respondent has any remedy, as claimed, other than seeking fresh grant and/or renewal, that did not fall for consideration in the representation before the Lt. Governor and the High Court. We express no opinion in that regard. 3. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent without any order as to costs.

1580," JUDGMENT 2002 (3) SCR 620 The following Order of the Court was delivered In this writ petition, the question which arises for consideration relates to pension which is payable to a Judge who retires from this Court after having been appointed directly from the Bar. Similar question also arises with regard to Bar appointees to the High Courts. Experience has shown that the Bar appointees especially, if they are appointed at the age of 50 years and above get lesser pension than the Service Judge appointees. It is to be seen that as far as the Constitution of India is concerned, it stipulates the manner of appointment of the Judges and provides what may be termed as the qualification required for their appointment. The Constitution contemplates appointment to the High Courts from amongst members of the Bar as well as from amongst the Judicial Officers. The Constitution does not provide for any specific quota. Till a few years ago in practice 66-2/3% of vacancies were filled from amongst members of the Bar and 33-1-1/3% from the Judicial Services. It is only in the Conference of 4th December, 1993, of the Chief Ministers and the Chief Justices that it was decided that the number of vacancies from amongst the judicial Officers ""might go up to 40%."" The decision of 4th December, 1993, cannot mean that the number of Judges from the Services have to be 40%. The normal practice which has been followed was 2/3rd and 1/3rd from amongst members of the Bar and Judicial Services respectively and it is only on a rare occasion that the Chief Justice of a High Court can propose more service Judges being appointed if suitable members of the Bar are not available. But this cannot be more than 40% in any case. It may here also be noted that in the Chief Justices’ Conference held in 1999 it was unanimously resolved that the quota should normally be 66-2/3% and 33-1/3% and it is on this basis the Government should determine the likely number of Bar Judges and then consider whether the High Court Judges who are appointed from amongst the members of the Bar should not be given the same weightage as is now sought to be given to the members of the Bar who are appointed to this Court as far as pension is concerned.

1581," J U D G M E N T (Arising out of SLP ) No.13897 of 2003) S. N. VARIAVA, J. Delay condoned. Special leave granted. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not placed in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. DSB-60, Sector-Old Court, Hisar, on 30th June, 1988.  As the possession was not delivered, the Respondent filed a complaint. The District Forum directed payment of interest @ 18% from the date of deposit till the date of offer of possession.  The State Commission, in the Appeal filed by the Appellants, reduced the rate of interest from 18% to 15% and further directed that interest would be payable after two years from the date of deposit. The National Commission disposed of the revision in terms of its Judgment in HUDA vs. Darsh Kumar. For reasons set out in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) the Order of the National Commission cannot be sustained and is hereby set aside. We are told that interest @ 15% has been paid on 11th May 1999 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and possession has also been offered on 6th October 1997.  As interest @ 15% has already been paid on the principles set out by us in our Judgment in Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra), the Appellants cannot claim refund.  If the TDS has been deducted then the Appellants shall pay to the Respondent, within two weeks from today, the amount of TDS deducted with interest thereon at the rate of 12% from the date of deduction till payment.  The Appellants to inform the Respondent that he can take possession whenever he wants.   The Appellants not to claim any further or other amounts from the Respondent. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as it has been passed by taking into account special features of the case.  The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases.

Notification  under   Section  4   [1]  of   the   Land Acquisition Act,  1894 was  published on  December 26,  1985 acquiring land  admeasuring  5  acres  21  gunthas  for  the purpose of  formation of Hemavathi left bank canal. The Land Acquisition Officer  awarded compensation  on  February  23, 1988 @  Rs. 4800/-  per acre.  On reference, the civil Judge relying upon  Ex.P-3 awarded  compensation @ Rs. 20000/- per acre.  He  categorically  rejected  the  contention  of  the claimant that  he was  growing sugarcane,  hybride jowar and mulberry getting  a full  yield  of  Rs.  25000/-  acre.  On appeal, the High Court by impugned judgment dated August 18, 1994 in  FA No. 1311/94 confirmed the same. Thus this appeal by special leave. Having considered  the facts  and circumstances in this case, we  think that  reasonable compensation  would be  Rs. 10000/- per  acre. The  judgement   referring to Ex. A-3 has been placed  before us  and it  indicates that it related to land with  coconut trees.  Even the  amount awarded  by  the civil judge in that case is now subject matter in the appeal before the District Judge filed under Section 54 of the Act. Under these  circumstances, Ex. A-3 is absolutely irrelevant http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 for determination  of  the  compensation.  Accordingly,  the respondent  is  entitled  to  enhanced  compensation  @  Rs. 10000/- per  acre with solatium at 30% under Section 23 [2], interest under Section 28 9% for one year from the taking of possession and  at 15%  thereafter on  enhanced compensation till date  of deposit into court and additional amount under Section 23  [1-A] at 13% per annum from the date of issue of Section 4 [1] notification till date of the award.

1585," O R D E R Leave granted.  We have  heard learned  counsel on both sides. Nand Lal  Pant, the  first respondent  was appointed to the post  of Trained  Graduate Teacher on September 28, 1974 in the  pay scale  of Rs.250-550/-. He was confirmed in that post. The  post of  Post Graduate  Teacher  (Sanskrit)  fell vacant after  retirement of one S.N. Sastri. Since the first respondent had  the qualification  of Sanskrit, he was asked to  officiate   in  the  said  post  of  Graduation  Teacher (Sanskrit). He  made representations  from time  to time for his promotion to the said post. Since it was rejected on the ground that there was no channel of promotion from the cadre of TGT to the cadre of PGT, Sanskrit. Consequently, he filed Writ Petition  No.3794/93 in  the High Court. The Delhi High Court by  the impugned  judgment dated July 31, 1996 allowed the writ petition and directed the Government to promote him w.e f.  1986 with  all consequential  benefits.  Thus,  this appeal by special leave. It is  now for the first time that stand has been taken by the  Petitioner (respondent  in  the  writ  petition)  by letter dated  December 22, 1992 the School was informed that the Deputy  Director  (East)  was  ""pleased  to  accord  the clearance for P.G.T. (Sanskrit) reserved for Scheduled Caste candidateds"". Pursuant  to that  it would  appear  that  one Rajbir Singh  belonging to  Secheduled Castes  was appointed w.e.f. September  30, 1993  and eversince  he was working in the said  post. As  per the  recruitment Rules,  there is no direct channel  of  promotion  from  TGT  (General)  to  PGT (Sanskrit). As  a consequence,  the first  respondent as  of right is  not entitled  to the  promotion as PGT (Sanskrit), that too  in a post reserved for Scheduled Castes. But since the first  respondent has  been working  since 1986  in  PGT (Sanskrit) from  June, 1986  when the  post fell vacant, the facts and  circumstances, we  think that the appellants have to be  directed  to  create  a  supernumerary  post  of  PGT (Sanskrit) and  allow the  first respondent  to continue  in that post  till he  retires. That  post may be be created in any school  or directorate  as the  case may be. He would be entitled to the scale of pay of PGT (Sanskrit) from the date http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 of the creation of the post. This direction to adjust him by creation of  supernumerary post  and  to  permit  the  first respondent to continue in that post should not be treated as a precedent  in any  other case.  No one is entitled to jump the regular  channel merely on the basis of by qualification acquired or the basis of having officiated in a higher post. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.

Sub-s.(2)  says ""Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-s.(1), the person in possession  of the  land on which there is a homestead or hut in  the occupation of a kudikidappukaran may, if he bona fide requires  the land  for constructing a building for his own residence  require the  kudikippukaran to shift to a new site"".  Sub-s.(3)   says   that   notwithstanding   anything contained in  sub-s.(1) and  (3) where  the total  extent of land held by a person, either as owner or as tenant, is less than one acre and there is a kudikidappu on any land held by him, he  may, if  he requires  the  land  occupied  by  such kudikidappu  for   constructing  a   building  for  his  own residence apply  to the  Government for  the acquisition  of land to  which the kudikidappu may be shifted.

Thereby, under sub-s.(3) read with sub-s.(2) of s.75 of the Act,  the appellant  is entitled  the land  to construct building for  orphanage when  they intend to seek possession from Kudikidappu Karan. They required  the government  to acquire  the land  to which Kudikidappu  Karan may be shifted. It is stated across the bar  that the  appellant has  already offered attractive accommodation to  the respondents.  In  paragraph  7  it  is stated that  the Special  Tahsildar accordingly after notice to the  parties with the assistance of the Revenue Inspector http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and Village  Officer measured  out the site and fixed up the shifting expenses  at Rs.8000/-.  Thereafter, a  Draft  sale deed was  prepared and  on approval  of  the  draft  by  the Tribunal the appellant registered the sale deed in favour of the Kudikidappu  Karan in  respect of  the site measured and set out  by the  Tahsildar. Under  these circumstances,  the appellant had  clearly complied  with the  provisions of the Act and entitled to construct the building for orphanage and the  residence   of  nuns   and  sisters.

No. 267 of 1993 whereby the High Court modified the decree and judgment dated 1.05.1993 passed by the District Judge, Kangra at Dharamshala. 2)      The facts which are necessary for the disposal of this appeal are as under: The dispute between the parties is in respect of land comprising of Khasra Nos. 404, 415 and 465 measuring 1.10.73 Hectares in Mohal and Mauza Bhatehad, Tehsil Dharamshala, District Kangra.  On 19.7.1990, the original plaintiff, predecessors of respondents herein filed a suit for declaration that the entries  with regard to Khasra Nos. 404, 415 and 465 made in the revenue record are not correct as wrongly shown the defendants/appellants herein in the column of owners and prayed for possession in alternative. The defendants/appellants filed written statement and opposed the suit on the ground that civil court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate any question with regard to conferment of proprietary right in respect of the land in dispute, that the suit is barred by limitation, and that the defendants are in possession for the last 60-70 years and earlier his predecessor-in-interest were in possession of the suit land.  By judgment and decree dated 29.02.1992, the suit was dismissed being barred by limitation.   Challenging the same, the plaintiff/respondents filed C.A. No.61 of 1992 on the file of the District Judge, Kangra at Dharamshala.  The District Judge, by order dated 01.05.1993, dismissed the appeal with some modification passed by the trial Court. Aggrieved by the said order, the respondents filed R.S.A. No. 267 of 1993 before the High Court of Himachal Pradesh.  The High Court by the impugned order partly allowed the appeal holding that the plaintiffs are in possession in part of the land comprising Khasra Nos. 415 and 465 and dismissed the appeal as well as the suit so far as Khasra No. 404 is concerned.  Against the said order, the appellants have filed this appeal by way of special leave. 3)      Heard Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned counsel for the appellants and Mr. Himinder Lal, learned counsel for the respondents. 4)      The subject-matter of the dispute relates to Khasra Nos. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 404, 415 and 465.  Based on the oral and documentary evidence, more specifically revenue records produced before the trial Court, it has come to the conclusion that Khasra No. 404 has been in possession of the original defendant and Khasra Nos. 415 and 465 have been in possession of the original plaintiff.  The High Court, based on the finding of fact arrived at by the trial Court, that the original plaintiff was not in possession of Khasra No. 404 and had no knowledge about the revenue entries, dismissed his suit insofar as Khasra No. 404 is concerned.  On the other hand, the other two Khasra Nos. 415 and 465 are concerned, the High Court after noting that the original plaintiff has been in possession and cause of action accrued to him when the original defendant extended threat of dispossession, which is within the limitation, allowed the second appeal in part.  Inasmuch as the High Court arrived at such a conclusion based on the factual finding of the trial Court which, in turn, relied on the oral and documentary evidence as well as entries in the revenue records, which being the position, in the absence of any other material, we do not find any justifiable ground to interfere with the conclusion of the High Court. 5)      In the light of the above conclusion, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.

1590," O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard learned  counsel  on  both  sides.  This appeal by  special leave   arises from the order of the High Court of  Jammu &  Kashmir  dated  July  10,  1992  made  in Contempt petition no. 2879/91. The admitted position is that one Smt.  Melo Devi,  a teacher,  claims her  dues after her retirement. While  the claims  were  under  settlement,  she filed a  writ petition. pending writ petition, she died. The son of Melo Devi, by name Bal Raj Sharma, was substituted as legal representative.  When he was called upon to submit the claims, he  had also  set up the will executed be his mother in favour  of his son, viz, the grandson of Melo Devi, as to his entitlement  to future pension. We are informed that the claims due  on her  retirement and  the pension to which she was entitled  as on  the date  of her demise were calculated and  the  amount  was  deposited  in  the  court.  The  only question, therefore, is: whether her grandson is entitled to the family pension? ’Family’ has  been defined in Rule 11 of schedule 15 of the J  & k  CSR, Vol.  II and  para 240 B (II) of CSR Vol. 1 thus: ""11. For purpose of these rules the term ""Family"" shall mean- (a)  Wife, (b)  Husband,  in  case  of  female officer, (C)  (Minor) sons, (d)  unmarried     and      widowed daughters, (e)  Brothers below  the age  of 18 years and unmarried or widowed sisters, (f)  father, and (g)  Mother"". http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 ""The term  ""family"" for the purpose of Article 240B shall mean (a)  Wife,  in  the  case  of  male officer; (b)  Husband,  in  the  case  of  a female officer; (c)  Sons; (D)  Unmarried     and      widowed daughters   (including    step children      and      adopted children); (e)  Brothers below  the age  of 18 years   and    unmarried   and widowed sisters; (f)  Father; (g)  Mother; (h)  Married daughters; and (i)  Children   of  a  pre-deceased son"". It would  thus be  seen that grandson is not one of the members of  the family  for which  he is entitled to lay any claim on  the basis  of a will said to have been executed by his grandmother. It would be seen that since her son Bal Raj Sharma is  already an  employee, hi  is not  entitled to the family pension.  Under those  circumstances, the  High Court was clearly  in error  in directing  payment of  pension  to grandson and also issuing contempt for non-compliance of its order. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs. it is open the respondent  to withdraw  the  amounts  which  are  stand deposited in the court.","This appeal by  special leave   arises from the order of the High Court of  Jammu & Kashmir dated  July  10, 1992.

We have  heard Shri  Navin Malhotra, amicus curiae and the learned Attorney-General for the State of Tamil  Nadu. In  State of Andhra Pradesh v. Vallabhapuram Ravi 1058 (Criminal Appeal  No. 254  of 1984)  in which  judgment  was delivered on  September 14,  1984 this  Court has  held that adolescent offenders  kept in  a Borstal School by virtue of orders made  by the  State Government  under section 10-A of the Andhra  Borstal Schools  Act, 1925 cannot be detained in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the Borstal  School or  in any  other place  after they have attained 23  years of  age and that they should be released. The provisions  of the  Tamil Nadu Borstal Schools Act, 1925 are identical  with the  provisions of  the  Andhra  Borstal Schools Act,  1925.

Ganapati which had taken  the view  that after  section 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  1973 came  into force  a person who was convicted of  an offence  punish able  under section  302 of Indian Penal Code but sentenced to imprisonment for life and who was  by virtue  of an order passed under section 10-A of the Tamil  Nadu Borstal  Schools Act,  1925  detained  in  a Borstal School  could not be released before he completed 14 years  of   detention  has   also  been  overruled.  In  the circumstances it has to be held that the State Government of Tamil Nadu  cannot  keep  any  adolescent  offender  who  is convicted of a capital offence but sentenced to imprisonment of life  in respect  of whom  an order is made under section 10-A of  the Tamil  Nadu Borstal  Schools Act  in a  Borstal School or  in any  other kind  of  detention  after  he  has attained  23   years  of  age.  We,  therefore,  direct  the Government of  the State  of Tamil  Nadu to release all such inmates of  the Borstal  Schools  in  Tamil  Nadu  who  have attained 23 years of age forthwith.

1592," JUDGMENT 2003 Supp(2) SCR 63 The following Order of the Court was delivered : The respondents herein were allotted land under the provisions of the Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Act’). Under the provisions of law, which then existed, the Court was empowered to cancel the order of allotment within one year, if the same was found to be contrary to law. In the year 1980, by virtue to Rule 38-A (10)(bb) of the Orissa Land Reforms (General) Rules, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Rules’), the Commissioner of Division was given the power to suo motu cancel the land at any time. It appears that the Commissioner of Division in the year 1984, in exercise of his power, revoked the allotment of land made in favour of the respondents, having found that there were some procedural irregularities in the matter of allotment. In the year 1986, the respondents herein filed petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Orissa, challenging the order passed by the Divisional Commissioner, revoking the settlement of land in their favour. The High Court allowed the writ petitions and remanded the matter to the Revenue Officer and concerned Sub-Divisional Magistrate for deciding the matter afresh. In the same year, the Revenue Officer cancelled the allotment of land in favour of the respondents having found that the said allotment was illegal. In the year 1992, the respondents herein filed petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Orissa. The High Court allowed the writ petition by reason of the impugned order dated 4.2.93, inter alia, on the ground that the power of suo motu revision has been exercised after an inordinate delay. Aggrieved, the State of Orissa has filed these appeals by way of special leave petitions. Although there was a considerable delay in filing these appeals, this Court, while granting leave, condoned the delay. That is how the matters came up before us. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that as the writ petitions filed by the respondents herein were extremely belated and suffered from laches, the High Court ought not to have entertained the petitions. We find substance in the argument. What we find here is that the matters were decided in the year 1986, whereas the writ petitions were filed in the year 1992. There was an inordinate delay for which no sufficient cause was shown before the High Court and the High Court thus ought not to have entertained those writ petitions. On this short ground, the judgments under challenge deserve to be set aside. The appeals are allowed. There shall be no order as to costs. Before we part with the case, we may observe that the Revenue Officer/ Sub- Divisional Magistrate/Collector directed initiation of de-novo proceeding and allot the land in accordance with law. The authorities concerned shall give effect to the said order and if the respondent is found to be eligible for grant of lease, his case may also be considered in accordance with law http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 alongwith the other eligible persons.","In the year 1980, by virtue to Rule 38-A (10)(bb) of the Orissa Land Reforms (General) Rules, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as ’the Rules’), the Commissioner of Division was given the power to suo motu cancel the land at any time.

1594," O R D E R This appeal  by special  leave arises against the order of the  High Court of Allahabad made on February 22, 1980 in W.P. No.6667  of 1978.  The finding,  as a fact, recorded by both the  Tribunals under  the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings  Act is  that the  appellant had  cut Out  the existing trees  as on  January  24,  1971  and  planted  new tree.On that  premise, the question arose: whether the trees planted by  the appellant  would be  a grove land within the meaning of Section 23 [8] of the Act which reads as under: [8] ""grove land"" means any specific piece of  land in  a holding having trees not including [Guava, Papaya, banana  or   vine  plants]  planted thereon before January 24, 1971, in such numbers that they preclude, or when full  grown will preclude, the land or  any  considerable  portion thereof from  being used  primarily for  any  other  purpose,  and  the threes on  such land  constitute  a grove"". A  reading   thereof   clearly   indicates   that   the Legislature has  put a cut off date for existing trees as on January 24,  1971 except  the Guava,  Papaya, Banana or vine plants  planted  before  that  date.  In  other  words,  the Legislature has indicated that any grove existing as on that date with  fully grown  trees would  be the grove except the excepted trees  and for the purpose of the Act. By necessary implication any  tree planted  after that date cannot be the grove land  under the  Act. Though  the contention  of  Shri Pramod Swarup,  learned counsel  for the  appellant that  in place  of  fallen  trees  some  new  trees  were  grown,  is plausible, we cannot give acceptance to the contention since the Legislature  has specifically put a date of the existing trees, viz.,  January 24,  1971. under  these circumstances, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the view  taken by  the High  Court cannot  be  said  to  be unwarranted.

1596," J U D G M E N T KAPADIA, J. This civil appeal by grant of special leave is filed by assessee against the judgment and order dated 23.2.2000 of the Karnataka High Court in Writ Appeal No.7000 of 1999 upholding the constitutional validity of Karnataka Motor Vehicle Taxation (Amendment) Act, 8 of 1997 (hereinafter referred to as ""the said 1997 Act""). The appellant was the owner of ""Opel Astra"" which was taxed on ""value basis"" under the impugned 1997 Act.  The said 1997 Act was challenged on the ground that the levy of ""life time tax"" on the value of the car exceeding 1500 CC was arbitrary, discriminatory and hit by article 14 of the Constitution. By order dated 29.6.1999, the learned Single Judge held that the vehicle costing Rs.6 lacs and above constituted a different class by itself and, therefore, levy cannot be said to be discriminatory and violative of article 14 of the Constitution. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant herein carried the matter in appeal to the Division Bench, which, while upholding the decision of the learned Single Judge, dismissed the writ appeal.  Hence, this civil appeal. Mrs. Kiran Suri, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the impugned 1997 Act, as amended, violated article 14 inasmuch as the said Act has made an unreasonable classification between the vehicles costing more than Rs.6 lacs and vehicles costing less than Rs.6 lacs. Learned counsel further contended that the motor vehicle taxes are compensatory in nature.  Such taxes, according to the learned counsel, can only be levied on the basis of the capacity of the engine, the weight of the vehicle and the floor area, as such parameters have nexus with the user and maintenance of the road.  Learned counsel submitted that by the introduction of one more parameter, namely, the ""value"" of the vehicle, the impugned levy has ceased to be regulatory/compensatory in nature, as such a parameter has no nexus with the wear and tear of the public road.  In the circumstances, it was urged that the impugned Act was arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of article 14 of the Constitution. We do not find any merit in the above arguments.  The above classification indicates a measure or a rate of tax applied http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 differently on different vehicles depending upon various circumstances and so long as there is competence to levy and collect the tax under Entry 57 List-II of the seventh schedule to the Constitution, the levy cannot be struck down only on the ground that the incidence of the tax falls differently on different categories of the vehicles.  The burden has to be distributed on different classes of vehicles or on different persons who owned the vehicles.  How equitable such tax could fall on different persons is not for the Court to decide.  Lastly, this matter is squarely covered by our judgment delivered today in the case of The State of Tamil Nadu  v. M. Krishnappan & Another Etc. [Civil Appeal Nos.1869-1880 OF 2000]. For the aforestated reasons, we do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court.   Accordingly, the appeal fails and is dismissed, with no orders as to costs.","Karnataka Motor Vehicle Taxation (Amendment) Act, 8 of 1997 (hereinafter referred to as ""the said 1997 Act"") The appellant was the owner of ""Opel Astra"" which was taxed on ""value basis"" under the impugned 1997 Act.",civil,53.15

This appeal is filed against the order of the High Court at Delhi in Civil Revision Petition No. 25 of 2000 made on January 11, 2000. The impugned order was passed by the High Court on the application of the appellant-legal representative of deceased Defendant No.2 who is said to have died on 1st February, 1995. He sought stay of execution of the decree in proceedings under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. That application was dismissed’. He approached the High Court by filing civil revision petition. The High Court dismissed the revision on the ground that the deceased Defendant No.2 had not chosen to appear before the trial court and the matter proceeded ex-parte during his liftetime. The order of the High Court is under challenge in this appeal. It would be necessary to refer to Order XXII Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, insofar as it is relevant, which reads as under: ""4. Procedure in case of death of one of several defendants or of sole defendant.- (1) to (3)        xxx                        xxx xxx (4) The Court whenever it thinks fit, may exempt the plaintiff from the necessity of substituting the legal representatives of any such defendant who has failed to file a written statement or who, having filed it, has failed to appear and contest the suit at the hearing; and judgment may, in such case, be pronounced against the said defendant notwithstanding the death of such defendant and shall have the same force and effect as if it has been pronounced before the death took place."" A perusal of sub-rule (4), extracted above, shows that a plaintiff may be exempted from the necessity of substituting the legal representatives of a defendant who has failed to file a written statement or who, having filed it, failed to appear and contest the suit at the hearing and that, in such a case, the judgment may be pronounced against the said defendant notwithstanding the death of such defendant and it shall have the same force and effect as if the judgment has been pronounced before the death took place. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 In the instant case, it is stated by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant that no permission contemplated under sub-rule (4) was obtained from the court exempting the plaintiff from bringing on record the legal representative of deceased Defendant No.2. From the order under challenge also, it does not appear that any such permission was sought or granted by the Court. In this view of the matter, the order under challenge cannot be sustained. It is, accordingly, set aside. The appellant was, therefore, entitled to be brought on record in the suit. The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed.

1598," O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Kerala High  Court, made  on February 23, 1996 in Writ Appeal no.13 of 1995. The appellant was working as Reserved Police Constable. The Government  notified recruitment  to the  post  of  Sub- Inspector  from   in-service  candidates  who  were  holding Graduation qualification  and  were  within  30  years.  The appellant  had  applied  for  the  said  post  but  was  not considered on  the ground  that he was not working in Police Department but  was working  as Sub-Inspector in the Special Police Department.  Unfortunately,  his  writ  petition  was clubbed with  another writ petition wherein it was held that persons  having,   already  left   the  service   of  police Department and  serving elsewhere were not eligible to apply for the  post of  Sub-Inspector;  though  other  cases  were decided on  merits, appellant’s  case was  not considered on merits. Admittedly,  he is  working in the Police Department not  in   the  regular   line  but  in  the  Special  Police Department. The  Government Order  No.G.O.MS. No.55/66/Home. dated 11the February, 1966 issued by Home DE (A) Department, Government of Kerala, Trivandrum indicates thus: ""Having       considered        the recommendation  of   the  Inspector General of  Police in  consultation with  the   Kerala  Public  Service Commission,  the   Government   now direct that  all Graduates employed in the  police Department,  such as Clerks, Special  Branch Assistants, Head   Constables,    and    Police Constables    and    Officers    of Corresponding rank,  within the age of 30  years as on the first day of July   of   the   year   in   which applications are  invited, will  be eligible to  apply for  the post of Sub-Inspectors   of    Police    in http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 future."" A reading of the above paragraph would clearly indicate that Graduates  who were  employed in  the Police Department and were  within the  age limit of 30 years on the first day of July  of the  year were eligible to apply for the post of Sub-inspector of  the Police  Department. The enumeration of various posts  such as  Clerk, Special  Branch,  Assistants, Head Constables  and Police  Constables and  Officers of the corresponding  rank   would  indicate  that  they  are  only illustrative and  not exhaustive. Under these circumstances, all the  eligible graduates  within 30  years working in the Police Department  in whatever  branch, were  eligible to be considered for the post of Sub-Inspector. Now, the stand for not considering  his case taken by the Government is that he was already  promoted as  Sub-Inspector in  the Armed Police holding the  equivalent rank  of Sub-Inspector.  We find  no force in the contention. If the appellant seeks to come back to regular line of Police Department on consideration and if his found  to be  fit, he  is entitled  to be considered. It would be  open to him to get selected in accordance with the procedure. Under  these circumstances,  the disqualification now sought  to be  put is  no  impediment  to  consider  his candidature.

1599," O R D E R Leave granted. Heard both the parties. This appeal by special leave arises from the order made on November 7, 1994 in W.P. No. 4190 of 1994 by the Division Bench of  the Bombay High Court dismissing the writ petition in limine.  It related  to the challenge to the notification issued under Section 4 [1] of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [for short,  the ’Act’]  acquiring the  land in question for extension of  S.T. Bus  stand and  depot  in  Pandharpur  in Maharashtra State.  It is  no doubt  true that Pandharpur is one of  the ancient and renowned temple town of Lord Vithoba to which  all the devotees from several parts of the States, in particular  of Karnataka,  Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra congregate particularly in Ashadhamas. It is the case of the appellant that  due to  traffic congestion  it would  not be feasible to extend the existing S.T. Bus stand and the depot in the  congested area  which gets reflected from the orders passed by  the Municipality,  the recommendation made by the District Collector  and also  the resolutions  passed by the Municipality in  that behalf.  It is  also the  case of  the appellant that  under Section 54 of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Acts 1966 unless the user is changed by proper notification, the  land which  is reserved  for  residential purpose cannot  be used  for commercial  purpose. Therefore, the acquisition in question is bad in law. The only question is: whether the impugned notification is bad  in law?  Extension of  the bus  stand obviously is a public purpose  and, therefore,  it per se cannot be said to be bad  in law.  It is  true as pointed out by the Collector and the  representation dated  August 8,  1986 made  in that behalf  by   some  people   that  there  is  congestion  and acquisition is  not in  public interest.  But it  is for the Government to take a decision and it is not for the Court to decide as  to which  place is  more  convenient.  Since  the Government have taken a decision that acquiring the land for extension of  the bus  stand and  bus depot is in the public http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 interest, it  cannot be  said that the exercise of the power is arbitrary. It is  contended by  Shri U.R.  Lalit,  learned  senior counsel that when large congregation of lakhs of people come thronging the  temple  town  of  Lord  Vithoba,  instead  of relieving the  congestion by shifting the existing bus stand and bus  depot to  some place  in the  out-skirts  of  city, extension itself  will add  to the  congregation. Though the argument may  be plausible and attractive, we cannot go into that question.  It is  for the Government to take a decision and it  is not  for this  Court to  give any finding in that behalf. The  Government did  take  contra  decision.  It  is equally true  that the  area was  reserved  for  residential purpose. It  is not  the case that they are establishing the bus stand  in the  residential area  for the  first time. In fact bus  stand is already existing and acquisition was only for  extension  of  the  existing  bus  stand.  Under  these circumstances,  we   do  not   find  that   there   is   any justification warranting interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Aggrieved by the framing of charges against him under Sections 376, 511, 451 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code, the respondent-accused filed a revision petition in the High Court which was allowed vide the order impugned in this appeal by quashing the charges framed against him.  The appellant-complainant-prosecutrix has filed this appeal submitting that the impugned order is against the provisions of law as the High Court could not prevent the holding of trial by sitting in appeal against the order of framing of charge by sifting and weighing the evidence recorded during the investigation. We find substance in the submission made on behalf of the appellant.  The revision power under the Code of Criminal procedure cannot be exercised in a routine and casual manner.  While exercising such powers the High Court has no authority to appreciate the evidence in the manner as the trial and the appellate courts are required to do. Revisional powers could be exercised only when it is shown that there is a legal bar against the continuance of the criminal proceedings or the framing of charge or the facts as stated in the First Information Report even if they are taken at the face value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence for which the accused has been charged.  This Court in Kanti Bhadra Saha & Anr. v. State of West Bengal [2000 (1) SCC 722] has held that there is no legal requirement for the trial court to write a reasoned or lengthy order for framing the charges. In the instant case the learned Judge ignored the basic principles which conferred the jurisdiction upon the High Court for exercise of revisional powers.  It was premature for the High Court to say that the material placed before the trail court was insufficient for framing the charge or that the statement of the prosecutrix herself was not sufficient to proceed further against the accused-respondent. As the impugned order has been passed against the settled position of law, it is unsustainable and is accordingly set aside.  The order of framing the charge passed by the trial court against the accused is upheld with directions to it to proceed with the trial of http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the case and dispose of the same on merits in accordance with law. ...........................J.

1601," DER The  defendant-appellants,  who   are  the  subsequent purchasers,  are in appeal.  This appeal is directed against tile  judgment of Madras High Court dated 24th January, 1994 whereby the decree for specific performance of the agreement passed by the trial court was affirmed. On  26th June, 1977 respondent No.  2 entered into  an agreement  with first respondent serein, for transfer of his life  interest  in  the property in  dispute.   On  29.2.79. respondent  No.   2 transferred the rights in favour of  the defendant-appellants  who are the subsequent purchasers  for consideration of Rs.  4.40 lakhs.  Under such circumstances, plaintiff-  respondent  No.  I brought a suit  for  specific performance,  which  was decreed by the trial court and  the appeal preferred to the Hight Court was dismissed.  It is in this way the defendant-appellants are before us. Learned  Attorney General appearing for the appellants urged that, before the High Court, the hearing of the appeal was  concluded  on  22  March, 1989  but  the  judgment  was delivered  on  24th January, 1994 - nearly five years  after the  hearing was concluded, and this long delay in  delivery of  judgment  by  itself  is sufficient  to  set  aside  the judgment  under  appeal.  Learned Attorney General has  also relied  upon  decision  of the Court in the case  of  Kanwar Sinsk  and  others vs.  Sri Thakurii Mahany - 1995 Supp  (4) SCC  125.   At present, we are not deposed to go  into  this broad  question  as urged by the learned  Attorney  General. However,  it  is correct to this extent that long  delay  in delivery  of judgment gives rise to unnecessary speculations in  the mind of parties to a case.  Moreover, the appellants whose appeals have been dismissed by the High Court may have the  apprehension that the arguments raised at the bar  have not  been  reflected  or  appreciated  while  dictating  the judgment  -  nearly  after five years.  This is  fairly  not disputed  by  learned  senior counsel, Shri  K.   Parasaran, appearing  for  respondent No.  1.  We, therefore,  on  this short  question, set aside the judgment under appeal without expressing  any opinion on the merits of the case and  remit the  case to the High Court for deciding the appeal  afresh, on  merits.   In view of the fact, that the matter has  been pending  for  a considerable period of time, we request  the High  Court to decide the matter expeditiously, if possible, within six months. Before we part with the case, we would like to observe http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 that  when this appeal was filed in this Court, the  interim relief  prayed  for  by the appellants was  refused.   As  a consequence,  respondent  No.   2 executed a  sale  deed  in favour  of respondent No.  I, and respondent No.  I came  in possession  of the property and since then, he continues  to be  in possession.  Under such circumstances, respondent No. I being the lawful owner, so long the decree remains intact, is  entitled to continue in possession over the property  in dispute.   Learned  Attorney  General   urged  that,  incase respondent  No.   I  is to continue in possession  over  the property,  the  interest  of the appellants may also  to  be protected.  It is then, learned counsel for the parties made an  agreed stetement that during the pendency of the  appeal before the High Court respondent No.  I shall not create any third  party right in respect of the property in dispute and further  shall  deposit the rent/income received  from  that property  in the High Court after deducting the  maintenance charges  and  tax liabilities which shall be subject to  the decision  of  the  appeal  in  the  High  Court.

1603," O R D E R Delay condoned. Leave granted. This appeal  by special  leave arise  from the order in the contempt  proceedings dated  August 1,  1995 made by the Madhya  Pradesh   Administrative  Tribunal   at  Indore   in Miscellaneous Application No.99 of 1994. The  admitted  position  is  that  the  respondent  was appointed as  a Sub-Inspector  in the  Police Department  on January 1,  1960 and  his date  of birth  in the High School Certificate was  August  5,  1934.  In  1992,  he  filed  an application in  the Tribunal  for correction  of his date of birth contending  that his  date of birth was July 16, 1938. The Tribunal  by order  dated February  25, 1994 disposed of the  application   with  a   direction   to   consider   the representation of  the respondent.  The  representation  was considered and  rejected by  proceeding dated  May 23, 1994. Consequently, the  respondent filed  a contempt  application contending   that   the   appellants   have   wilfully   and deliberately disobeyed  the order of the Tribunal and sought for initiation  of the  proceedings against  the  appellants under Section  12 of  the Contempt  of  Court  Act.  In  the impugned order,  the Tribunal  has held  that the respondent has not  deliberately disobeyed  the orders  of the court as direction was  to consider  the case  afresh on  the finding that the Director General of Police had not applied his mind to the  issue and  therefore the  impugned order  came to be issued. The  question is : whether the Tribunal was right in its  giving  directions?  It  is  seen  that  the  Assistant Inspector  General  of  Police  who  is  the  Administrative Officer assists  the  Administrator,  namely,  the  Director General of  Police. He  had put  up the note on it and after consideration of  it the Director General of Police had made a   note   ""inform   the   respondent"".   Obviously,   after consideration of  the case he did not agree wit the claim of the respondent  and accepted  the report  submitted  by  his subordinate, viz.,  Assistant Inspector  General of  Police. Thus, it  would be  a case where due consideration was given to the  respondent’s representation  as per  the  directions given by  the Tribunal.  The Tribunal  having held  that the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 respondent has  not deliberately  disobeyed the order, there is no power to issue further directions. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  direction are set aside.

1604," KRISHNA IYER,  J. The  State of Haryana, like the other States of  India, has  on its statute book a legislation for liquor regulation  and fiscal  levy. In fact, it is the same as the  Punjab Excise  Act, 1914.  To bring  in  progressive restriction in  the sale  of alcohol, rule 37 was amended in Haryana making  the 1st and the 7th of every month a holiday for liquor  shops. This  rule and  the statutory  source  of power to  make rules,  namely, s.  59(f) (v)  of the  Punjab Excise Act,  1914, have  been  challenged  before  us  on  a variety of  grounds and we have heard counsel on both sides.

1605," The appellant has been convicted under Section 302 IPC by the Court of Sessions Judge, Nagpur, for causing death of his  wife, bypouring kerosene on her person and setting her. ablaze.   The  High  Court  of   Bombay  has  confirmed  his conviction.  Hence, this appeal by Special leave. The  conviction  of the appellant is based upon  dying declarations.   Apart from the three oral dying declarations made  before PW-l, Ambar, PW-2 Suresh and PW-5 Mandabai, the prosecution  had relied upon two written dying declarations. The  first  such  dying declaration was recorded  by  P.S.I. Mashirkar  PW-6  who  was then attached  to  Kotwali  police station.   After receiving a telephone message at the Police Station  at about 3 p.m.  that one woman had sustained  burn injuries  in Hiwarl Nagar Zopadpatti near the Power House he rushed  to that place and recorded the statement(Ex.  34) of Vandana.   He  then  went  back to the  Police  station  and registered an offence on the basis thereof. Varidana  was  then  taken  to  the  Medical   College Hospital.   Police Inspector Dhamankar who was also attached to  Kotwali  Polioe  Station  and  was  on  patrolling  duty received  a  wireless  message   regarding  Vandana   having received  burn injuries at about 4,00 p.m.  He first went to the place of the incident but on coming to know that Vandana was  taken  to the Medical College Hospital he went  to  the hospital.  As her condition was serious and as the Doctor in charge  certified  that  she  was  fit  enough’  to  make  a statement  he recorded her statement (Ex.23) in the presence of  two  panch witnesses, PW-1 Ambar and Janardan  Vithobaji Bhanarkar.   It  was  recorded  at   about  5  p.m.   Police Inspector  Dhamankar was .not then aware of the fact that an offence was already registered at the Police Station. The  evidence of Mashirkar and Dhamankar has  remained unshaken  and  it clearly establishes that Vandana was in  a fit  condition to make these statements.  There is no reason to doubt that whatever she had stated was taken down by them correctly. PW-1  Ambar  was a neighbour of the accused.   He  has deposed that on the date of the incident about 2.00 p.m.  he heard  shouts coming from the hut of the accused, tie rushed to  that  place  and saw Vandana lying near their hut  in  a burnt  condition.  She had told him that it was the accused. who had set her ablaze.  He has also deposed about his going http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 with  Vandana to the Hospital.  There in his presence Police Inspector Dhamankar had recorded her statement  and he had also put his signature  thereon. He categorically stated that.  Vandana was conscious and was in  a  position  to make the  statement.   Dr.   Deshpande’s evidence  supports him on this point.  Only suggestion  made to  this  witnesswas  that  he nad not really  gone  to  the hospital  and his signature was obtained on a blank piece of paper  at the Police Station.  This suggestion was denied by the  witness.   We  do not find any material  on  record  to create  any doubt regarding reliability of this witness, tie being  a  neighbour,  haa no reason to falsely  involve  the accused  or be a party to a wrong statement made by Vandana. The  trial  Court and the High Court after appreciating  his evidence  and that of the other two witnesses have found  it trustworthy.   We see no reason to differ from this  finding recorded  by  the Courts below.  In view of the evidence  of three  witnesses and the two dying declarations, it  clearly stands  established  that the appellant had poured  kerosene over  the body of Vandana and had set her ablaze because she had  protested when the appellant started beating their son. We  find  no substance in this appeal and it 1s  accordingly dismissed.","The appellant has been convicted under Section 302 IPC by the Court of Sessions Judge, Nagpur, for causing death of his wife, bypouring kerosene on her person and setting her. ablaze.

Goel,  who was  working as  an assistant in he Alembic medical  Store, situated  near sirhand  Club, Ambala cantt. The  evidence of  P.C.

The evidence  of the  two  eye- witnesses clearly  establishes that  on seeing  PW 3 - Karam Singh approaching towards them the accused started their car and tried  to knocked  down PW  3 -  karam  Singh,  who  was approaching them  on scooter.  The evidence also establishes that the  person sitting  in the  car started firing at them and therefore  ASI -  Karam Singh was required to fire three shots from his revolver.

1607," JUDGMENT 2002 (1) SCR 1080 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. In the instant case, dispute was referred to the Labour Court that the respondent and worked for 240 days and his service had been terminated without paying him any retrenchment compensation. The appellant herein did not accept this and contended that the respondent had not worked for 240 days. The Tribunal vide its award dated 10th August, 1998, came to the conclusion that the service had been terminated without giving retrenchment compensation. In arriving at the conclusion that the respondent had worked for 240 days, the Tribunal stated that the burden was on the Management to show that there was justification in termination of the service and that the affidavit of the workman was sufficient to prove that he had worked for 240 days in a year. For the view we are taking, it is not necessary to go into the question as to whether the appellant is an ""industry"" or not, though reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in State of Gujarat v. Pratam Singh Narsinh Parmar, JT (2001) 3 SC 326. In our opinion the Tribunal was not right in placing the onus on the Management without first determining on the basis of cogent evidence that the respondent had worked for more than 240 days in the year preceding his termination. It was the case of the claimant that he had so worked but this claim was denied by the appellant. It was then for the claimant to lead evidence to show that he had in fact worked for 240 days in the year preceding his termination. Filing of an affidavit is only his own statement in his favour and that cannot be regarded as sufficient evidence for any Court or Tribunal to come to the conclusion that a workman had, in fact, worked for 240 days in a year. No proof of receipt of salary or wages for 240 days or order or record of appointment or engagement for this period was produced by the workman. On this ground alone, the award is liable to be set aside. However, Mr. Hegde appearing for the Department states that the State is really interested in getting the law settled and the respondent will be given an employment on compassionate grounds on the same terms as he was allegedly engaged prior to his termination, within two months from today. The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.","The Tribunal vide its award dated 10th August, 1998, came to the conclusion that the service had been terminated without giving retrenchment compensation.

1609," The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K.   JAYACHANDRA  REDDY,  J.- This matter arises  under  the Prevention  of Food Adulteration Act.  The appellant  was  a milk-vendor.  The Food Inspector purchased a sample of  milk and  sent  the same for analysis.  The  Analyst  found  some deficiency  in  solids  non-fats  and  opined  that  it  was adulterated.   The main point urged before the courts  below was  that Rule 9(j) was not complied with.  The trial  court held that it was only directory and convicted the appellant. The  appeal filed by him was allowed by the Sessions  Judge. The State carried the matter by way of an appeal to the High Court.  A batch of appeals were heard and disposed of by the High Court holding that the rule was directory. 2.   In this appeal again the same point is urged and it  is further contended that tile accused was prejudiced  inasmuch as  there is nothing to show that the report of the  Analyst was sent by registered post to the accused as required under Rule 9(j).  We need not go into the question of law in  this case.   When the Food Inspector was examined, he deposed  in his  chief-examination  that the report of the  Analyst  was sent  to the accused by registered post.  He was not  cross- examined.  The only inference that can be drawn is that  the accused  received the report.  In such a case  the  question whether  it was sent by registered post or  otherwise,  does not assume importance. 3.   The appellant was only a milk-vendor and the occurrence is said to have taken place in the year 1974.  The sample of milk was declared to be adulterated on the sole ground  that there  was  some deficiency in milk  solids  non-fats.   The adulteration  is  of  a minor  nature.   For  these  special reasons while confirming the conviction of the appellant, we reduce  the sentence to three months’ RI.  The  sentence  of fine  with  default clause is confirmed.

This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment of the  Division Bench  of the  Kerala High  Court, made  on March 17, 1995 in Second Appeal No. 358/94. The appellant  is admittedly  the owner of the property bearing  Survey   No.1960/6  in   Chettivilakam  Village  of Trivandrum District.  The appellant  had filed  a  suit  for possession  and   declaration  that   the  respondent  is  a licensee. The  trial Court  decreed the  suit on November 3, 1981 and  the appeal  was dismissed on July 22, 1993. In the second appeal,  the High  Court  has  reversed  the  finding holding that  the appellant  had executed  the gift  deed on October 11, 1966 under Ex.A-1 and, therefore, the respondent had become  the donee and remained in possession as owner of the property. Accordingly, the suit cannot be decreed. Thus, this appeal by special leave. The  recitals   in  the   deed   do indicate thus: ""All  the   right  to   enjoy   the property and the right to reside in the building  will remain  with  me during my life time and Rajan Asari will derive  the said  rights  with full freedom after my life time."" A  reading   of  the  above  would  indicate  that  the appellant had  retained the  title to  the enjoyment  of the property during her life time as full owner with all rights. Section 122  of the  Transfer of  Property Act  defines gift executive in  the manner  indicated thereunder divesting the title to  and possession  of the  donor in  the property and vesting the  same in the donee under Section 123. These must be proof  of delivery  and acception  of possession  of  the gifted property. In this case, both the title and possession is respect  of the  property remained  with  the  plaintiff. There is  no acceptance  of possession  by the respondent in the light  of above recital. As a consequence, the appellant remained to  be the  owner during her life time. Under these circumstances, It  cannot be  construed to be a gift deed in favor of  the respondents.  At best,  it  would  be  only  a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 licence in  favour of the respondent to remain in possession jointly with  the appellant.  Therefore, the  High Court was not right  in concluding that Ex.A-1 is a gift deed and that the appellant  has no  title to the property for declaration as he had parted with possession. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  judgment  and order of  the High  Court stand  set aside  and that  of the trial Court  and the  appellate Court  stand confirmed.  The decree of  manse profits  granted by  the High Court to that extent stands  confirmed. Six  months’ time  from  today  is granted to the respondent to vacate the premises.

1613," O R D E R These appeals  by special leave arise from the judgment dated 19.2.1979  of the  Division Bench  of the  Punjab  and Haryana High  Court holding  that the delegation of power to levy property  tax in  favour of  the Chief Administrator of Union Territory  of Chandigarh  Administration was in excess of legislative  power. The  operation of  Schedule II of the Capital of  Punjab (Development  and Regulation)  Act, 1952, (27 of  1952), as  amended by Punjab Act 37 of 1957, offenda the provisions  of the  Constitution. On  the facts  of this case, we  think that  it is  not  necessary  to  decide  the question on  account of diverse reasons. There is some force in the  contention of  Shri Madhava  Reddy,  learned  senior counsel for  the appellant,  that the view taken by the High Court is  not correct  in law.  But, prior to 1994 Amendment under Section  62 read  with Section 61 and 68 of the Punjab Municipal Act 1911, the assessment of the property tax shall be annual  basis and  revisable every year. Now, it is valid for five  years and  amount for  quinquinial. In  this case, since it was struck down revision was not effected. Moreover even tile  limitation for recovery of the amount due also is now barred  by limitation except for six months. That apart, the  Punjab   Municipal  Corporation   Law   (Extension   to Chandigarh) Act, 1994 (45 of 1994) which has come into force with effect  from hay  24, 1994, displaces the effect of Act 27 of  1952 as  amended by  Act 37  of 1957.  The  Municipal Corporation, as enjoined under Section 4 of 1994 Act has yet to be  constituted. After coming into force of the 1994 Act, the Chief  Administrator has  been denuded  of the  power to levy property  tax. In  view of these subsequent changes, it is unnecessary,  rather academic,  to  decide  the  question decided by  the High  Court in the impugned order. Moreover, the connected  appeals C.A.  Nos.3536, 3539,3541-43/79 filed against the  main judgment  were dismissed by this Court for non-prosecution on  May 10,  1995 and  became  final.  Under these circumstances,  we think  that these  are  not  proper cases to go into the question. The appeals are accordingly dismissed.

1617," WITH CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.248 OF 1983 Dilbagh Singh Dilbagh Singh V. State of Punjab J U D G M E N T M.K. MUKHERJEE J. These two  appeals have  been heard  together  as  they arise out  of a  common judgment  delivered by  the Punjab & Haryana High  Court affirming  the convictions and sentences recorded against  the five  appellants  under  Section  302, 302/149, 324,  324/149 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  by  the Additional Sessions  Judge, Amritsar.  While  one  of  these appeals (Crl.  Appeal No.  248/83) is at the instance of one of the  five convicts,  the other (Crl. A. No. 67-67A/83) is by the  remaining four. During the pendency of these appeals in this  Court one  of the  appellants, namely, Pargat Singh died and consequently his appeal abates. Having gone through the judgments of the learned Courts below we  find ourselves  in  complete  agreement  with  the concurrent findings  recorded by them - as they are based on a careful  consideration  and  discussion  of  the  evidence adduced during trial - except that it cannot be said to have been conclusively  proved, in  view of  the evidence  of Dr. Rajinder Singh  (PW 1) who held post-mortem examination upon deceased Mota  Singh, that  the appellants shared the common object of  causing his  murder. Except  one  incised  injury found by him on the skull of the deceased all other injuries were  lacerated   injuries  on  the  legs.  Those  lacerated injuries, according to PW 1 could be caused by fire-arm, and the incised injury by a sharp edged weapon. According to the prosecution case as detailed by the eye witnesses two of the appellants shot  at the deceased with their respective fire- arms and,  therefore, if  the common  object of the unlawful assembly of  which they were members was to kill him, it was http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 expected, in  the fitness of things, that they would shot at vital parts  of his  body, more  so when the deceased was at close quarters. The evidence of the doctor further discloses that there  was no  corresponding  internal  injury  of  the incised wound  which necessarily  means that that injury was also not  intended to  cause the death of the deceased. Such being the  state of  evidence on  record it can only be said that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to cause grievous hurt to the deceased with dangerous weapons. For the  foregoing reasons  we allow this appeal to the extent  that  the  convictions  and  sentences  of  the  two appellants (Kartar  Singh and  Dilbagh Singh)  under Section 302 and  of the  others under  Sections 302/149  IPC are set aside; and instead thereof they are convicted under Sections 326 and  326/149 IPC respectively. For the above convictions each of them will suffer a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for seven years. The other convictions and sentences imposed therefor will,  however, stand.  The  substantive  sentences will run concurrently. The appellants, who are on bail, will now surrender to their bail bonds to serve out the sentences imposed upon them.","Two appeals arise out of a common judgment delivered by the Punjab & Haryana High Court.

1618," J U D G M E N T B.P.Singh,J. We have heard counsel for the parties. The facts not in dispute are that lands belonging to the appellant were acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.   The collector made his Award again st which the appellant preferred a reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act and t he same was pending when the Land Acquisition Amendment Bill was introduced in the Parliament on 30th April, 1982 and the Amendment Act  came into force from 24th September, 1984.   In between these two dates Reference Court made its Award on February 10, 1983.   After the Award the appellant received the amount awarded to him and did not prefer a further appeal therefrom. In the year 1995 the appellant filed an application under Section 152 C.P.C. before the Spec ial Sub-Judge, Ranchi claiming that he was entitled to the benefit conferred by Sections 23(2) a nd 28 of the Land Acquisition Act as amended by the Amendment Act.   The learned Sub-Judge held that the said application was not maintainable and the said finding has been affirmed b y the High Court. We find no reason to interfere with the order of the High Court because a mere perusal of Section 152 makes it clear that Section 152 C.P.C. can be invoked for the limited purpose of correcting clerical errors or arithmetical mistakes in the judgment.   The Sectio n cannot  be invoked for claiming a substantive relief which was not granted under the decree, or as a pretext to get the order which has attained finality reviewed.

1621," O R D E R The appeal  lie in  a short compass. The appellants are the legal  representatives of  defendent  Nos.7  to  9.  The respondents plaintiff  Nos.1 and  2, filed  T.S. No.66/58 on October 7,  1958 to  declare that the compromise decree made in T.S.  No.72/26 is  null and  void and does not bind them. The trial court dismissed the suit. On appeal, while holding the allegations  that the compromise was obtained by playing fraud on the plaintiff was not proved, it was allowed on the ground that  it does  not  bind  the  plaintiff.  As  stated earlier, the  trial court  after  going  into  the  evidence dismissed the  suit holding that the decree was not obtained by fraud  and that,  therefore, the  decree was valid and is binding on  them. In  T.S. No.1962/62,  the appellate  court also recorded  the  finding  that  the  compromise  was  not vitiated by  fraud, but  since defendants Nos.7 to 9 have no right  in  the  property,  the  family  arrangement  in  the compromise was  not valid  and that,  therefore, it does not bind the  plaintiffs. Accordingly  it reversed the decree of the trial  court and decreed the suit by Judgment and decree dated September 15, 1971. The appellants  carried the  matter  in  Second  Appeal No.63/72. The single Judge of the High Court by Judgment and decree dated June 28, 1978 dismissed the appeal holding that since the  11th defendant  died on  July  9,  1973  and  the application  for  substitution  was  not  filed  within  the limitation, the  entire appeal stands abated and accordingly the appeal was dismissed. Thus this appeal by Special Leave. Admittedly, the  property belongs  to one  Ganga Bishan who had  1/6th share in the joint family property and on his demise his  widow, Daulat  Kaur, came  into possession  as a limited owner  in respect  of the  lands in  dispute bearing plot Nos.132, 133 and 138. Daulat Kaur gifted the properties to the  defendants Nos.1  and 2 on April 4, 1926, which gave rise to  the tile  Suit No.72/26  challenging the  aforesaid http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 gift. Therein,  the  compromise  was  affected  between  the parties and  each one  of the  four branches  were  given  3 bighas 3  katas each  out of a total extent of 14 bighas, 12 katas. Daulat Kaur died on June 27, 1956. These  facts   clearly  establish   that  there   as  a compromise recorded  in the  judicial  proceedings  in  T.S. No.72/26 in  which each  of the  branch was  proportionately given @ 3 bighas, 3 katas each. The question then is whether the compromise was vitiated by fraud. Unless this finding is established, decree  binds the  parties as  it  was  validly recorded in  a judicial adjudication and it cannot be set at naught. In  view of  the findings of both the trial court as well as  the appellate  court that  no fraud was played, the compromise decree  does not  get vitiated. The question then is whether  the second appeal stands abated. It is seen that the defendent  No.11 in  the trial  court is only one of the persons representing  the branch of the defendants No.9. The other defendants  are already representing the estate of the 11th defendant.  The death  occured on  July 9, 1973 and the application for  substitution was filed on October 17, 1973, practically after the expiry of the nine days of limitation. The application  for substitution  was filed  two days after the Puja  Vacation. It  would have been in time, if filed on the day the Court re-opened after Puja vacation. Under these  circumstances the  High Court  was  wholly illegal in  finding that  the appeal abated, and in refusing to condone  the delay  of nine  days in  bringing the  legal representatives on  record. The  explanation of delay is not as rigorous  as one  to condone  delay in filing the appeal. The appeal  is, therefore,  allowed with the result that the decree in T.S. No.72/26 stand unaffected.","The appeal  lie in  a short compass. The appellants are the legal  representatives of  defendent  Nos.7  to  9. The respondents plaintiff, Nos.1 and 2, filed  T.S.

Three years prior to  retirement, he was called upon to prove that he is scheduled caste  and departmental  enquiry was  held. He was given opportunity and it was found, relying upon the entries in service  book, S.S.L.C.  Register and  other  documentary evidence, that he is not a member of the scheduled caste and as such  he is  not  eligible  to  enjoy  the  status  as  a scheduled caste  in the Government service. On that premise, they imposed,  under Rule  14 of CCS (CCA Rules), punishment of forfeiting  his pension. Calling  in question  that order dated December  9,1987, the   petitioner  filed  an O.A.  in the     Tribunal.     The  Tribunal,   after     elaborately considering   the   evidence   on  record,  confirmed    the finding of the disciplinary authority that  the   petitioner had   wrongfully   gained   appointment against   the   post reserved    for   Scheduled   Castes,    and  imposition  of penalty of forfeiture of pension was legal. We have  gone through the reasoning of the Tribunal. We find that the same are perfectly justified. It is vehemently contended by  the learned  counsel for  the petitioner,  Sri Srinivasan, that  a certificate  was issued  in 1956  by the competent authority  stating that the petitioner belonged to the  community   recognised  as   a  scheduled   castes  and petitioner’s  grandfather   belonged   to   Thotti   Naicken community and  he continued  in office  for the period of 30 years. At  this belated stage, it cannot held that he is not a scheduled caste and cannot be called upon to prove it once over. We  cannot   appreciate  this   stand  taken   by   the petitioner. It  is for  the  petitioner  to  prove  that  he belongs to the scheduled caste specified in the Presidential Notification in  relation to  the State to which he  belongs http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 and   was born.   In  S.S.L.C.  register, the petitioner did not claim  his status  as a  scheduled caste.  On the  other hand, his   father’s name  was mentioned  as Ganga Naidu and he  claimed   to  be   Hindu.  In  those  circumstances  the Certificate obtained  from the  Revenue Authorities  in  the year 1956 is obviously a false certificate. Under these  circumstances the penalty of forfeiture of pension cannot  be said  to be  unwarranted.

The appellants question correctness of the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court who dismissed the appeal filed by the appellants simply observing that the Criminal Revision Petition No.117 of 2001 filed by the informant has been dismissed and the said revision and appeal related to the same judgment.  It is to be noted that the appellants as accused nos. 2 and 3 faced trial for alleged commission of offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ’IPC’), along with accused no.1 i.e. Tej Ram who has expired in the meantime, while several others some of whom have died in the meantime, the allegations were under Sections 147,148, 149 and 307 IPC for which the accused Nos.1, 2 and 3 were also similarly charged. The trial court by its judgment dated 13.11.2000 held that the appellants Kalu Ram and Roop Chand were guilty of offence punishable under Section 304 Part I read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years with a fine of Rs.1000/- with default stipulation.  All the other accused persons were acquitted. The informant Ranjit Singh filed a revision application questioning the conviction of the appellants under Section 304 Part I IPC.  According to him they should have been convicted under Section 302 IPC and the other accused persons should not have been acquitted. Appellants filed an appeal questioning their conviction and sentence imposed. Learned Single Judge took up the criminal revision first and held the same to be without merit.  But without considering the merits of appeal filed by the present appellants dismissed the same holding that in view of the decision in the Criminal Revision Petition No.117 of 2001, the appeal also was without merit. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. It did not hear the learned counsel for the appellants. On the contrary in the judgment it has been indicated as if the appellants were http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 represented by Mr. Rajesh Aggarwal and Ms. Mridul Aggarwal who in fact were the learned counsel for the informant Ranjit Singh in the connected Criminal Revision. The summary disposal of the appeal is also not proper as no opportunity was granted to the appellants to substantiate their challenge to the legality of the judgment of the trial court. We find that the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant to be correct. The case of the appellants was not independently examined.  Merely because the Revision Petition filed by the informant was dismissed that could not have been a ground for not discussing the merits of the appeal filed by the appellants.  A Criminal Revision Petition may have been without merit; but that did not make the appeal filed by the appellants meritless. On the above grounds alone we set aside the order of the High Court and sent it to the High Court for a fresh consideration on merits.

1626," ORDER 1.   This  appeal  by  special  leave  arises  against   the judgment and decree of the Delhi High Court in R.F.A. No. 59 of  1978 dated February 26, 1979.  The  plaintiff  appellant filed  the  suit for declaration that she  is  the  absolute owner  and  is  in  possession  of  the  house  bearing  old Municipal No. 5925 and new Municipal No. 4477, Ward No.  XI, situated at Plot No. 7/1 8, Darya Ganj, Delhi.  She  claimed to have purchased the property from one Kaushalya Devi under a  sale deed dated May 11, 1946 registered on May  29,  1946 and thereby she is said to be the owner.  Shri Ratti Ram had no right, title or interest to alienate the property by  the sale deed dated January 29, 1947 which was said to have been executed  to stiffle the prosecution in tended to be  lodged against  him.   The  trial court  dismissed  the  suit.   On appeal, the High Court confirmed it. 2.   The question is whether the suit is within  limitation. In  the evidence, it was admitted that she had knowledge  of the  execution and registration of the sale-deed on  January 29,  1947.   Initially  a suit was filed  in  1959  but  was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file fresh suit.  Ad- mittedly, the present suit was filed on July 30, 1966.   The question,   therefore,  is  whether  the  suit   is   within limitation.   Article 59 of the Schedule to  the  Limitation Act,  1963, relied on by the appellant  herself,  postulates that  to cancel or set aside an instrument or decree or  for the rescission of a contract, the limitation is three  years and it begins to run when the plaintiff entitles to have the instrument or the decree cancelled or set aside or the  con- tract  rescinded first become known to him.  As  seen,  when the appellant had knowledge of it on January 29, 1949 itself the  limitation  began to run from that date and  the  three years limitation has hopelessly been barred on the date when the suit was filed.  It is contended by Shri V.M.  Tarkunde, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 learned  senior counsel for the appellant, that the  counsel in the trial court was not right in relying upon Article 59. Article  113 is the relevant Article.  The  limitation  does not begin to run as the sale deed document is void as it was executed  to  stifle the prosecution.  Since  the  appellant having  been  remained in possession, the  only  declaration that  could be sought and obtained is that she is the  owner and  that the document does not bind the appellant.  We  are afraid  that we cannot agree with the learned  counsel.   As seen, the recitals of the documents would show that the sale deed  was executed for valuable consideration  to  discharge pre-existing  debts and it is a registered document.   Apart from  the  prohibition under s. 92 of the  Evidence  Act  to adduce oral evidence to contradict the terms of the  recital therein, 225 no  issue in this behalf on the voidity of the sale-deed  or its  binding nature was raised nor a finding  recorded  that the  sale-deed  is  void under s.23  of  the  Contract  Act. Pleading  itself is not sufficient.  Since the appellant  is seeking   to  have  the  document  avoided   or   cancelled, necessarily,  a declaration has to be given by the court  in that behalf.  Until the document is avoided or cancelled  by proper  declaration,  the duly registered  document  remains valid and binds the parties.  So the suit necessarily has to be  laid within three years from the date when the cause  of action  had occurred.  Since the cause of action has  arisen on  January  29, 1947, the date on which the  sale-deed  was executed  and registered and the suit was filed on July  30, 1966,  the  suit is hopelessly barred  by  limitation.   The courts below, therefore, were right in dismissing the  suit. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.","Delhi High Court has dismissed the appeal by Shri Ratti Ram.

1627," Present : Hon’ble Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.B. Pattanaik Ranbir  Yadav,   Adv.  for  R.S.  Suri,  Adv.  for  the appellant B.B. Vashisht,  P.   Narasimhan and R.S. Suri, Adv. for the Respondent O R D E R The following order of the Court was delivered. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave relates to nature of the offence committed by him. The admitted  position is  that on  October 25, 1985 at about 6  a.m. in  village Kahlon  within the jurisdiction of the Police  Station Nawahshahr,  one Santokh  Singh and  his party and  the respondents  ad their  party had a dispute on land. They  indulged in quarrel as a result of which Santokh Singh died.  The courts  below recorded  a finding  that the occurrence had  taken place  at 6.00  p.m. in which both the parties   sustained injuries.  The  deceased  Santokh  Singh received as  many as  8 injuries  five of  which were on the head. As  per the  evidence of  PW-2 the  autopsy doctor, he died of the multiple injuries on the head. The injuries were inflicted with  a gandasa.  According to the ordinary course of nature.  Therefore, it  is clearly  a case  under  Clause thirdly of  Section 300,  IPC and of murder punishable under Section 302,  IPC unless  the case  is brought in any one of the exceptions engrafted is Section 300 IPC. The trial Court and the  appellate Courts  have  applied  Exception  (4)  to Section 300 which reads as under : Culpable homicide  is not murder if it     is     committed     without premeditation in  sudden  fight  in the heat  of passion  upon a sudden quarrel and  without the offender’s having  taken  undue  advantage  or acted  in   a  cruel   or   unusual manner."" In this  case, the  courts below  found that  the  four http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 injuries  inflicted  by  the  respondent-Sarwan  Singh  were responsible for  the death of the  deceased. It is seen that when Sarwan  Singh had  inflicted four  injuries on the head with gandasa  which is  a heavy weapon, it is obviously that he had the knowledge that the injuries would result in death of the  deceased. It is true that  there was a free fight in which both  the  parties  including  the  accused  sustained injuries. Obviously,  therefore, Section  149  IPC  was  not rightly applied and  this Court refused leave as against the acquittal of  others. However,  the respondent cannot escape the offence.  The parties had to fight over dispute of land. It is not the case of the accused that he had acted in self- defence of  him  or  others  and  in  exercise  thereof,  he inflicted the  injuries. Therefore,  the  right  of  private defence has not been rightly applied and was not extended to the accused.  Under these  circumstances, the  only question that arises  is :  whether   the  respondent  had  inflicted injuries without  undue advantage  and acted  in a  cruel or injuries with  a gandasa on the head, it is implicit that he had taken  undue advantage  and acted  in a cruel or unusual manner in  inflicting four heavy blows on the head resulting in death  of Santokh  Singh. Under  these circumstances, the learned Sessions  Judge as  well  as  the  High  Court  have committed grave  error of  law in  applying Exception  4  to Section 300  IPC  and  giving  the  respondent  the  benefit holding it   to  be an  offence of  culpable  homicide.  The conviction by  the courts below under Sections 304 IPC, Part I, therefore,  is set  aside. The  offence is  one of murder punishable  under  Section  302  IPC  and  accordingly,  the respondent is  convicted of  the offence and is sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life under Section 302 IPC. The appeal  is accordingly allowed.",The parties had to fight over dispute of land. The injuries were inflicted with a gandasa. It is not the case of the accused that he had acted in self- defence of him or others.,special leave petitions,33.26
1628," JUDGMENT ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. The only question raised for consideration in this appeal is whether purchase tax can be charged on the element of market fee on the basis that the same does not form part of the turnover. Writ Petition filed by the respondent was allowed by the High Court and this appeal has been filed by special leave. Under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948 (in short the ""Act"") ""turnover"" is defined in Section 2(i) to include: ""the aggregate of the amounts of sales and purchases and parts of sales and purchases actually made by any dealer during the given period, less any sum allowed as cash discount and trade discount according to ordinary trade practice, but including any sum charged for anything don by the dealer in respect of the goods at the time of, or before, delivery thereof’. Interpreting this provision with reference to the Marketing Regulations, under Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961 (in short ""Markets Act"") the High Court noticed that the incidence of tax in the present cases is when the turnover exceeds the taxable quantum, the buyer has to pay market fee as the writ petitioner are licensees within the market area; that such market fee is not paid by them to the sellers; that, therefore, such amount of the market fee cannot be part of the sale consideration; that the writ petitioners were not required to show in their turnover the amount of the market fee as part of the purchase price of such of the agricultural produce purchased by them locally; that such market fee is not to form part of the turnover for assessment or payment of purchase tax. This Court in Anand Swarup Mahesh Kumar v. CST, [1980] 4 SCC 451 had occasion to consider whether additional tax on certain dealers levied on turnover of purchases mentioned in Section 3-D(1) of the U.P. Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam, 1964 (in short ""U.P. Act"") collected from purchases by commission agent can be included in the turnover of purchases. This Court explained that there are four circumstances in which turnover could be include and they are :(i) if the produce is sold through a commission agent, the commission agent may realise the market fee from the purchaser and shall be liable to pay the same to the Committee; (ii) if the produce is purchased directly by a trader from a producer the trader shall be liable to pay the market fee to the Committee; (iii) if the produce is purchased by a trader from another trader, the trader selling the produce may realise it from the purchaser and shall be liable to pay the market fee to the Committee, and (iv) in any other case of sale of such produce, the purchaser shall be liable to pay the market fee to the Committee. Under what circumstances, the market fee is to be paid needs to be considered and once it is held that the buyer has an obligation to pay the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 market fee and it is the duty of the seller to deposit the market fee on behalf of the buyer and, therefore, to realise it from the buyer, it is not the legal obligation of the seller to pay market fee on such a transaction and thus the amount of market fee cannot be treated as part of the sale consideration. Similar is the position in the present case as per law prevailing. The above position was examined by this Court in State of Pubjab and Ors. v. Guranditta Mal Shauti Prakash and Ors., [2004] 5 SCC 791 and relying on the decision in Anand Swarup’s case (supra), it was held that there was no obligation on the part of the seller to pay market fee since it is the duty of the buyer to pay the same and the seller can realise it from the buyer. The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that there was no liability to pay sales tax on the element of market fee. Above being the position, the appeal fails and is dismissed but without any order as to costs.",The High Court ruled that the writ petitioners were not required to show in their turnover the amount of the market fee.

1629," JUDGMENT 1994 SUPPL. (2) SCR 419 The following Order of the Court was delivered : Leave granted. The controversy in this appeal lies in a very narrow compass. The appellant who had joined the Railways as a Trains Clerk w.e.f. 18.12.1955 was promoted as Guard, Grade-C w.e.f. 1812-70 by an order dated 27.10.1970. The basic pay of the appellant was fixed at Rs. 190 p.m. w.e.f. 18.12.1955 in a running pay scale. By an order dated 25th July, 1991, the pay scale of the appellant, was sought to be refixed and during the refixation his basic pay was reduced to Rs. 181 p.m. from Rs. 190 p.m. w.e.f. 18.12.1970. The appellant questioned the order reducing his basic pay with retrospective effect from 18.12.1970 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench. The justification furnished by the respondents for reducing the basic pay was that the same had been wrongly’ fixed initially and that the position had continued due to ""administrative lapses"" for about twenty years, when it was decided to rectify the mistake. The petition filed by the appellant was dismissed by the Tribunal on 17.9.1993. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. That the petitioner’s basic pay had been fixed since 1970 at Rs, 190 p.m. is not disputed. There is also no dispute that the basic pay of the appellant was reduced to Rs. 181 p.m. from Rs. 190 pan. in 1991 retrospectively w.e.f. 1812.1970. The appellant has obviously been visited with civil consequences but he had been granted no opportunity to show cause against the reduction of his basic pay. He was not, even put on notice before his pay was reduced by the department and the order came to be made behind his back without following any procedure known to law. There, has, thus, been a flagrant violation of the principles of natural justice and the appellant has been made to suffer huge financial loss without being heard. Fair play in action warrants that no such order which has the effect of an employee suffering civil consequences should be passed without putting the concerned to notice and giving him a hearing in the matter. Since, that was not done, the order (memorandum) dated 25.7.1991. which was impugned before the Tribunal could not certainly be sustained and the Central Administrative Tribunal fell in error in dismissing the petition of the appellant. The order of the Tribunal deserves to be set aside. We, accordingly, accept this appeal and set aside the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal dated 17.9,1993 as well as the order (memorandum) impugned before the Tribunal dated 25.7.1991 reducing the basic pay of the appellant From Rs. 190 to Rs. 181 w.e.f. 18.12,1970.","The appellant who had joined the Railways. as a Trains Clerk w.e.f. 18.12.1955 was promoted as Guard, Grade-C w.E.F. 1812-70 by an order dated 27.10.1970.

1633," J U D G M E N T Nanavati, J. The appellant has been convicted by  the  Designated Court, Sangrur, under Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 5  of  of  the TADA Act as he was found in possession of one .22 bore pistol with 25  live  cartidges.    The  Designated Court  relying upon the evidence of Inspector Sant Kumar and ASI -  Darshan  Singh  held  that  when  the  appellant  was apprehended  he  was  found in possession of the said pistol and the cartidges.  As 10 cartidges were found loaded in the pistol, the Designated Court relying upon the decision dated 3.2.98 of this court in Kashmira Singh vs.  State of  Punjab in Criminal  Appeal No.  228/97 and also the evidence of the said two witnesses held  that  the  pistol  was  in  working order.  Therefore, even through the pistol and the cartidges were   not  sent  to  the  armourer  for  test  firing,  the Designated Court thought it fit to convict the appellant for the said offences. We  have  gone  through  the  evidence of both these witness.  Nothing was brought out in  the  cross-examination to  create  any  doubt regarding the identity of the weapon. There was no cross-examination regarding  working  condition of the  pistol.    Considering  the fact that the two Police Officers were competent enough to depose about the condition of the weapon and  the  circumstance  that  the  pistol  was loaded  with  cartidges,  it  can  be  said  with reasonable certainity that it was in working condition. We  are therefore of the opinion that he was rightly convicted for possessing the said arm without  a  permit  of licence.   As  he was found in a possession of a fire arm in the notified area, he was rightly convicted under  the  TADA ACT also. For these reasons, appeal is dismissed.","The appellant has been convicted by  the  Designated Court, Sangrur, under Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 5 of the TADA Act.

BALAKRISHNAN The  petitioners claimed that they had been working in the  first  respondent-company since last several  years  as ’Budli’   workers  and  that  they   were  entitled  to   be regularised.   This dispute between the petitioners and  the management  of the first respondent-company was referred  to the  Industrial  Tribunal by the appropriate Government  for adjudication.   The  dispute  referred   to  the  Industrial Tribunal read thus: ""Whether  the demand of the Badli workmen as shown  in the  annexure  for regularisation of their services  in  the permanent  roll of the company is justified?  What  reliefs, if any, are they entitled?"" The Industrial Tribunal, by its award dated 29.1.1999, held  that out of the 100 workmen, 92 workmen were  entitled to  be regularised and to have all benefits and status  like regular employees.  They were further held to be entitled to have  other  statutory benefits also from the date of  their respective initial engagement. The  award  of the Tribunal was challenged before  the High  Court  on the ground that the Industrial Tribunal  had committed  an error of jurisdiction as it allowed the  scope of  the  Reference to be enlarged.  But, this plea  was  not http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 accepted  by the learned Single Judge and the writ  petition was  dismissed.   An  application filed by  the  petitioners herein  under  Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes  Act, 1947  was  allowed and it was directed that the  92  workmen should  be paid every month an amount of Rs.3, 919.46  until conclusion  of  the  proceedings  or  grant  of   ’permanent workman’  status,  whichever  was earlier.  The  arrears  of wages  were also directed to be cleared within a  stipulated period.   The  decision  of  the learned  Single  Judge  was challenged before the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division Bench held that the Tribunal had enlarged the scope of the Reference and thereby committed an error of jurisdiction.   It was held that the main issue was  whether ’Budli’ workmen should be regularised, and for arriving at a just  conclusion,  it  was permissible for the  Tribunal  to consider  as  to how the workmen had been treated and as  to whether they had been subjected to unfair labour practice or not.   However, while doing so, the Tribunal, evidently, did not  put  the management of the first respondent-company  on notice.   The  Division Bench of the High Court was  of  the opinion   that   had   the     management   of   the   first respondent-company been put on notice, it could have brought on  record the relevant material therefor.  In that context, reliance  was  placed  by  the High Court  on  the  decision reported in Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co.  of India Pvt.  Ltd. vs.   Workmen 1981 (II) LLJ 218 and ultimately the  Division Bench  held that the Industrial Tribunal should consider the matter  afresh in accordance with law and for that  purpose, the  award passed by the Industrial Tribunal was set  aside. It  was  also  directed that the decision  should  be  taken within   a  period  of  three   months  from  the  date   of communication  of  the order.  The direction of the  learned Single  Judge  to extend the benefits under Section 17-B  of the  Industrial  Disputes  Act to the petitioners  was  also vacated. We  heard  the learned counsel on either side at  some length.

After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that no relief can be granted to the appellant. It is quite evident that as per the guidelines the petitioner was allowed to proceed for employment abroad. The guidelines required an undertaking to be furnished to the effect that he will resume duty within a period of two years. It is stated by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that no such undertaking was furnished. Be that as it may, there is an order dated 13th January, 1995, on the record, which grants sanction to the appellant to take up the assignment in Oman. This appears to be an ex-post facto sanction as the appellant had proceeded for a period of two years with effect from 27th September, 1994. Para 2 of this office order according sanction states that in case the appellant fails to resume duty at Chandigarh his lien will automatically expire and he shall be deemed to have permanently left the institute from the original date. It is an admitted fact that the appellant did not come back till after 1998. It is also an admitted fact that his request for extension was rejected specifically in 1997. This being the position the principle of estoppel, apart from anything else, would clearly be applicable in a case like this. A person who gets an advantage, namely, of a sanction to go abroad on service on the condition that he will come back within two years and if he does not come back, his lien will automatically be regarded as being terminated he then cannot turn around and challenge the said condition on the basis of which sanction to go abroad was granted. Of course, if there is a dispute with regard to the question whether he had in fact come back within the stipulated period or an extension had been specifically granted an inquiry may be necessary but where the facts are not in dispute the inquiry would be an empty formality. In any case principle of estoppel would clearly apply and the High Court was right in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant wherein he had challenged his termination.

The sole contention in this appeal is that the High Court in Second Appeal interfered with the finding of fact recorded by the First Appellate Court without framing a proper substantial question of law. In paragraph 6 of the High Court order although it purported to have referred to some substantial questions of law, what are those substantial questions of law which have been framed are not disclosed. Instead, the High Court proceeded with the disposal of the appeal without any framing substantial question of law. Only for this reason the order of the High Court is set aside. The matter is remitted to the High Court to hear the Second Appeal afresh after framing substantial question of law as contemplated under Section  100 C.P.C.

1640," O R D E R Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides. This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment and decree of the Kerala High Court dated May 24, 1993, made in SA  No. 368  of 1989.  The respondents  had purchased the Plaint Schedule  property in  execution of the decrees in OS No. 262/1955  on the  file of  the  Court  of  the  District Munsiff, Parappanangadi.  The  sale  certificate,  Exh.  A-2 dated January  28, 1958  was given  to the respondents. They had also filed and application for delivery of possession of the property  which had  come to  be delivered under Ex. A-3 dated 21.7.1963.  After taking delivery of the possession on October 20, 1961, they assigned the Plaint Schedule property to the  plaintiff. Under  those circumstances,  the question arises; whether  they are  entitled to a decree of perpetual injunction restraining  the appellant  from interfering with his possession?  Though the  trial Court  and the  appellate Court had accepted the case of the appellant, the High Court has pointed  out that  aforesaid documents  are material for deciding the  controversy  and  the  courts  below  had  not considered   those    documents   in   proper   perspective. Accordingly, in  second appeal, the High Court has gone into that question.  It  is  settled  law  that  the  person  who purchases the  property in  a court auction sale, gets title to the  property by  sale certificate issued by the court as true owner  and after  confirmation of  the  sale,  he  gets possession thereof. In view of the fact that Plaint Schedule property was delivered to Sankaran under Ex. A-3 on July 21, 1961, he  lawfully came  into possession  and the  same  was delivered in  turn to  the plaintiffs.  Non-consideration of the material evidence is a substantial question of law. Under these  circumstances,  the  perpetual  injunction granted by  the High  Court in  the  second  appeal  is  not vitiated by  any error of law much less substantial question of law  warranting interference.  The appeal  is accordingly dismissed. If the appellant has got any title independent of this, it  is open  to him  to have  the right established in accordance with law. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2","This appeal  by special leave arises from the judgment and decree of the Kerala High Court dated May 24, 1993, made in SA  No. 368  of 1989.

From the response filed by the said officers, it is seen that the order made by this Court on 25th of April, 2003 was received in Central Jail of Tihar No. II only on 1.5.2003 and immediately on receipt of the same, the appellant was informed to furnish the required bond with a surety.

1646," 1.  The petitioner is a manufacturer of 60 cement  at  Chittorgarh in Rajasthan.   It  had  transported cement  to various destinations through  railway  carriages. Prior to 3.5.1989, the petitioner got the cement transported through  meter gauge from the railway siding  at  Chanderia. After conversion into broad gauge the railway siding was  at Difthkola Chittor Broad Gauge Rail Link.  In consequence  34 kilometers’  distance  was added to  levy  freight  charges. Thereafter,  between  May-June,  1989 and  March,  1990  the petitioner had, various consignments, booked and transported the  cement  to diverse destinations and  paid  the  freight charges.   Later,  on January 21, 1991, the  petitioner  has sent  a notice to the Western Railway under Section 78-B  of the  Indian  Railway  Act, 1890,  (for  short,  ’the  Act’), claiming   refund  of  different  amounts.   Since  it   was rejected, on 23.12.1991 the petitioner laid the claim  under s.  16  of  the Act before the Railway  Claims  Tribunal  at Jaipur,  which by its Order dated 25.11.1992, dismissed  the petition  holding  as being barred under s.78B of  the  Act. When  it was challenged in Civil Appeal No.84/93  and  batch the  Single  Judge  of the High Court  by  his  order  dated 25.1.1994  dismissed the same.  On further appeal  No.76/94, the  Division  Bench by order dated  3.10.94  confirmed  the same.  Thus, these Special Leave Petitions. 2.   The  principal contention raised by the  petitioner  is that  it  had  discovered  the  mistake  when  the   railway authorities have confirmed by their letter dated  12.10.1990 that they have committed mistake in charging excess  freight on  wrong  calculation of distance.  The  limitation  starts running from the date of discovery of mistake and, therefore stands excluded by operation of s.17(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, 1963 Act 21 of 1963 and that s.78-B has no  application to  the facts in this case. In consequence, the  High  Court and  the Tribunal have committed error of law  in  rejecting http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 the claim for refund.  We find no force in the contention. 3.   Section  17(1)(c)  of the Limitation Act,  1963,  would apply  only to a suit instituted or an application  made  in that behalf in the civil suit.  The Tribunal is the creature of the statute.  Therefore, it is not a civil court nor  the Limitation  Act has application, even though it may be  held that  the  petitioner discovered the  mistake  committed  in paying  ’over  charges’ and the limitation is not  saved  by operation of s.     17(1)(c) of the Limitation Act. 4.   Section  78-B of the Act provides that a  person  shall not  be entitled to refund of over-charge or excess  payment in respect of animals or goods carried by railway unless his claim to the refund has been preferred in writing by him  or on  his  behalf to the railway administration to  which  the animals  or  goods were delivered to be carried  by  railway etc. within six months from the date of the delivery of  the animals  or goods for carriage by railway.  The proviso  has no application to the facts of this case.  An over charge is also a charge which would fall within the meaning of  s.78-B of  the  Act.  Since the claims were admittedly  made  under s.78-B  itself but beyond six months, by operation  of  that provision in the section itself, the claim becomes barred by limitation.  Therefore, the Tribunal and the High Court have rightly concluded that the petitioner is not entitled to the refund of the amount claimed. 5.   We  do not find any ground for our   interference  with the orders challenged in S.L.Ps. The Special Leave Petitions are accordingly dismissed. 62","The petitioner is a manufacturer of 60 cement at Chittorgarh in Rajasthan.

Consequently, authorities had taken action  on September 23, 1980 to terminate her service in terms  of  letter  of  appointment.  The  respondent  had approached the  Tribunal for  reinstatement with back wages. The Tribunal  has set aside the order of termination holding that the  termination is violative of Article 311 (2) of the Constitution since  no enquiry  was  conducted  against  the respondent. The  same came to be upheld by the High Court in the impugned order in Writ Petition No.1589(SS)/94 passed on April 5, 1994. The question,  therefore, is:  whether it  is necessary for the  Government to  conduct an  enquiry as  contemplated under Article  311(2) read  with the statutory rules? In the State  of  U.P.,  there  are  statutory  rules,  viz.,  U.P. Temporary Government Services Rules, 1975. Rule 14(a) of the said Rules  provides  for  termination  of  the  service  of temporary Government  servant either with one month’s notice or pay in lieu thereof. Under  these   circumstances,   when   the   Government exercised the  statutory power,  the need to conduct enquiry as  contemplated   under   Article   311(2)   by   necessary implication got  obviated. The  High Court,  therefore,  was wrong in holding that the enquiry under Article 311(2) needs to be  conducted to  terminate  the  services  of  even  the temporary Government servant. The appeal  is accordingly allowed.

No. 2402 of 1979. 71 http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Appellant in person. A Girish Chandra and R.N. Poddar for the respondents. The order of the Court was delivered by The appellant  had filed  a writ  petition in  the High Court of  Allahabad challenging the continuance in office of Shri Charan  Singh ’  as the  Prime Minister  and Shri  S.N. Kacker as  Minister of  Law, Justice  and  Company  Affairs. Stated briefly, the contention of the appellant is that Shri Charan Singh  failed to  seek the  mandate of  the Lok Sabha within three  weeks after  assuming the  office of the Prime Minister as directed by the President of India, that  instead of  ""facing the House"" he submitted the resignation of  his Government  on August  20, 1979 and that his continuation  in office  therefore as  a caretaker Prime Minister  without   taking  a   fresh  oath  of  office  was unconstitutional. The  writ petition  was dismissed  by  the High Court  by a judgment dated December 10, 1979 but it has granted a  Certificate of  fitness to  the appellant to file this appeal.  It is  a well-known  fact of  history that the Government of  Shri Charan  Singh was  in office  for a very brief spell.  It fell  soon after it assumed office, indeed, too soon  the issues  raised by  the appellant are no longer live and  it is  not the  practice of  this Court  to decide questions of  more academic  importance. We  must,  however, hasten to  add that the High Court is right in its view that Shri Charan  Singh’s appointment as the Prime Minister could not be  said to be conditional upon his seeking a mandate of the Lok  Sabha. Our  Constitution knows no such hybrid thing as  a   ""Prime  Minister   subjected  to   a  condition   of defeasance"". Conditions  imposed by the President may create considerations  of   political  morality   or   conventional propriety but not of constitutional validity. The High Court is also  right that  it was  not necessary  for Shri  Charan Singh and  his ministers  to take  a fresh  oath after being called upon  by the  President to  continue in  office as  a caretaker Government.  Thus, the  continuation in  office of Shri   Charan    Singh   and    his   ministers    was   not unconstitutional. For these reasons, the appsal is dismissed.

He filed the writ  petition  after  attaining  majority  in  1994  for  a direction to  appoint him on compassionate grounds which was negatived. It is  contended for the appellant that when his father died in  harness, the appellant was minor; the compassionate circumstances continue  to subsist  even till date and that, therefore, the  court is  required to  examine  whether  the appointment should  be made on compassionate grounds. We are afraid, we  cannot accede to the contention. The very object of appointment  of a dependent of the deceased employees who die in  harness is  to relieve unexpected immediate hardship and distress  caused to  the family  by sudden demise of the earning member  of the  family. Since the death occurred way back in  1971, in  which year  the appellant  was four years old, it  cannot be  said that he is entitled to be appointed after he  attained majority long thereafter.

Respondent No.1, Shri Karan Singh Saini, was appointed as Junior Engineer (Civil) on adhoc basis for a period of three months.  It appears that respondent No.3, transposed as appellant No.2, was thereafter appointed on regular basis to the same post.  Aggrieved thereby, respondent No.1 filed a writ petition which has been allowed by the impugned order of the High Court.

On this ground, the appointment of appellant No.2 was set aside. We are unable to agree with the reasoning of the High Court.  It appears that the appointment of appellant No.2 on regular basis has been made by following the procedure contained in  Rule 11(1) of Non-Teaching Staff Service Rules, 1984.

1651," J U D G M E N T Dr.AR.LAKSHMANAN, J. Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of both sides. The counsel for the appellant argued only one contention before the High Court that the land in question does not come within the provisions of Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 (for short ‘the Act’) inasmuch as the appellant had purchased the land in question through registered sale deed dt.12.01.1983 and by Notification dt.09.01.1978, the village where the land is located has come within the jurisdiction of the Patna Regional Development Authority and, therefore, Bihar Consolidation of Holdings  and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 has no application.  The said contention was reiterated by the learned counsel for the appellant before us.  The said contention, in our view, has no force.  Section 2(9) of  Bihar Consolidation of Holdings  and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 defines the ""land"" which means agricultural lands and includes horticultural land, kharaur land, land with bamboo clumps, pasture land, cultivable waste land, home steads, tanks, wells and water-channels.  The definition of ""land"" in Section 2(9) of the Act was considered by the High Court of Patna in Mirza Sulaiman Beg & Ors vs.Harihar Mahto & Ors. reported in 1985 (33) Bihar Law Journal Reports 585.  The Bench was also of the view that confining the land to being strictly agricultural land in nature, in fact, extends it to matters and things, which cannot strictly be labelled as  ’agricultural land’ - for instance, includes ’homestead’, and, by itself, a homestead was not an agricultural land stricto sensu.  In our opinion, Section 2(9) of the Act has emphatic and also couched in very wide language.  That being so, we are of the opinion that there is no legal infirmity in the order passed by the Division Bench affirming the order passed by the learned Single Judge. In the instant case, Notification was issued on 26.11.1970.  Section 5 of the Act deals with land not be transferred without sanction.  This Section reads as under :- ""5.  Land not to be transferred without sanction.- During the period commencing from the date of the publication of the notification under Section 3 to the date when the scheme if consolidation comes into operation in any notified area, in person shall transfer or partition any land in such area except with the previous sanction of the consolidation officer and if the sanction is granted, the transfer of partition, as the case may be, shall be subject to the rights and liabilities attached to the term under the scheme of consolidation in respect of such area."" The Section is very clear. The transfer or partition, as the case may be, shall be subject to the rights and liabilities attached to the term under the scheme of consolidation in respect of such area.  In the instant case, the sale was made in favour of the appellant on 12.01.1983 which is after the Notification.  It is also pertinent to notice that the consolidation proceedings were over on 10.1.1975 and 20.2.1975.  The learned Single Judge also has elaborately considered the entire matter placed before him and came to the right conclusion which was rightly affirmed by the Division Bench.  We, http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 therefore, see no reason to interfere with the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Since they were  not been  considered, he filed the civil suit for an injunction for restraining them from interfering with his possession.  The   District  Judge   vacated   the   interim injunction granted  by the  trial court  and in the revision the High  Court has  dismissed it.  Thus, this special leave petition. In  view   of  the  settled  legal  position  that  the notification  had  become  final  and  the  proceedings  had attained finality, the civil suit was not maintainable. This Court has  repeatedly held  that a  civil suit  relating  to acquisition  proceedings   is  not   maintainable   and   by implication, cognizance under section 9, CPC, is barred. The Court cannot issue mandatory injunction against the state to denotify the  acquisition under  section 48.  Therefore, the question of  granting an  injunction against  the authority; from proceedings  in accordance with the law does not arise. The High  Court, therefore,  was right  in refusing to grant injunction.  The  Court  cannot  compel  the  Government  to withdraw the  notification under section 4(1) of the Act. It is for  the Government to consider the same on merits and it keeping in  mind subservience of public interest. In view of the fact  that notification was upheld by this Court and has become final,  the Government  cannot retract from the steps taken. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.","The acquisition of the petitioners’ land has become final.

1653," O R D E R Leave granted. We have  heard  learned  counsel  on  both  sides.  The impugned order  of the  Tribunal made  in OA  No.5675/89  on March 23,  1992 is founded upon the disciplinary proceedings taken by  the appellant  for the  alleged misconduct  of the respondent by  producing a  certificates at  the time of his recruitment to  the effect that the income of his father was more than  Rs.1,000/-  per  annum.  On  that  premise,  they conducted an  enquiry under  the conduct  rules;  found  him guilty  under  Rule  6(1)  of  the  Karnataka  State  Police Disciplinary Proceedings  Rules, 1965  and imposed a penalty of stoppage  of one increment without cumulative effect. The respondent challenged  the same.  The Tribunal found that he was selected  in his  own merit  as a general candidate and, therefore, the  income has no reference. It was also found - that the  income of his grandfather from the land properties cannot  be  clubbed  as  the  concept  of  joint  family  is inapplicable to  the respondent who is a member hailing from the  majority   community  (muslim).   The  father   of  the respondent was  a petty trader. The Sales Tax Officer who is only  an   assessing  authority,   cannot  add  10%  of  his assessable income  to show  that his income is more than Rs. 750/- p.a.  On either  of these  grounds, the order imposing penalty of stoppage of one increment was held illegal. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Shri Veerappa, learned counsel for the State, contended that the view of the Tribunal is not correct in law. We find no force  in the  contention. As  seen, the vary preamble of the order  of the Tribunal does indicate that the respondent had in  fact contended  that he  was selected  as a  general candidate on  his own  merit and not as a backward class. If that be  the position,  obviously  the  income  criteria  is clearly inapplicable. Since the respondent does not have any record in  that behalf,  it is  the duty  of  the  State  to produce the  selection list  prepared by  the Public Service http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 Commission to  show whether he was selected and appointed as general candidate.  That  record  has  not  been  placed  on record. Even  otherwise also,  we are  in agreement with the Tribunal in  its findings  on  merits.  The  income  of  his grandfather from  land and  properties cannot be included in his income  since the  concept of  the joint  family is  not applicable to  the presents professing Islam. The respondent being  a  Muslim  is  governed  by  his  own  personal  law. Accordingly,   the  income  of  the  grandfather  cannot  be included to  be the income of the respondent. As regards the income of  his father,  he is a petty trader. Therefore, the Sales Tax  Officer is  competent only  to assess  the annual turnover of  the income  and assessable  income  has  to  be assessed. But  his certificate  of income including 10% more on the  assessable income  cannot, therefore, be conclusive. In  either  case,  we  do  not  find  any  merit  warranting interference to produce.

1655," WITH SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO. 23650 OF 1996 [ CC  -  5886/96 ] O R D E R SLP (C) NO.21792/96: The grievance  in this  special leave  petition,  filed against the  order of  the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court, made  on July  2,  1996  in  CMP  No.31034/95  in  OP No.10608/93, is two-fold, namely the direction to sanction a sum  of   Rs.7,10,212/-  incurred   by  one  Shri  Raghavan, Administrator and  the direction to pay a sum of Rs.35,000/- being monetary  consideration for  the work done by Raghavan as Administrator in conducting the examinations. Shri Y.R.  Reddy, learned Additional Solicitor General. contended that  the amount  of Rs.7,10,212/-  spent by  Shri Raghavan in  connection  with  conducting  the  examinations would be  dealt with  in accordance  with the administrative procedure prescribed  by  the  Dewaswom  Committee  in  that behalf and  the direction  for sanction would run counter to the administrative  procedure prescribed  in that behalf and it will create unnecessary complications in scrutinising the accounts and  passing the  bills towards the amount spent by Shri Raghavan. It is also assured by Shri V.R. Reddy that if the expenditure  has  been  spent  in  accordance  with  the requirements and  principles, the same will be sanctioned by the competent  authority in that behalf. We need not deal in that  behalf  at  length.  Suffice  it  to  state  that  the authority competent  to scrutinise the amount spent would go into the  matter and pass appropriate orders sanctioning the amount  spent   by  the   Administrator  in  conducting  the examinations. With regard to the second aspect, namely, the direction to pay  monetary  consideration  in  a  sum  of  Rs.35,000/- towards the exemplary work done by Raghvan, we feel that the High Court,  Perhaps found it necessary to direct payment of the said amount in addition to commendation of the work done by  Raghavan.   It  being   a  discretion  exercised  in  an extraordinary situation  perhaps,  we  may  not  incline  to interfere with  the direction.  But we make it clear that it would not  be treated  as a precedent in every case wherever http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 an officer  on deputation does the work at the directions of the  Court;   he  would   also  be   entitled  to   monetary considerations in  addition to  the normal  service and  the salary  received  for  doing  that  service.  We  take  this decision for  the reason  that perhaps  the officer  did not bargain for  such direction  for payment  in  rendering  the service and  any notice to him would put him in embarrassing situation and  the Court  also will  not be in a position to say anything  when  the  matter  goes  on  notice.  In  this situation  we   are  not  inclined  to  interfere  with  the direction issued  by the Division Bench of the High Court in this behalf. The petition  is accordingly  ordered  with  the  above observations. IN SLP (C) NO. /93 (CC-5886/96 ): Permission to file special leave petition is granted.

1657," J U D G M E N T MAJMUDAR. J. I have  had the benefit of reading the judgment that my brother, Majmudar,  J., is  about to  deliver and  I  am  in respectful agreement  therewith. These few lines may be read as an addendum thereto. Let me  assume for the moment that the assessee was not making   clearances on  the basis  of ""the later the better"" principal. It  would have  paid excise  duty on the pig iron input and  claimed, under the notification dated 27th March, 1971, set  off of the amount thereof when clearing the steel ingots produced therefrom. To illustrate, it would have paid Rs.‘X’ against  the excise  duty of  Rs.‘Y’ payable  on  the steel ingots produced therefrom. The assessee  has, with  the permission  of the  excise authorities, followed  over a  large number  of  years  ""the later the  better"" principal.  It does so to save itself and the excise authorities the hassle of making the book entries required by  the   said notification  of taking  and  giving credit for  the excise  duty on  pig iron when paying excise duty on  the steel  ingots produced  therefrom. Instead, the assessee pays  excise duty  on  the  steel  ingots  that  it manufactures and  does pay  excise duty on the pig iron that it  uses   in  such   manufacture.  To   use   the   example aforementioned, it  pays excise duty of Rs. ‘Y’ on the steel ingots. By  reason  of  the  use  of  ""the  later  the  better"" principle, with  the concurrence  of the Excise authorities, the  assessee   cannot  be   placed  in   a  position   more disadvantageous than  it would have had it not followed that principle It  cannot be  asked to  pay excise  duty on  some theoretical proportion of pig iron that has not been used in the  manufacture   of  steel   ingots  but   has  come  out, incidentally, as  steel scrap.

The said Municipality is a ’local authority’ constituted in terms of the provisions of the Bihar and Orissa Municipalities Act, 1922. The State of Bihar framed rules for the Municipal employees, known as Bihar Municipal officers and Servants Pension Rules, 1987. Clause 1 if Rule 4 of the said rules reads as follow: ""Municipal employees on roll on the date of confirmation of this rule and who had subscribed to the contributory provident fund under provident fund rules and want to be governed by these rules shall have the option to do so and such option shall be exercised in writing in the prescribed Form (Annexure-I) and submitted to their head office within 90 days from the date of framing of this rule by the State Government. If such option in writing prescribed form is not received within the period so fixed it will be deemed that they would retain the existing contributory provident fund."" Appellant retired from his service on 31.1.1992. The aforesaid rules were adopted by the respondent-Municipality in August, 2001. As Appellant did not give any option for switching over to the pension scheme under the aforesaid rules from the contributory provident fund scheme of which he was a member, the High Court dismissed his writ application. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the question of giving any option in terms of the Rule 4 of the Pension Rules did not arise as the same had been adopted by respondent NO. 4 - Municipality only in August, 2001. Although the learned counsel may be correct in his submission but fact remains that he had already retired in 1992 and as such, at this juncture, the respondent No. 4 - Municipality’s giving him opportunity to opt for the said scheme does not and cannot arise. We, therefore, albeit for different reasons, uphold the judgment and order passed by the High Court. However, it is stated at the Bar that the entire retirement dues of the appellant has not been paid. If that be so, we are sure that the respondent No. 4 being a ’State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, shall pay all lawful dues of the appellant at an early date. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 The appeal is dismissed with the aforesaid observations.",This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 16.10.2003 passed by a Division  Bench of the Patna High Court in LPA No. 972/2003.

State   Sugar Corpopration’s residence, which is the subject matter of the acquisition, was  yet to  be developed.

It  was decided in the said meeting that in exchange of the  acquired land,  2.18 acres  of land,  the  appellant would give an extent of 2.74 acres of land in plot No. 41/4. The Parishad  was directed to send a proposal to acquire the land of  plot No. 41/4 and also exemption of the land to the extent of 2.18 acres of land adjoining the General Manager’s residence.

This would clearly indicate that ground survey was  conducted in  consultation with  the  respective officers and  found that  deletion of  2.18 acres of land in survey Nos.  41/1 and  41/2 was necessary for convenient and comfortable enjoyment  of the  property  by  the  appellant- Ccorporation.

The  fact   are  that  pursuant  to  the  policy  dated September 12, 1983, industrial units based on various forest produce i.e.  Khair Wood  were allowed  to be  set up in the State. an association of the industries. The Government gave relaxation on  February  25,  1984  giving  liberty  to  the Director of  Industries to  encourage small scale industries on the  ground  that  those  who  would  not  operate  their industries from  the forest  wood may  be considered for the licence and  that  they  would  purchase  ‘khair  wood  from outside the State. The respondent No.4 had given provisional registration of  his proposed S.I. units for a period of one year on February 11, 1986.

The   appellant Association had  applied for  cancellation or  relaxation of the  ban  imposed  including  the  4th  respondent  but  the Director refused  to the  same. Consequently,  the appellant filed a  writ petition in the high Court.

Accordingly  it declined  to pass  any direction  as sought for. It is  contended rot  the appellant that the Government having allowed  other units  to obtain  Khair wood  from the Government  quota,  denial  of  the  same  to  S.S.I.  units registered   under   provisional   registration   would   be discriminatory violative  of Art  14  of  the  Constitution. Having given  our anxious  consideration to the conventional of the  counsel and  the  argument  of  Shri  Mehta  learned counsel for  the 4th  respondent, we are of the view that it http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 is not  a fit  case for  our interference.  If is  seen,  as stated  in  the  counter  filed  in  this  Court,  that  the Government  had   constituted  a   committee  to  which  the Secretary  Forest  was  the  Chair-person.  It  had  met  on December 13,  1990 and  had decided  that small  scale units registered prior  to December  11, 1986  were entitled to be considered for  allotment and any unit registered thereafter would be  allowed to operate only subject to their obtaining required wood  from outside  the State.  It is  seen that in view of  non-availability of the forest produce in the State of U.P.  the Government  constituted  a  committee  and  the Secretary Forest  Department was  its Chair-person. They had gone into  the question  of availability  and  allotment  of Khair wood  in the  State. They have imposed a cut off date, i.e., December 11, 1986 and allotment would be made, subject to the  availability of  forest produce, to those industries established prior  to the  aforesaid date.  It is  true,  as stated in  the order passed by the Director, that S.I. units registered  after   September   12,   1983,   were   allowed registration by  proceedings dated  February 25, 1984 with a condition that they will not apply for U.P. forest wood, and they would get it from outside the State. Even in respect of such industries  it was  also further stated that though the Director of  Industries granted provisional registration. It would only  be until  or before  December 11, 1986. In other words, complete  ban  on  registration  of  S.I.  units  was imposed on  or after  December 11, 1986 for allotment of the forest produced required for industries. Under these  circumstances, it  being a policy decision we  do   not  think   that  it  would  be  a  case  for  our interference.  The   High  Court  has  rightly  declined  to exercise its powers.

Sugar  Mill, Bijnor to formally reinstate him and  thereafter transfer  him to  the parent Department. The said  order came  to be  challenged by  the Mill  in the revision in the High Court. The High Court held that the was not entitled  to be reinstated. Since an enquiry was pending against him,  the Court  at the  most would have directed to conduct an  enquiry followed by action to be taken according to the  result of the enquiry. That order was not challenged and it  became final.  Thereafter,  the  appellant  filed  a revision petition  before  the  High  court  which  filed  a revision petition  before the  High Court  which came  to be dismissed. Thus, this appeal by special leave. Shri Pramod  Swarup, learned counsel for the appellant, contends that  when the appellant was initially appointed in the Meerut  Straw Board  and was  transferred to the Mill on deputation, he  was entitled to be repatriated when the Mill was not  inclined to retain his services and, therefore, the direction issued  by the Civil Court is valid in law and the High Court  was not  justified in  reversing that  order. As stated  earlier,   the  appellant   had  to   cross  several insurmountable hurdles,  namely, in  the suit  the appellant had not impleaded his employer M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills with whom  he  claimed  to  have  been  appointed.  He  suo  motu impleaded the  sugar Mill in the SLP filed in this Court and subsequently, it was deleted. Under these circumstances, the sugar Mill  against whom  the relief  sought for  was not  a http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 party to  the suit.  Therefore, the  suit was  liable to  be dismissed for non-joinder of necessary and proper party. The second difficulty  in the  way of the appellant was that the main order  was allowed  to become  final  and  he  did  not challenge the  same. Under  these circumstances,  the review order could  not have  more force  than the  original order. Therefore,  we  do  not  find  any  manifest  error  of  law warranting interference. The  appeal   is  accordingly  dismissed,  but  in  the circumstances, without  costs. The  interim order  passed by this Court stands dissolved.","This appeal  by special leave arises from the order of the Allahabad High Court,  made  on April  21, 1980. It is claimed by the appellant that he was transferred  on deputation  to S.B. Sugar Mills;  as a consequence, he was entitled  to go back  to his parent Department.

1665," O R D E R Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  [for short,  ’the Act] was published in the State Gazette on  January 16,  1975, acquiring  certain extent  of land part  of which  land  belonged  to  the  appellant  for construction of ’Panzar Talaw’. The Collector made his award under Section  11 on  November 15,  1977. Notice of award as required under  Section 12  was served  on the  appellant on November 17,  1977. On  an objection  raised, the  appellant made good  the deficit  court-fee. Thereafter  the Collector made the  reference to the Civil Court. During the reference proceedings, the  counsel appearing  for the  State raised a preliminary objection  as  to  the  maintainability  of  the reference which was upheld since requisite court-fee was not paid within the limitation of six weeks from the date of the receipt of the notice of the award, as required under clause (b) of  proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 18. On appeal, the High  Court upheld the contention by judgment dated 27th to 29th  April, 1982  and accordingly  dismissed the appeal. Thus this  appeal by special leave against the decree of the Bombay High Court. The only  question that  arises  for  consideration  is whether the  claimant is  required to  pay court-fee  on  an application seeking  reference under Section 18. We are at a loss to  understand that  a claimant  is required  to pay ad valoram court  fee on  an amount  awarded by  the  Collector under Section  11 for  seeking reference  under Section  18. What is  required is  to make  a  written  application  with particulars envisaged under Section 18(2) of the Act, to the Collector requiring the matter to be referred to civil Court to decide his objection regarding measurement of the land or the amount  of compensation  or the  person to  whom  it  is payable or  the apportionment of the compensation awarded to the persons interested. The Act is a self-contained Code and it does  not speak  of payment of any court-fee. It requires http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 only  that   the  application  should  be  made  within  the limitation prescribed  either in  clause (a)  or (b) of Sub- section (2)  of the  Act. It  is, therefore, clear that non- payment of the deficit court-fee, though wrongly made by the appellant,  is   not  a   necessary.  The  owner  or  person interested is not enjoined under law to pay any court-fee on the application  made under  Section 18(1) seeking reference for determination  of the  compensation by  the civil  court etc. The  civil court  and the  High Court,  therefore, have committed grave  error of  law in rejecting the claim of the appellant for determination of the compensation. The appeal  is accordingly  allowed and  the orders  of courts below  stand set  aside. The  Civil Court  shall  now proceed to  determine the  compensation according to law. No costs.","Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [for short,  ’the Act] was published in the State Gazette on January 16, 1975. The Collector made his award under Section  11 on November 15, 1977.

1666," J U D G M E N T S. N. VARIAVA, J. Before this Court a large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, granting to Complainants, interest at the rate of 18% per annum irrespective of the fact of each case.  This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice.  This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case.  This Court has held that the Consumer Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds misfeasance in public office.  This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with the amount of loss or injury.  This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has resulted in loss or injury.  This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or the Commission has to follow in future cases. This Court is now taking up the cases before it for disposal as per principles set out in earlier judgment.  On taking the cases we find that the copies of the Claim/Petitions made by the Respondent/Complainant and the evidence, if any, led before the District Forum are not in the paper book. This Court has before it the Order of the District Forum.  The facts are thus taken from that Order. In this case, the Respondent was allotted a plot bearing No. 472/P.L.A. Sector, Hisar. The Respondent paid substantial amounts but the possession was not delivered.  Thus the Respondent filed a complaint.  On these facts, the District Forum awarded interest @ 18% p.a. on the entire deposited amount from the date of deposit till offer of possession. The State Forum dismissed the Appeal and modified the order of the District Forum by awarding interest @ 12% p.a.  The Appellants went in Revision before the National Commission.  The National Commission dismissed the Revision filed by the Appellants relying upon its own decision in the case of Haryana Urban Development Authority v. Darsh Kumar and observing that interest @ 18% p.a. has been awarded by them under similar circumstances. As has been stated in so many matters, the Order of the National Commission cannot be sustained.  It cannot dispose of the matters by confirming award of interest irrespective of the facts of that http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2 case.  If the National Commission feels that facts of a case so justify it may award compensation/damages under a head as set out in Balbir Singh’s case (supra).  The Order of the National Commission is accordingly set aside. In this case possession was offered on 29th November, 1994 and taken in 1994.  The Appellants have also paid a sum of Rs.2,86,909/- to the Respondent on 19th April 1996.  In our view this is much more then what we would have directed the Appellants to pay.  However, for reasons set out in Balbir Singh’s case (supra) the Appellants cannot claim any refund.  We thus see no reason to interfere. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order is being passed taking into account special features of the case.   The Forum/Commission will follow the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh (supra) in future cases. With these observations, the Appeal stands disposed of with no order as to costs.",A large number of Appeals have been filed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority and/or the Ghaziabad Development Authority challenging Orders of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

1667," JUDGMENT O R D E R CIVIL APPEAL NO 1982 OF 2008 (Arising out of SLP) No. 9087 of 2006) Leave granted. This appeal is directed against the final order dated 9th of January, 2006 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in Letters Patent Appeal No.855 of 2004 by which the LPA was allowed and the writ petition allowed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court was rejected. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials on record, we are of the view that when the writ petition was entertained and allowed by the learned Single Judge, it was not proper for the Division Bench to dismiss the writ petition on the ground of delay and latches only. In that situation and in the facts of this case, LPA ought to have been heard by the High Court on merits. In this view of the matter, the order passed by the High Court is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the Division Bench of the High Court to decide the LPA on merits after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. There shall be no order as to costs.","This appeal is directed against the final order dated 9th of January, 2006 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in Letters Patent Appeal No.855 of 2004.
